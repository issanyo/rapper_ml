[Verse 1]
I'm sweating gasoline
Will somebody just come and wipe me down?
If you struck a match on me
I'd probably burn this motherfucker down

[Refrain]
From the ceiling to the ground
What's that beat? No, what's that sound?
Got me blazing all around, all around
Like-like-like-like

[Pre-Chorus]
Danja, gimme something on the rocks
And I'm a take you straight up
Got me popping like a mighty morphing Power Ranger
Heat it up until the Fire Marshal come complaining
Don't come, come, complaining, it's hot

[Chorus]
It's hot in here but I don't wanna cool off (Hey, fire)
You keep this up, watch all my clothes come off (Hey, fire)
You burning things up, sexy flame thrower (Hey, fire)
Sexy flame thrower, got me burning up, inferno

[Post-Chorus]
You can burn it up, more fire
You can burn it up, uh-huh
You can burn it up, more fire
You can burn it up, uh-huh

[Verse 2]
Most of the chicks you meet
Aren't like me, they don't even count
So don't get me at, sprinklers on
Watch these bitches drown

[Refrain]
From the ceiling to the ground
What's that beat? No, what's that sound?
Got me blazing all around, all around
Like-like-like-like

[Pre-Chorus]
Danja, gimme something on the rocks
And I'm a take you straight up
Got me popping like a mighty morphing Power Ranger
Heat it up until the Fire Marshal come complaining
Don't come, come, complaining, it's hot

[Chorus]
It's hot in here but I don't wanna cool off (Hey, fire)
You keep this up, watch all my clothes come off (Hey, fire)
You burning things up, sexy flame thrower (Hey, fire)
Sexy flame thrower, got me burning up, inferno

[Post-Chorus]
You can burn it up, more fire
You can burn it up, uh-huh
You can burn it up, more fire
You can burn it up, uh-huh

[Bridge]
Make 'em dance, girl, oh
Make 'em dance, oh
Make 'em dance, girl, oh
Make 'em dance, oh
Come make 'em dance, come make 'em dance (Hey)
Come make 'em dance, come make 'em dance (Hey)
Come make 'em dance, come make 'em dance (Hey)
Come make 'em dance, make 'em dance, girl

[Chorus]
It's hot in here but I don't wanna cool off (Hey, fire)
You keep this up, watch all my clothes come off (Hey, fire)
You burning things up, sexy flame thrower (Hey, fire)
Sexy flame thrower, got me burning up, inferno

[Outro]
You can burn it up
You can burn it up
You can burn it up
