[Intro: Guordan Banks]
Girl it don't get no realer
Had to call Chris Brown and Bryson Tiller
Cause I ain't tryna waste yo' time
Girl I just wanna know

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Guordan Banks]
Can I keep you in mind
Can I can I

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I like your bad attitude
Pull up on me, baby, with everything off
Tonight it's all about you, oh yeah
One on one, baby, all night
Your sex game strong, yeah
Girl I been too excited
Goin' 'bout it all wrong, yeah, yeah
I need to step it up, yeah, and turn them lights off, come here
Bring your body here to me, you know I like learnin'
We gon' break the bed, we gon' break the bed
You gon' get this head, girl, just spread your legs

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I know you like it, and girl I love your perfume
Girl it's all about you, let's light this fire up
If it's room for two, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Can I keep you in mind
Can I can I
Baby tell me
Can I keep you in mind
In my mind

[Verse 2: Guordan Banks]
You been running fronting for a long time
I know it ain't lyin' 'til the time right
Give me something special girl to brag about
Wanting all the commas and my money count
Don't do some girl, let's do some
You know you don't wanted always put me through some
I been patient for the girl that I seen in my dreams
And I won't let nothing come between

[Pre-Chorus: Guordan Banks]
Don't run I got so much for you
I know you feel the love is in the air
Don't move you got a lot to lose, baby
Cause if you walk away it won't be fair, oh baby

[Chorus: Guordan Banks & Chris Brown]
Can I keep you in mind
Can I can I
Can I keep you in mind
In my mind

[Verse 3: Bryson Tiller]
You got 'em wastin' your time, wastin' your time
What must I do to make you mine?
But you don't even gotta say it, nah nah
Tell me am I wastin' my time?
Even though we ain't together, whenever they ask me
I say that you're mine
But you've been out here sayin' different
Talkin' 'bout shit I say to them others
Girl you must of said no, must of said, oh no
But you don't feel the same, oh no, no no no

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I know you like it, and girl I love your perfume
Girl it's all about you girl, let's light this fire up
If it's room for two, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Guordan Banks]
Can I keep you in mind?
Baby tell me, can I, can I?
Baby tell me, oh yeah, yeah
Can I keep you in mind (in my mind)
Can I keep you in mind?
Baby tell me, can I, can I?
Baby tell me, oh yeah, yeah
Can I keep you in mind?
In my mind
