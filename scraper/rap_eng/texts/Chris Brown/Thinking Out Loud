[Intro]
Hey, this is for my girls
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey
This is for my girls, girls, girls, girls
Hey, hey this is for my girls
Hey,hey this is for my girls

[Verse 1]
I do the same thing, be in the party every weekend
But tonight it's just a little bit different
I love to bang bang, and all these shawtys got me feeling
Like they wanna do the same thing with me
Double take, it's two of them looking at me
Like they ready to leave
I can't explain it 'cause I ain't even ready to leave
But they pressuring me

[Pre-Chorus]
They want me to tap that, yeah
And I can feel them all over me
Or maybe it's just all in my head
But if you want it, girl, I'm good for it
Good for it, come on, come on
I'm the mood, shawty, you turn me on
She thought, ooh baby, ooh baby, it won't be long
A freaky invitation yeahh

[Chorus]
I know what you're saying, I'm feeling it too
I'm not a mind reader but I can hear you thinking
Hear you thinking out loud
I can hear you thinking, hear you thinking out loud
Girl, I can hear you thinking, hear you thinking out loud
I can hear you thinking, hear you thinking out loud, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Y'all must be on one
One too many shots of Henny got you hella touchy feely on each other
I'm 'bout to go dumb and I can tell what you been thinking
Reading your bodies like close captions, loud and clear
Sound so sexy to me, shawty, if you agree, let's get out of here
Y'all ain't even got to say a damn thing
'Cause I can tell

[Pre-Chorus]
They want me to tap that, yeah
And I can feel them all over me
Or maybe it's just all in my head
But if you want it, girl, I'm good for it
Good for it, come on, come on
I'm the mood, shawty, you turn me on
She thought, ooh baby, ooh baby, it won't be long
A freaky invitation right now, I know that

[Chorus]
I know what you're saying, I'm feeling it too
I'm not a mind reader but I can hear you thinking
Hear you thinking out loud
I can hear you thinking, hear you thinking out loud
Girl, I can hear you thinking,hear you thinking out loud
I can hear you thinking,hear you thinking out loud, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I know what you're saying, I'm feeling it too
I'm not a mind reader but I can hear you thinking
Hear you thinking out loud
I can hear you thinking, hear you thinking out loud
Girl, I can hear you thinking,hear you thinking out loud
I can hear you thinking,hear you thinking out loud, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Ladies, we can slip right out the back door
So we can get into some wild things
All that Patron got you loose huh, loose huh
Let's head back to my place, not thinking Nicki but m√©nage
You want it now and I can't wait
Y'all gon' make me love you tonight

[Chorus]
I know what you're saying, I'm feeling it too
I'm not a mind reader but I can hear you thinking
Hear you thinking out loud
I can hear you thinking, hear you thinking out loud
Girl, I can hear you thinking,hear you thinking out loud
I can hear you thinking,hear you thinking out loud, oh yeah
