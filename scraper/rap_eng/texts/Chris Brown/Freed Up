[Intro]
When a bitch say she fucked 20 niggas, I respect her more
Instead of running 'round this motherfucker lying all the time
Talking 'bout some
5 niggas, 5 niggas you cared about, shit

[Verse 1]
Bitch you lying and girl I'm built honest
Still living for today, tomorrow ain't promised
Holding on to the love cause the hate follows
When you young, getting money, yeah you date models
Let the cork pop off when we shake bottles
You don't need a glass, gulp, just take swallows
Yeah, young and reckless, I spike her beverage
Self medicated, pills or liquor, what's your preference?
She usually ain't the type to take rejection
She don't know her dad so the hate turned into affection
She only dreamed to be up in my section
Believing any lie they tell her just to get her naked
Bitches keep playing games like it's checkers
But bitch this chess and those DD's gon' be your blessing
I'm looking forward to all them text messages
Talking 'bout how you done, I love when bitches threaten me

[Chorus]
I'ma keep it real with you baby
Understand me, don't tell you lies
I feel your love is premeditated
Too complicated, never willing to try
When I locked it down, she freed up
Coco in her nose she loves the freedom
Now she changing niggas like the seasons
Got it good but I feel distant in my mind, can't help think I'm mastermind

[Verse 2]
She said follow me , she wanna fuck up a nigga's Valentine
Pardon me, only thing growing on me is the dollar signs
Oh baby, I'm only used to your ways
Say you in love and you ain't, try to be honest, you can't
You always tripping on the same minor drugs
I do for the piece of mind and you do when you 'bout to fuck
I leave, act up and leave you and something trap out the bando
But I want a nigga call the curtain, choppers fired and it's having the fam over
That's the thing, I love to hate so I got a whip for my bitch
If you think I'm cuffing, you should forget it

[Chorus]
I'ma keep it real with you baby
Understand me, don't tell you lies
I feel your love is premeditated
Too complicated, never willing to try
When I locked it down, she freed up
Coco in her nose she loves the freedom
Now she changing niggas like the seasons
Got it good but I feel distant in my mind, can't help think I'm mastermind

[Verse 3]
You never wanna hear it, you never wanna be there
You never take me serious, you piece of shit, let's be fair
Know you got it from your mama, the day I met her she said "Why he here?"
Where the fuck you put your heart at? Bitches that pulling ain't all that
You on another level, showing off, tryna make me jealous
All the homies that been a problem, nigga bring the weapons
AKs and the fans, disrespecting
They close to my kin, OHB shit

[Chorus]
I'ma keep it real with you baby
Understand me, don't tell you lies
I feel your love is premeditated
Too complicated, never willing to try
When I locked it down, she freed up
Coco in her nose she loves the freedom
Now she changing niggas like the seasons
Got it good but I feel distant in my mind, can't help think I'm mastermind
