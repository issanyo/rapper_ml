[Intro]
Cuff yo' chick
DJ Ill Will

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Was it something I said?
Was it something I did, oh?
Looking for an answer
'Cause I don't even know
Why you're so upset with me
Girl, what is this about?
Them other shawties
I don't care about

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, sit down
Only when we sexing is when I wanna hear you yelling out loud
Count down backwards from 10
Now ain't that much better?
Break down every little word
She said this, he said that
Don't believe none of them lies, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Wasting time fighting over shit that don't really matter
Wish I could start on a brand new chapter (Oh)
I done see this type of thing before
I already know how story unfolds
All I wanna do is love you right
Take my time
Read between the lines, girl (Read between the)
Read between the lines, girl

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
Here we go again, heard it all before
It's getting us nowhere fast
So let's we retrace our steps and figure out where we went wrong, girl
Let's talk this through, woah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, sit down
Only when we sexing is when I want to hear you yelling out loud
Count down backwards from 10
Now ain't that much better?
Break down every little word
She said this, he said that
Don't believe none of them lies, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Wasting time fighting over shit that don't really matter
Wish I could start on a brand new chapter (Oh)
I done see this type of thing before
I already know how story unfolds
All I wanna do is love you right
Take my time
Read between the lines, girl (Read between the)
Read between the lines, girl
