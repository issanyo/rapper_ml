[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah, ooh girl I see you lookin' my way (yeah, way)
Right now I see you back in my place (my place)
Ooh girl, I see you back in my bed (my bed)
Ooh girl, now don't you fuck with my head (ow!)

[Verse 1: Kap G & Chris Brown]
Sh-sh-shawty, swing my way
Yeah, I just wanted you to come to my place
Yeah, I'ma pull up in that i8
Yeah, she just want the wood like a fireplace
I ain't tryna intervene but how you fit that in them jeans?
I don't really need a driver, I'ma fuck you on the Benz
I'ma fuck you in so style, I'ma fuck you in Supreme
You know I won't play around, I be ballin' like Kareem
Na' mean? I be flexin' with my team

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Kap G]
What's your set, nigga? Throw it up

What you sippin', fool?
OHB, you can't fuck with one of us (woo)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kap G]
Ooh girl I, ooh girl, I see you lookin' my way (in my way)
No, for real
Yeah, right now I see you back in my place (oh, woah, my place, ooh, woah)
Ooh girl, I see you back in my bed (my bed)
At the crib
Ooh girl, now don't you fuck with my head (ow!)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Drivin' in that new shit (new)
Walked in the house like I love Lucy
Can't say shit to me (to me, yeah)
Respect me like Hov, girl, I got the Blueprint (yeah)
Tellin' my bitches it's over, yeah
I think that I'm textin' for closure
Baby, I'm tryna get to know ya (know ya)
Why these niggas keep pushin' up on ya? (Bop, bop, bop, bop)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Kap G]
What's your set, nigga? Throw it up
What you represent?
2 or 3, I put it in my cup
What you sippin', fool?
OHB, you can't fuck with one of us (OHB, woo)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kap G]
Ooh girl I, ooh girl, I see you lookin' my way (way, in my way)
No, for real
Yeah, right now I see you back in my place (oh, yeah, my place)
Ooh girl, I see you back in my bed (my bed)
At the crib
Ooh girl, now don't you fuck with my head (ow!)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & Kap G]
Bitches know they hoes when niggas still take 'em back
I'm prolly with your bitch, she rollin' up that pack
If I front it, I need it, gave you a brick, I need a quarter back
Told that bitch throw it back, know she gon' make it clap
Stop fuckin' with them lames
And he can get exchanged (brrrrp)
Let me upgrade you
I pull up with the gang (Kap!)
And you know that I see you
What you with? It's your payday, cyeah
You know, you’re in your own lane, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kap G]
Ooh girl I, ooh girl, I see you lookin' my way (way)
What it do? No, for real
Yeah, right now I see you back in my place (my place) Kap G
Ooh girl, I see you back in my bed (my bed)
At the crib
Ooh girl, now don't you fuck with my head (ow!)
