[Verse 1: Tinashe]
Live life like if I want, I do
If I want love, I get it (get it, I get it)
Fooled me twice, if I fall for you
If I go there, forget it

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe]
So you better stay up, player
Yeah, you better keep up, player
'Cause tonight is a game-changer
So you better stay up, player

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Playing with fire, if I burn, you do
If I hurt, you won't let it (you won't let it)
Stacked my deck like I ain't gon' lose
Like a victim, forget it

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe]
So you better stay up, player
Yeah, you better keep up, player
'Cause tonight is a game-changer
So you better stay up, player

[Chorus: Tinashe]
You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holding back, holding back
But it ain't enough
You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holding back, holding back
'Cause it ain't enough

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Alright, baby girl, I don't want them other bitches
You be talking that shit, calling me a player, yeah (oh)
Ain't no competition, fuck the opposition
I'm the man of my city, just like the mayor (ooh)
I met her in the hotel lobby
Then we started loving in the elevator (in the elevator)
You know I had to eat that
Tongue on her body, see you later, alligator (woo)
Rolling 'round in the bed, smacking her on her ass
She a stone-cold killer, .45 in the bag
Mama told her never mess with a nigga like me (like me)
I took her to Fruit Town to meet my OG
I took her to the west side, like, "What's up?"
We was on the east side, we fucked
Now we sitting court-side, P-dub
Put me in the bed, you ain't gotta worry 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe & Chris Brown]
So you better stay up, player (yeah, you better stay)
Yeah, you better keep up, player (up, player)
'Cause tonight is a game-changer
So you better stay up, player, up

[Chorus: Tinashe & Chris Brown]
You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holding back, holding back
But it ain't enough
You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holding back, holding back
'Cause it ain't enough

[Chorus: Tinashe & Chris Brown]
You and I make so much love (I don't wanna give up, nah)
Player (But you're making it rough, nah)
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back (You got me holding back, holding back)
You and I make so much love (I been wanna give up, nah)
Player (But you're making it rough, nah)
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back
'Cause it ain't enough

[Outro: Tinashe]
(Ain't enough) Player
(Ain't enough)
