[Verse 1]
I've tried, everything feels good the first time, damn right
Who am I to judge what you like? Oh baby
Why we always making it so hard?
You saying it's not my fault, but you still take it out on me

[Pre-Hook]
I know I ain't perfect, the way I'm treating you, you don't deserve it
Gave her too many shoes, too many purses, she got too many people in her ear, I don't like that
Fighting you, it ain't worth it, 'cause I always lose
Go to hell with all the games (all games), the decisions that you made, you've given up

[Hook]
Mama warned me 'bout someone like you
Feel like a goddamn fool, play with my heart, you tried
I never regret us, I choose just better, I'ma arguing better, tired and jealous
Making your life better, by putting my bread up
Give up the battle just to escape your love
Give up the battle just to escape your love

[Verse 2]
Party every weekend, I say fuck the club
We too busy beefing, I think you been cheating
She know when I'm deep in, I'ma fuck it up
And she too busy running places, calculating defense
Watch you make me sea sick, dick make you believe it
All the rings and everything I bought you, you can keep it
My mama told me 'bout you bitches
I'm single now, and throw this Rollie in the air yeah

[Pre-Hook]
I know I ain't perfect, the way I'm treating you, you don't deserve it
Gave her too many shoes, too many purses, she got too many people in her ear, I don't like that
Fighting you, it ain't worth it 'cause I always lose
Go to hell with all the games, the decisions that you made, you've given up

[Hook]
Mama warned me 'bout someone like you
Feel like a goddamn fool, play with my heart, you tried
I never regret us, I choose just better, I'ma arguing better, tired and jealous
Making your life better, by putting my bread up
Give up the battle just to escape your love

[Outro]
You're love (oh)
To escape your love (oh)
