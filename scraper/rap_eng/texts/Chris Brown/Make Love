[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Lil mama whatcha doing, what's up?
'Cause I ain't gotta work this weekend let's get up
I just wanna dance, and play a little bit and baby I'm the man, and shawty you the shit
Think about it, we could do something nasty
Well I got my energy up all in the club with the lights down low
And I got you, tipsy and you're all up on me pulling on my clothes
I ain't finished my drink but I want some more, girl get your purse, let me grab my coat
Got my keys so now we can roll back to the crib

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I wanna make love to my baby, do it all day, and we can do it all night long
I'm gonna make love to my baby, have it your way, but I like it with the lights on
I'ma make love to my baby, girl, get on top of me, and I'ma let you take it off
Tonight is your night, baby, so I'ma love you down

[Verse 2: Tyga]
All I think about, when she's not around
If I get to see her, I'm gon' take her down
Pull your tights down, throw 'em on the couch
Like I say put it in your mouth
Take your top off, ain't nobody round
Running around butt naked, this my house
All these thoughts on my mind I gotta get 'em out
Trying but I can't figure how
Remember in high school, I used to skip class just to sex you
Home room was the only place I could call you
Now it's like every time I call, never get through
All that bullshit that we been through
Damn I miss you, it's like you kick a nigga out
Moved on to the next one
I hope maybe we could work it out
Damn I be wishing you was here right now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I wanna make love to my baby, do it all day, and we can do it all night long
I'm gonna make love to my baby, have it your way, but I like it with the lights on
I'ma make love to my baby, girl, get on top of me, and I'ma let you take it off
Tonight is your night, baby, so I'ma love you down

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Kissing on your body, laying on top of me
From the bed to the ground, I'ma go down
Doing my thing, tell me when to stop, girl I wanna see, what you all about
Sweating like a sauna, put that dick on ya all night
While I got my energy up all the club with the lights down low
And I got you tipsy and you're all up on me pulling on my clothes
I ain't finished my drink but I want some more, girl get your purse lemme grab my coat
Got my keys so now we can roll back to the crib

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I wanna make love to my baby, do it all day, and we can do it all night long
I'm gonna make love to my baby, have it your way, but I like it with the lights on
I'ma make love to my baby, girl, get on top of me, and I'ma let you take it off
Tonight is your night, baby, so I'ma love you down
