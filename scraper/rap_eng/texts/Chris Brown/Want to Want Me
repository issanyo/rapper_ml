[Verse 1]
It's too hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor, nothing on me
And I can't take it no more, it's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door, where are my keys? 'Cause I gotta leave
In the back of the cab
I tipped the driver 'head of time, get me there fast
I got your body on my mind, I want it bad
Oh just the thought of you gets me so high, so high

[Chorus]
Oh you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing, oh I wouldn't do, wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you
Oh you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing, oh I wouldn't do, wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you
Just to get up next to you

[Verse 2]
You open the door
Wearing nothing but a smile down to the floor
And you whisper in my ear, "Baby, I'm yours"
Oh just the thought of you gets me so high, so high

[Chorus]
Oh you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing, oh I wouldn't do, wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you
Oh you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing, oh I wouldn't do, wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you
Oh you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing, oh I wouldn't do, wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you
Just to get up next to you

[Bridge]
Oh just the thought of you
Gets me so high, so high
Oh just the thought of you
Gets me so high, so high

[Chorus]
Oh you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing, oh I wouldn't do, wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you
Oh you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing, oh I wouldn't do, wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you
Just to get up next to you
Just to get up next to you, baby
Just to get up next to you
