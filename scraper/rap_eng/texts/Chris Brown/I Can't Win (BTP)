[Verse 1]
She my moon and my sun, you're my day and my night
She the smoke to my blunt, it ain't wrong, it ain't right
I don't wanna lose her but I can't live without you
This shit is only getting worse and either way I'mma lose

[Pre-Chorus]
Responsibility, versus reality, oh
Instead of making you hate me, I have to make you love me
Never thought I'd be crucified for trying to be honest
I'm done with hiding, it is what is, no use in trying to pretend

[Chorus]
I can't win
What you saying, what you saying? Oh no
I can't win
What you saying, what you saying, what you saying, what you saying? No woah
I ain't with the one I love cause I love the two I'm with
I ain't with the one I love cause my heart is literally split
And it drives me insane and everyday is different
No conclusion

[Pre-Chorus]
Responsibility, versus reality, oh
Instead of making you hate me, I have to make you love me
Never thought I'd be crucified for trying to be honest
I'm done with hiding, it is what is, no use in trying to pretend

[Chorus]
I can't win
What you saying, what you saying?
I can't win
What you saying, what you saying, what you saying, what you saying? Oh baby
I ain't with the one I love cause I love the two I'm with
I ain't with the one I love cause my heart is literally split
And it drives me insane and everyday is different
No conclusion

[Bridge]
Instead of making you hate me, I have to make you love me
Never thought I'd be crucified for trying to be honest
I'm done with hiding, it is what is, no use in trying to pretend
I can't win
