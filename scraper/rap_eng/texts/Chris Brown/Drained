If you can't stop the way you feel
When things don't go your way and takes a turn for the worst
And I shouldn't have done you wrong babe

There's some things I know that I'm gon' regret
Caused you pain since the day we met
Now you barely got anything left
'Cause I was draining your love

The more I stayed the more that I caused you stress

Now you barely got anything left
'Cause I was draining your love

The more I stayed the more that I caused you stress
Know it ain't easy to just forget
It's not your fault baby, you were the best
I was just draining your love

Hate to beat myself up but I gotta fess up
Really made a mess of your heart, of your heart
Baby please forgive me, start a new beginning
I'll pick up the broken pieces to your heart and I know that I

There's some things I know that I'm gon' regret
Caused you pain since the day we met
Now you barely got anything left
'Cause I was draining your love

The more I stayed the more that I caused you stress
Know it ain't easy to just forget
It's not your fault, baby, you were the best
I was just draining your love

There's some things I know that I'm gone regret
Caused you pain since the day we met
Now you barely got anything left
'Cause I was draining your love

The more I stayed the more that I caused you stress
Know it ain't easy to just forget
