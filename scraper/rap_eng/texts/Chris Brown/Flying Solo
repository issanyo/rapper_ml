[Verse 1: Andre Merritt]
Departure time, 7:30, I'm packed and ready to go
First class ticket outta here
I think it's time to put it back in gear
No more standing by, I'm tryna stay clear, oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Turbulence got me nervous, I should have never flown
Scared when you fly alone again
You know the atmosphere wasn't perfect
I'm thinking to myself was it worth it?

[Pre-Chorus: Andre Merritt & Chris Brown]
Layover's almost over, I can see clearly, no more stormy weather
Exit row, don't pull on the lever, lever
This gon' be my final destination
No more sitting round having my time wasted
You say it's now or never, I pick never
We can be together, so calm down
No more red eye, late nights
I'm one way, no more connected flights, when

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Andre Merritt]
When we stared out, knew this relationship was unhealthy
You broke the code, never thought that you would stoop so low
You got me flying solo
Now you crying, talking 'bout you can't live without me, yeah
My heart is sold, shoulda never, ever left me this cold
You got me flying solo
Solo solo solo, solo solo solo
Solo solo solo
You got me flying, you got me flying solo
Solo solo solo, solo solo solo
Solo solo solo
You got me flying, you got me flying solo

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Touching down, 11:30
I'm rushing through the doors, I'm in a good place now
I can't find my baggage and I don't even want it back
And I don't wanna have you no more
I don't need to carry on, it's gonna weight me down
You didn't think that I would find out
Whether or not, who is wrong or right
I can't talk now, I gotta catch another flight

[Pre-Chorus: Andre Merritt & Chris Brown]
Layover's almost over, I can see clearly, no more stormy weather
Exit row, don't pull on the lever, lever
This gon' be my final destination
No more sitting round having my time wasted
You say it's now or never, I pick never
We can be together, so calm down
No more red eye, late nights
I'm one way, no more connected flights, when

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Andre Merritt]
When we stared out, knew this relationship was unhealthy
You broke the code, never thought that you would stoop so low
You got me flying solo
Now you crying, talking 'bout you can't live without me, yeah
My heart is sold, shoulda never, ever left me this cold
You got me flying solo
Solo solo solo, solo solo solo
Solo solo solo
You got me flying, you got me flying solo
Solo solo solo, solo solo solo
Solo solo solo
You got me flying, you got me flying solo

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Thought I was scared to fly without you here
Now you can't get under my skin, like you did before, why
I was so reluctant to walk out on us
So now I'm taking back my life, goodbye, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Andre Merritt]
When we stared out, knew this relationship was unhealthy
You broke the code, never thought that you would stoop so low
You got me flying solo
Now you crying, talking 'bout you can't live without me, yeah
My heart is sold, shoulda never, ever left me this cold
You got me flying solo
Solo solo solo, solo solo solo
Solo solo solo
You got me flying, you got me flying solo
Solo solo solo, solo solo solo
Solo solo solo
You got me flying, you got me flying solo
