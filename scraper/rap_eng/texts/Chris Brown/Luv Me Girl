[Verse 1: Lloyd]
Baby, baby, we got an engagement
Banging, banging like my body fall
Changing lanes when we hop up in my car
We gon' ride, ride this train
We gon' take it fast and slow and we gon' shut it down and
Darling, darling, girl, we gon' be riding
Vibing, sliding, hollering, talking 'bout
Where they do that at, where they, where they do that at, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Lloyd]
I believe this could be something right
So tell me where to meet up with you tonight
So I can break you off something proper like
Where they do that at, where they, where they do that at

(Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Lady, lately we've been love making
Crazy, raving, so out of control
Baby, babe, don't you come up in this room
Show you I'm 'bout no games
We can take it slow and fast and I'ma put it down and
Pound it, ground it, talking 'bout devouring
Power, grinding, hour after hour
Where they do that at, where they, where they do that at

So tell me where to meet up with you tonight
