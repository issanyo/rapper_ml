[Verse 1]
Don't fall for me, I won't fall for you
I bruise easily, it takes too long to recover
When you're broken, nothing even matters
And when you're shattered, it's hard to find the pieces scattered

[Chorus]
Why, oh, why?
Must it be so complicated?
Why, oh, why?
Can we stand in love?
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Can we stand in love?

[Refrain]
Don't fall for me, I won't fall for you
I bruise easily, it takes too long to recover

[Chorus]
Why, oh, why?
Must it be so complicated?
Why, oh, why?
Can we stand in love?
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Can we stand in love?
Can we stand in love?

[Verse 3]
Oh, don't fall for me, nah, I won't fall for you
I bruise easily, it takes too long to recover
I'm lonely, heart broken, you're not wrapped up in my arms tonight
Don't leave, no I,  it takes too long to recover

[Chorus]
Why, oh, why?
Must it be so complicated?
Why, oh, why?
Can we stand in love?
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Can we stand in love?
Can we stand in love?
