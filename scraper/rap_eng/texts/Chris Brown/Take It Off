[Chorus]
You know, I been patient
But I just can’t take it
This love, we should make it
Take it off, take it off
I’m anticipating
Please don’t keep me waiting
Baby, just get naked
Take it off, take it off

[Verse 1]
You got me gone and I’m with it
You turn me on and I get it
Your ass fat, I’m feelin' that
One hunnid, girl, no gimmicks
Sendin' pics to my phone
Every time that I’m gone
Damn, girl, you’re so bad
You make me wanna come home

[Pre-Chorus]
You like your hair pulled back
You like your legs lift up
Like when I kiss your neck
I know you like it rough
You want it from the back
I’ll give you what you want
You want your ass getting smacked
And then we smoke a blunt
‘Cause when I look into your eyes
Baby, I can see you a freak
When I get with you tonight
Baby, I’m gon’ put you to sleep, oh, woah

[Chorus]
You know, I been patient
But I just can’t take it
This love, we should make it
Take it off, take it off
I’m anticipating
Please don’t keep me waiting
Baby, just get naked
Take it off, take it off

[Verse 2]
We should make this private
Change our bodies climate
It’s hot in here, so hot in here
Don't you try to fight it
You got me thinking ‘bout cuffin’
Every time, we fuckin’
You say you wanna go all night
Baby girl, that's nothin’

[Pre-Chorus]
You like your hair pulled back
You like your legs lift up
Like when I kiss your neck
I know you like it rough
You want it from the back
I’ll give you what you want
You want your ass getting smacked
And then we smoke a blunt (oh yeah)
‘Cause when I look into your eyes
Baby, I can see you a freak (oh yeah, girl)
When I get with you tonight
Baby, I’m gon’ put you to sleep, oh, woah

[Chorus]
You know, I been patient
But I just can’t take it
This love, we should make it
Take it off, take it off
I’m anticipating
Please don’t keep me waiting
Baby, just get naked
Take it off, take it off

[Bridge]
You should let me take you out of this party
Let me, put my hands all over your body
And I can tell it, girl, you wanna be on me
On me, on me, oh-oh

[Chorus]
You know, I been patient
But I just can’t take it
This love, we should make it
Take it off, take it off
I’m anticipating
Please don’t keep me waiting
Baby, just get naked
Take it off, take it off
