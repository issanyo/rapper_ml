[Intro: Chris Brown & Lil Wayne]
I know what girls like, I know what they want
I know what girls like, so I’mma give it to ‘em
Chris, I got you

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Okay, Weezy F baby, polo horses on my underwear
Baby, I’m a beast and your boyfriend a gummy bear
Well can I at least put some kisses on you under there?
Man, it ain’t my fault, I want you badder than some fucking air
Hundred millionaire, I'll take you anywhere
I put a ring on it and make you really care
Now what’s really good? It’s young mullah, baby
Yeah, guns and roses and tulips, baby
I do this, baby, now come and do it with me
Because I’m right, I’m right, like a New Ammendment
Now I'm right with your ass
And if you fall in love after tonight, it's your bad

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
She like it over here, she like the way I do it
She want to lay back, so I put her on to it
I know what your girl like, I know what your girl want
I know what your girl like, wam ba bam
She says she like the boss, call lil celo
Shawty like the boss so I let her swipe the visa
I know what your girl like, I know what your girl want
I know what your girl like, wam ba bam

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
And I hear she got a man at home
And when he calls she don’t pick up the phone
'Cause he don’t give her what I do
So I'm asking you
What are you gonna do?
She wanna make me her boo
She wanna say never go

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So I’m letting you know
I know what your girl like
I know what your girl want
I know what your girl like
And I’m the only one to make her say oh, oh, oh
I’m just letting you know oh, oh, oh
I know what girls like
I know what they want
I know what girls like
And I’m the only one to make her say oh
I know what your girl like
I know what your girl want
I know what your girl like
And I’m the only one to make her say oh

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
She like to get frisky, every time she see me
And she can't pronounce her name 'cause her lips are shaking
I know what your girl like, I know what your girl want
I know what your girl like, wam ba bam
Her hands ups and down, can’t get enough of it
She can break it down every time we dancing
I know what your girl like, I know what your girl want
I know what your girl like, wam ba bam

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
And I hear she got a man at home
And when he calls she turns off her phone
'Cause he don’t give her what I do
So I'm asking you
What are you gonna do?
She wanna make me her boo
She wanna say never go

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So I’m letting you know
I know what your girl like
I know what your girl want
I know what your girl like
And I’m the only one to make her say oh, oh, oh
I’m just letting you know oh, oh, oh
I know what girls like
I know what they want
I know what girls like
And I’m the only one to make her say oh
I know what your girl like
I know what your girl want
I know what your girl like

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Only tryna keep it real
I keep telling her to chill
I can’t keep her off my dick
So what you want me to do about it? Hey
You can't blame her for getting what she needs
And I can’t deny it when she’s asking for me
Hey 'cause I know what she wants
So tell me what you gonna do about it?
What are you gonna do?
She wanna make me her boo
She wanna say never go

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So I’m letting you know
I know what your girl like
I know what your girl want
I know what your girl like
And I’m the only one to make her say oh, oh, oh
I’m just letting you know oh, oh, oh
I know what girls like
I know what they want
I know what girls like
And I’m the only one to make her say oh
I know what your girl like
I know what your girl want
I know what your girl like
And I’m the only one to make her say oh
