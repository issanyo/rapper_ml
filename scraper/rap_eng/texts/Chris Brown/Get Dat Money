[Intro: Chris Brown]
Look how she up and down that pole
Just clap that ass up on that pole
Twerk, twerk, twerk, aw yeah
Now pop that pussy for a real nigga
Now do it, get that money, baby
Now pop that pussy for a real nigga
Go ahead and get that money, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look how she up and down that pole
Stripper bitches, got a couple singles for you
Just clap that ass up on that pole
Twerk, twerk, twerk
Aw yeah, now pop that pussy for a real nigga
Now do it, get that money, baby (ah)
Now pop that pussy for a real nigga (yeah)
Go ahead and get that money, baby

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Hundred dollar bottle, what the strippers swallow?
Malaya Blacc Chyna, shout out to Tyga
Red Bottoms just to match the 'rari Spider
Plain Jane Rollie got them bitches on fire
Now whoever say I cuff hoes
I just break the band on the bitch that's on that pole
Pussy poppin', got the squad turnin' up with hoes
Ace of Spades, VIP, we see TV like show
Now oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Got spikes of red all on my shoes
We global like we on the news
Stay in the best designer, we be on the news, let's get it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look how she up and down that pole
Stripper bitches, got a couple singles for you
Just clap that ass up on that pole
Twerk, twerk, twerk
Aw yeah, now pop that pussy for a real nigga
Now do it, get that money, baby (ah)
Now pop that pussy for a real nigga (yeah)
Go ahead and get that money, baby

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Came flippin', I bought it, when I came through in that foreign
Only fuck with them bad bitches, them square bitches be borin'
She need five stacks on that hair, coke, pills I'm on
Been gettin' money all year, all them cribs I own
Shawty help me slangin' fish to meet me at the yard
Goddamn, young nigga made it hot
Shawty bent it over, told me land on it
Came with a 100 large, Uncle Sam on 'em
She spinnin' on the top like a ceilin' fan
I can catch a rico off the Instagram
Wrist wrapped up, John Wall
Stackin' money up, wall to wall

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look how she up and down that pole
Stripper bitches, got a couple singles for you
Just clap that ass up on that pole
Twerk, twerk, twerk
Aw yeah, now pop that pussy for a real nigga
Now do it, get that money, baby (ah)
Now pop that pussy for a real nigga (yeah)
Go ahead and get that money, baby
