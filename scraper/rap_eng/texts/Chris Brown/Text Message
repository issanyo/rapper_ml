[Verse 1: Tyga]
Wassup with you? What you doin' tonight?
Said I hope it's me tonight then I book you a flight
Oh what a night, sleep over like it's junior high
We gettin' high, high ceilin's lookin' at your life
Rain, snow, or shine, she there every time
Hit you with that non-chalant "I'm fine," crazy sex drive left you feelin' right
Middle of the night, midnight, do ya like semi-pics, triple X
Baby know it's on sight so

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Tell me how to get there, send me your address
Tell me how to get there
Started with a text message, ended up with sex
Yes it's true, I wanna be on you
Started with a text message, ended up with sex
Yes it's true, I wanna be on you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
LOL, smiley face, the emoji with the tongue out
Now I'm kissin' you, touchin' you, freakin' you over at your house
Girl we started on the floor, now we face to face
Start a little slow, now pick up the pace
Everything I told you I was gonna do
I did it, well accept it we ain't get to drink
Your body, I want it until the mornin'
I can't lie for you I'm a love-a-holic

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Tell me how to get there, already be undressed
Tell me how to get there
Started with a text message, ended up with sex
Yes it's true, I wanna be on you
Started with a text message, ended up with sex
Yes it's true, I wanna be on you

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
LOL, smiley face, the emoji with the tongue out
Now I'm kissin' you, touchin' you, freakin' you over at your house
It started with my phone
Then we got to, to the point where I can't even leave you alone

[Verse 3: Tyga]
It's crazy right? Everyday I shuffle, you my ace of spades
I try to keep you in the deck but you never stay
No FaceTime bae, she just want me face to face
Put you on lock, now you got keys to the place
I was really fuckin' with you, told myself not to get attached
There goes that and all them other girls I had, that's a wrap
I ain't mad, one of you was worth a million them
I'm a millionaire, never leave and can't believe it all

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Started with a text message, ended up with sex
Yes it's true, I wanna be on you
Started with a text message, ended up with sex
Yes it's true, I wanna be on you

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
LOL, smiley face, the emoji with the tongue out
Now I'm kissin' you, touchin' you, freakin' you over at your house
