[Intro]
Picture Perfect, Hurricane Chris, Bow Weezy
Chris Brown, remix, go

[Chorus: Chris Brown & will.i.am]
You might've seen her on every cover
Of every magazine but can't nobody get her but me
Uh-oh, there she go, uh-oh, there she go
Uh-oh, there she go, can't nobody get her but me

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Hot damn, let me tell you man
She looks so good I'mma say it again
So good that I can't explain
Hen she do what she do, she's gon' do her thing
Over here Ms. Lane, come on, get fly with a Superman
You ain't got to worry, I won't play no games, baby tonight, yeah
So don't front, you know you wanna stay
It's all fun, yeah yeah, so baby come and play

[Chorus: Chris Brown & will.i.am]
It's picture perfect, the way you work it girl
What's your purpose? Cause I deserve it girl
Before we get into something crazy
All you fellas back up off my lady
Get you one cause I got that one, get you one cause I got that one
Get you one cause I got that one, get you one cause I got that, got that
It's the way she wears her clothes, the beauty overload
The definition of a star
You might've seen her on every cover
Of every magazine but can't nobody get her but me
Uh-oh, there she go, uh-oh, there she go
Uh-oh, there she go, can't nobody get her but me

[Verse 2: Hurricane Chris]
Say lil mama lemme holla cause I'm feeling dirty
Gotta get you up in a position, have you feeling flirty
And you already know my status, I'll be back to the feeling
Part of the club instead of hollering, I'mma get it
H-U double R-I to the cane
Hop in my whip and let me beat it out the frame
But if you bend your waist back I can beat it up in flames
I can hit you chick from a distance
I hit it and quit it cause she probably won't let you hit it
I got a lot of money that don't mean that I'mma trick
That Lamborghini match the yellow diamonds on my wrist
You ain't on a level to be talking 'bout my chick
She don't wanna holla, I'll still be your sidekick
I don't wanna holla so I told her like this
Baby how you doing? I'm Chris and that's Chris, I like that

[Chorus: Chris Brown & will.i.am]
Get you one cause I got that one, get you one cause I got that one
Get you one cause I got that one, get you one cause I got that, got that
It's the way she wears her clothes, the beauty overload
The definition of a star
You might've seen her on every cover
Of every magazine but can't nobody get her but me
Uh-oh, there she go, uh-oh, there she go
Uh-oh, there she go, can't nobody get her but me

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
Hot fresh off the UCP tour
See you got girls, but I bet I got way more
Who you know who get girls quite like this, man?
My girls cover King, Magazine and Blackman
When it comes to the chicks, they just like me
I ain't gotta ask, they just do it like Nike
See if you want one, bet I got 'em
Bow make 'em heal, I ain't talking 'bout college, nah
I do girls like I do my clothes, I wear 'em one time then I go back for more
Cause she want me to trip, well I don't do that dough and if your man get lost like the TV show, skidadle
She came through, I gave Chris her friend
You can dream though, my shawty a 10, ya dig yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & will.i.am]
Get you one cause I got that one, get you one cause I got that one
Get you one cause I got that one, get you one cause I got that, got that
It's the way she wears her clothes, the beauty overload
The definition of a star

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
Low key, my energy on E
Bright lights and cameras flash like it's the police
She spilled her drink on my Polo fleece
Speeding, and she all on me
Came to the party with a bunch of OGs
Ladies wearing crown holders and a bunch fn Coogi
Now they looking and the fellas know what I got
Can't nobody get her but me
Fliest thing in this spot
Prettiest thing that you ever seen
Hold up, wait, stop
Wanna take her picture, you ain't gon' get it for free
Do you got what it takes to get down
Lil mama, the way she working she breaking it to the ground
Twerking and working her body, hypnotic just to the sound, can't nobody get her but me

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Can't nobody get her but me
