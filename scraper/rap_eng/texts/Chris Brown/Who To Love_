[Verse 1: Dewain Whitmore]
I hate to admit it, but I need lovin'
But if it's gonna be this hard
Then I don't need nothing
Everything you say is like a crossword puzzle
Always tryna put it together
I don't, I don't need that, no
I got my feet on the gas though
I don't need anyone slowing me down

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I just don't know who to love
Don't know who to trust
My heart's been broke so many times
I would be a fool to love
Be a fool to love
'cause I'm done with waiting now
I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, Love you
I said I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, love you

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't need multiple
I just need comfortable
I don't need multiple
I just need -
I don't need multiple
I just need comfortable
I don't need multiple
I get, get -

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Now I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, Love you (ooh, ooh, get, get)
I said I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, love you (ooh, ooh, get, get)

[Verse 2: Dewain Whitmore]
Everything you put me through, for no damn reason
Tryna fix the problem when I say I'm leaving
I believe it before, now I just don't believe it
I don't think you're playing for keeps
I don't, I don't need that, no
I got my feet on the gas though
I don't need anyone slowing me down

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I just don't know who to love
Don't know who to trust
My heart's been broke so many times
I would be a fool to love
Be a fool to love
'cause I'm done with waiting now
I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, Love you
I said I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, love you

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't need multiple
I just need comfortable
I don't need multiple
I just need -
I don't need multiple
I just need comfortable
I don't need multiple
I get, get -

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Now I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, Love you (ooh, ooh, get, get)
I said I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, love you (ooh, ooh, get, get)
