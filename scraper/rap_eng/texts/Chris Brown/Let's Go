[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
All day, girl, I had you on my mind
And I'm thinking 'bout maybe later me and you can spend some time
And you can help me spend my money, me and you can feel alive
And let's forget about the world 'cause, baby, it's just you and I, I, I

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Let's get crazy, alright, come on, let's go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Crazy, alright, come on, let's go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Crazy, alright, come on, let's go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Crazy, alright, come on, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's

[Verse 2: will.i.am & Chris Brown]
Dancing on the dance floor, girl, it's you I adore
Step off stage, I scream for more, my native trunk got love galore (let's)
Snap my fingers, make you mine, if not, I snap a second time
After that I guarantee you will be standing next to me (let's)
My baby, baby, baby, you're sexy, drive me crazy
I feel like I've been blazing, puffing purple hazing
Well, girl, this love is natural, forever undetachable
So, what you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & will.i.am]
Let's go, what you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for?
Let's go, what you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for?
Let's go, what you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for? (This is love)
What you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Let's get crazy, alright, come on, let's go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Crazy, alright, come on, let's go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Crazy, alright, come on, let's go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Crazy, alright, come on, let's go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, let's go
You gotta, you gotta get get get crazy, get get get crazy
You gotta, you gotta get get get crazy, let's go, let's

[Verse 3: will.i.am & Chris Brown]
Love you like my boom-box, make me wanna moonwalk
No, this ain't no old love, Lamborghini countach (let's)
Mrs. Maseratti, hop inside my Bugatti
Girl, I'ma make you mine, hot damn you fine, I want your body (let's)
I want, I want, I want you, love me, damn, why don't you?
Girl, this ain't no puppy love, grown man shit, no youngster (let's)
I would love to touch you, I ain't tryna rush you
But what you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & will.i.am]
Let's go, what you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for?
Let's go, what you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for?
Let's go, what you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for? (This is love)
What you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Let's get crazy, yeah
Let's get crazy, oh, woah
You gotta, you gotta know
Let's get crazy, you gotta know, ooh, ooh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Let's go
You gotta, you gotta get get get crazy
Let's go
Get get get crazy
You gotta, you gotta get get get crazy
Let's go

[Outro: Chris Brown]
All day, girl, I had you on my mind
And I'm thinking 'bout maybe later me and you can spend some time
And you can help me spend my money, me and you can feel alive
And let's forget about the world 'cause, baby, it's just you and I, I, I
