Damn, girl you better stop it
You told me tell them other girls to stop calling and I did
Always think I'm with another broad when you're not here
It's the truth, why would I lie to you? What are you doing? Worried 'bout what I'm doing
Say you got that proof, girl you blind to it, I'mma pour it baby
Had to let you know it baby, thought you knew it all
Chopped down, screw it up, guess I have to slow it up for you this time
Yeah always thinking 'bout you and I, don't ever question if I'm down for you or not
Cause girl you know I'm down for ya
Whenever shit got deep, I woulda drowned for ya
Come be a queen, I got this crown for ya
I love all the way that I'm chucking downs for ya
