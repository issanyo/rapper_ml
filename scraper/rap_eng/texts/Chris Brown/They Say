[Chorus]
They say I'm changing cause they all doing the same thing
I bet you think that I'll fly away from you, but I wouldn't do that
Now they're saying I'm crazy cause I wanna do it my way
I bet you think that I'll fly away from you, but I wouldn't do that
Let's take it back to the start, oh
Let's take it back to the start, oh
Let's take it back to the start, oh
Let's take it back to the start

[Verse 1]
This reminds you, that you can't go on for no one
But they talking like they don't know and all of 'em sound the same
They're so quick to judge someone, but they thought of me different before
Guess I'm assort from now, guess what they say

[Chorus]
They say I'm changing cause they all doing the same thing
I bet you think that I'll fly away from you, but I wouldn't do that
Now they're saying I'm crazy cause I wanna do it my way
I bet you think that I'll fly away from you, but I wouldn't do that
Let's take it back to the start, oh
Let's take it back to the start, oh
Let's take it back to the start, oh
Let's take it back to the start

[Verse 2]
So does this define you? Do you really believe what they say?
I didn't think so, but they talking like you acting strange
They're so quick to judge someone and it's really, really getting old
Plus I'm so numb now, they say

[Chorus]
They say I'm changing cause they all doing the same thing
I bet you think that I'll fly away from you, but I wouldn't do that
Now they're saying I'm crazy cause I wanna do it my way
I bet you think that I'll fly away from you, but I wouldn't do that
Let's take it back to the start, oh
Let's take it back to the start, oh
Let's take it back to the start, oh
Let's take it back to the start

[Bridge]
Do, oh, if you do oh
If you do oh, yes you do oh
That you do, oh, that you do, ooh
That you do, oh whoa

[Chorus]
They say I'm changing cause they all doing the same thing
I bet you think that I'll fly away from you, but I wouldn't do that
Now they're saying I'm crazy cause I wanna do it my way
I bet you think that I'll fly away from you, but I wouldn't do that
Let's take it back to the start, oh
Let's take it back to the start, oh
Let's take it back to the start, oh
Let's take it back to the start
