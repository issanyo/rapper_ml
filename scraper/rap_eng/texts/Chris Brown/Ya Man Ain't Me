[Intro]
Hey girl, what's up? You've been going through it, huh?
And I know your man ain't been treating you right, but your man ain't me, listen

[Verse 1]
Girl I bet that he be acting all cocky like
Like he deserves you and you so lucky to be with him
Bet he be treating you rude, always got an attitude
Like he's the only dude made for you, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
But I bet he didn't count on, a little nigga like me coming 'round
Giving you things to think about cause I know what's up
Since he ain't tryna step it up, don't you think you should give him up?
Cause he ain't worth the love

[Chorus]
Stop tripping
I know you got a man but girl he's slipping
I can see myself getting in where I fit in
I want you to see, just how much your man ain't me cause
He ain't fly, he don't even drive
Cause when you wanna sneak out inn the middle of the night baby I'm your guy
I might be since he ain't being all that he can be
Baby please your man, your man ain't me

[Verse 2]
Girl I know that you be wishing he was nothing like
Like that playa type and you so lucky to be with him
Wish that he treated you cool and didn't cheat on you
Like you're just another girl in his crew, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
But I bet he didn't count on, oh a little nigga like me coming 'round
Giving you things to think about cause I know what's up, yeah
Since he ain't tryna step it up, don't you think you should give him up?
Cause he ain't worth your love, you need to stop tripping

[Chorus]
Stop tripping
I know you got a man but girl he's slipping
I can see myself getting in where I fit in
I want you to see, just how much your man ain't me cause
He ain't fly, he don't even drive
Cause when you wanna sneak out inn the middle of the night baby I'm your guy
I might be since he ain't being all that he can be
Baby please your man, your man ain't me

[Bridge]
Can you see
You and him ain't meant to be together, life with me will be better?
Oh oh oh, yes, let him lave you'll be doing yourself a favour
Girl I'm just tryna save you

[Chorus]
Stop tripping
I know you got a man but girl he's slipping
I can see myself getting in where I fit in

He ain't fly, he don't even drive
Cause when you wanna sneak out inn the middle of the night baby I'm your guy
