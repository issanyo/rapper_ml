[Verse 1: Andre Merritt]
You don't see me the same no more
It's hard to see the light with closing doors
Don't treat me like, like I'm invisible
Your tone with me, it's not the usual
We scream, we fight, saying things that we both regret
And that's not right, that you could just forget me like that
You never try, always taking the easy route
Always taking the easy route, never wanting to work it out

[Pre-Chorus: Andre Merritt]
You want to be free
You want to leave me
I can't believe
'Cause without you, baby, I'm incomplete

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Am I erased?
Just a segment of your imagination, yeah
I'm feeling replaced
Like a faded picture where you can't see my face
I'm scratched out, erased, erased, erased
I'm scratched out, erased, erased, erased
I'm scratched out, erased, erased, erased
I'm scratched out, erased, erased, erased

[Verse 2: Andre Merritt]
In memory of what we used to call love
I reminisce what used to be us
Remember when, when I was the most
Important to you but now I'm a ghost
The trust has died, there's no way we can bring it back
You live a lie with all those bars and strings attached
'Cause in your eyes a part of you just wants me back
And all of me just wants you back, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Andre Merritt]
You want to be free
You want to leave me
I can't believe
Am I, am I

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Am I erased?
Just a segment of your imagination, yeah
I'm feeling replaced
Like a faded picture where you can't see my face
I'm scratched out, erased, erased, erased
I'm scratched out, erased, erased, erased
I'm scratched out, erased, erased, erased
I'm scratched out, erased, erased, erased

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Can anybody see me, see me now?
I'm erased from the crowd
So cold and I don't know how
Find me now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Am I erased?
Just a segment of your imagination, yeah
I'm feeling replaced
Like a faded picture where you can't see my face
I'm scratched out, erased, erased, erased
I'm scratched out, erased, erased, erased
I'm scratched out, erased, erased, erased
I'm scratched out, erased, erased, erased
