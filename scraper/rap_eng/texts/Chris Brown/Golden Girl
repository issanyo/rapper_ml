[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Your place, midnight
When I come through, I ring your doorbell twice
When I come through, I do the things you like
Like I'm room service
And don't you take me
For every chick tryna take all your shit
'Cause I ain't even tryna get none of your shit
Please, I don't want none of your

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't be star struck
When we going under these covers
You can have the key to my hand cuffs
Man up, boy, just play along
I'll give it to you proper
Play nurse and you play doctor
Boy, you know I got ya
I know what you like

[Chorus: Andre Merritt & Chris Brown]
You like the way I shine, oh yeah
And I'm 10 times part of a dime , oh yeah
I'm your golden girl, golden girl
Your golden girl, golden girl
I've got my shit together, oh yeah
Even with a chick, get a grip with hips like this, oh yeah
My golden girl, golden girl
My golden girl, golden girl

[Verse 2: Andre Merritt & Chris Brown]
Freeze, you ain't ever had a girl like me
If you think that I'm lying test me
And you'll see
That I'm down and I aim to please
I'm gonna show you how to break it down
Giving all of my loving to you
So don't be star stuck

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't be star struck
When we going under these covers
You can have the key to my hand cuffs
Man up, boy, just play along
I'll give it to you proper
Play nurse and you play doctor
Boy, you know I got ya
I know what you like

[Chorus: Andre Merritt & Chris Brown]
You like the way I shine, oh yeah
And I'm 10 times part of a dime , oh yeah
I'm your golden girl, golden girl
Your golden girl, golden girl
I've got my shit together, oh yeah
Even with a chick, get a grip with hips like this, oh yeah
My golden girl, golden girl
My golden girl, golden girl
You like the way I shine, oh yeah
And I'm 10 times part of a dime , oh yeah
I'm your golden girl, golden girl
Your golden girl, golden girl
I've got my shit together, oh yeah
Even with a chick, get a grip with hips like this, oh yeah
My golden girl, golden girl
My golden girl, golden girl

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
