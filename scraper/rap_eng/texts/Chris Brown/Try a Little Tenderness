Oh, she may be weary
Them young girls, they do get weary
Wearing that same old shaggy dress, oh yeah
Oh, when she gets weary, try a little tenderness, oh yes, oh yes, oh
You know she's waiting, oh, just anticipating, oh
For the things she'll never posses, oh no no no, woah
While she's there waiting there without them
Try oh just a little, oh just a little little little tenderness
That's what I said, a little tenderness
Ha, oh na na na na na na
It's all you gotta do
It's not, ha, ooh just sentimental, no
She has, she has, she has
Her griefs and cares, oh woah
But the soft words, they spoke so gentle, yeah
And it makes it easier, easier to bare
You won't regret it no
Them young girls, they don't forget it
Love is their own, their own, happiness, oh, oh, woah
But it's all, it's all, so simple now

All you gotta do is try a little tenderness, oh, yeah
Won't you show her won't her, won't you show her that you love her, hey
You wanna squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
You gotta, won't you, won't you try, just try a little tenderness, hey, ha
You gotta show her that you want it, now one above her now
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
Hold her, grab her softly now
And try a little tenderness, hey
You oughta listen to me, don't leave, ha
Don't cheat her now
Squeeze her, don't cheat her, never leave her
Gotta show her na na na hey, hey, yeah, hey
Hey, hey
You got to know what to do, don't be a fool
You need to try this now
Just try a little tenderness
Take it from me you don't wanna let her leave, oh now
Squeeze her, don't tease, never leave
You gotta, won't you try
Just try, just try, a little tenderness, ha
Is there a witness in the building tonight? Hey, hey, ha
You gotta, won't you, won't you try, just try a little tenderness
Say it with me, say it with me
Try a little tender, tender, tenderness
You wanna squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
Hold her, grab her softly now

Won't you just, just try?
