[Intro]
Don’t you know, don’t you know?

[Chorus]
Everywhere everywhere, everywhere I go
Everywhere that I've been the only thing I see is
Is beautiful people, beautiful people
Beautiful people, beautiful people
Don’t you know, don’t you know?
You’re beautiful, don’t you know?
Don’t you know, don’t you know?
Beautiful, don’t you know, know, know?
Beautiful, don’t you know?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Everywhere everywhere, everywhere I go
Everywhere that I've been the only thing I see is
Is beautiful people, beautiful people
Beautiful people, beautiful people
Don’t you know, don’t you know?
You’re beautiful, don’t you know?
Don’t you know, don’t you know?
Beautiful, don’t you know, know, know?

[Outro]
Know, know, know...
