[Intro]
Baby that belongs to me, that belongs to me

[Chorus]
Baby this is my pussy, I'mma fuck when I want to
Fuck when I want to, fuck when I want to
It's looking like that, girl you know that I want to
Know that I want to, know that I want to
The way the dancing on me, girl you got me horny
You got me ready to put this hurricane on you
Baby this is my pussy, I'mma fuck when I want to
Fuck when I want to, fuck when I want to

[Verse 1]
We ain't got no worries cause we home alone
We can do that freak shit nobody knows
Girl doggy style, missionary, I don't care
As long as you keep me up and take me there
In the middle of the night
Or the middle of the day
It don't matter cause you know
I'm gon' get it anyway

[Chorus]
Baby this is my pussy, I'mma fuck when I want to
Fuck when I want to, fuck when I want to
It's looking like that, girl you know that I want to
Know that I want to, know that I want to
The way the dancing on me, girl you got me horny
You got me ready to put this hurricane on you
Baby this is my pussy, I'mma fuck when I want to
Fuck when I want to, fuck when I want to

[Verse 2]
Just take it off, I wanna see your body
Just freak me and we'll start the foreplay
Baby lay it down on the bed
And I'mma hit it so good, you won't forget
Got you screaming out loud "This is your shit"
Do it for me, I don't need no molly
In the middle of the night or the middle of the day
It don't matter cause you know I'm gon' get it anyway

[Chorus]
Baby this is my pussy, I'mma fuck when I want to
Fuck when I want to, fuck when I want to
It's looking like that, girl you know that I want to
Know that I want to, know that I want to
The way the dancing on me, girl you got me horny
You got me ready to put this hurricane on you
Baby this is my pussy, I'mma fuck when I want to
Fuck when I want to, fuck when I want to
Baby this is my pussy, I'mma fuck when I want to
Fuck when I want to, fuck when I want to
It's looking like that, girl you know that I want to
Know that I want to, know that I want to

[Outro]
Baby I know that you on too
I can see it in your eyes that you want to
We can do it all night, all day
And I just wanna play with you baby, all night
I just wanna play with you baby, I just
I just wanna, I just wanna play with you baby
