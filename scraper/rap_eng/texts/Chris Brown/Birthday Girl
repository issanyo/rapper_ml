[Verse 1]
I love girls, that will never run away with me
Girls, they wouldn't spend a day with me
Oh, you could say that, you could say that
I’m hopeless, I'm hopeless
I love girls that will never end up with me
Girls, the ones I only see in my dreams
So, you could say that, you could say that
I love her, ooh, ooh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Make this the night of your life, life, life
You can dance if you want, make it feel alright
Oh, temperature's rising, you feel the fire
Let’s make a toast and celebrate
To all my ladies in here (Ow!)
This is dedicated to you (Ow! Ow!)
Girl, today is your day
This all about you (Ow!)
And baby, tonight you're all mine

[Bridge]
I think about her in the morning when I wake up
Never wears make-up, she don't need to fake that
She be on me, I be on her like a first date
Every single hour, wanna treat her like her birthday

[Chorus]
Every single hour wanna treat her like her birthday
Every single hour wanna treat her like her birthday
Yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Birthday girl, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Birthday girl, birthday girl, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Got a girl, now she wanna do a date with me
So this must be my prophecy, yeah
You could say that, you could say that
I know this, one two, three, oh!

[Pre-Chorus]
Make this the night of your life, life, life
You can dance if you want, make it feel alright
Oh, temperature's rising, you feel the fire
Let's make a toast and celebrate
To all my ladies in here
This is dedicated to you
Girl, today is your day (Ow!)
This all about you (Ow!)
And baby, tonight you're all mine

[Bridge]
I think about her in the morning when I wake up
Never wears make-up, she don't need to fake that
She be on me, I be on her like a first date
Every single hour, wanna treat her like her birthday

[Chorus]
Every single hour wanna treat her like her birthday
Every single hour wanna treat her like her birthday
Yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  (I love my birthday girl)
Birthday girl, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (I love, l-l-l-love)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Birthday girl, birthday girl, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Move your body and clap your hands
Move your body and clap your hands, birthday girl, birthday girl
Move your body and clap your hands, birthday girl, birthday girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
