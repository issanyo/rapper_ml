[Intro: DJ Khaled & Chris Brown]
Skye, you a special one
The one
CB, yeah, another one

[Verse 1: Skye & Chris Brown]
I know you love me but I heard about you (heard about you)
They say you ain't good for me (so what?)
I don't care 'cause it ain't true
If they're just stories (yeah), I'd rather see for myself
I guess I'm the only one that still believes in
Fairytales

[Chorus: Skye & Chris Brown]
Feel like the only one
Is this a dream or a fairytale?
Am I the only one, only one?
I don't wanna be the one you dream about
Only once in a while
You're the type a girl I need to keep around me
I tell myself, yeah, yeah
Every night, I don't wanna be the one you dream without
I want you by my side
When I see you we go up every time
I mean everytime (everytime)
I guess I'm the only one that still believes in fairytales

[Verse 2: Skye & Chris Brown]
Adam ate the apple
Eve gave it to him
Still chasing the apple
I know what you're doing
Now, let me tell you something
No, let me tell you
If I let you squeeze the apple, we gon' make juice (ayy)
'Cause baby, when a real bitch want you
She could give a fuck 'bout rumors
Why would I believe the lies?
I can see you with my own eyes
You're like a fairytale

[Chorus: Skye & Chris Brown]
Feel like the only one (feels like the one)
Is this a dream or a fairytale? (woah, oh, oh)
Am I the only one, only one? (Woah, ooh, ah)
I don't wanna be the one you dream about
Only once in a while
You're the type a girl I need to keep around me
I tell myself, yeah, yeah
Every night, I don't wanna be the one you dream without
I want you by my side
When I see you we go up every time
I mean every time (every time)
I guess I'm the only one that still believes in fairytales

[Outro: Skye & Chris Brown]
Hey, hey
Listen
This is for my girls
Lemme tell you about a certain someone, ooh, yeah
Said it wasn't fake
I guess I'm the only one that still believes in
Fairytales
