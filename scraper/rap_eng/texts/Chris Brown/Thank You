[Intro]
Man y'all don't know what y'all do for me, you see without y'all
None of this would matter, I mean none of it so I say thank you, listen

[Verse 1]
Out the gate I got it started off right, Daddy told me "You ain't gotta beat around the bush"
Deep inside I feel you Lord, I've come this far by faith, blessed me with the voice and gave me that extra push
And dear Momma for the times I acted foolish, you popped me with the rulers
I didn't understand but I do now, it's out of love for you Christopher

[Chorus]
I just wanna thank you, you're more than just a friend
With me 'til the end, it's not official without a thank you
I thank you Lord, I praise you Lord
I'm nothing without you
I just wanna thank you Lord
From my heart right to my soul, my CD to my show
You make a difference that's why I thank you
I owe it all to you, I just wanna

[Verse 2]
I just wanna say thanks with all do respect
There's some people I can't forget, as I grow
I'mma definitetly do my best to reach out to the kids, homies on the block, citizens
Hustlers on lock, what it is, the music bizz won't stop or change me
East coast I wanna thank you, west coast I wanna thank you
I owe it all to you, I owe it all to you
Dirty South I wanna thank you, Midwest
So yo cuse I just wanna thank all y'all, yay yay

[Chorus]
I just wanna thank you, you're more than just a friend
With me 'til the end, it's not official without a thank you
I thank you Lord, I praise you Lord
I'm nothing without you
I just wanna thank you, oh yeah
And Jesus, and Jesus, what a friend I have
Thank you, oh
Oh, I just wanna, I just wanna say thanks

[Bridge]
When the song is over, it ain't the end, I'm coming back to you to do it again, I'm loyal to the game so we're gonna win
Yeah I would like to thank y'all tonight for coming out, I love you ladies for chilling with me, all my fans
I love y'all, all them haters I love y'all too cause y'all making me do it more
My family especially my mom I love y'all, but last but not least God

[Chorus]
Cause I just wanna thank you, you're more than just a friend
With me 'til the end, it's not official without a thank you
To my ladies and my fellas
Aw they kept it real with Chris Brown
I just wanna thank you, thank you baby, you know who you are
When I'm on the road, stay committed
Thank you, oh, I just wanna say thanks for you
You've been there for me when nobody was
I gave you praise, thank you, you mean so much to me
I wouldn't know what to do
From my heart right to my soul, my CD to my show
You make a difference that's why I thank you, I love y'all, I just wanna say thanks
