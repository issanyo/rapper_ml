[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, y'all think we playin'?
It's The Conglomerate
Chris Breezy, Bussa Buss, Lonny B get 'em

[Verse 1: Lonny Bereal]
Calling me at 4 up in the morning
Just got out the club, I know you tipsy and you want it
Saying everything you wanna hear, I got you moaning
Sounds like you want the after hours at my home

[Pre-Chorus: Lonny Bereal]
And my doors are open too
You and your girls, if you turned on like that
But all I really need is you
'Cause you've got me turned up like that
Don't be tryna front like you don't want it
I know all the women love telling us, "Not tonight"
But you wanted something when you called me
If you really wanna talk come over

[Chorus: Lonny Bereal & (Busta Rhymes)]
If you really wanna come through
Tell me, baby, lemme send the driver for you
But you gotta know exactly what you wanna do
If you don't wanna give it to me, baby, I'm cool
If you wanna have the time of your life
Then get on over here and baby, spend one night
I know what you want and what you like
And you already know what I wanna do
So baby, don't play with it
Don't play with it
Don't play with it
Don't play with it
Baby, don't play with it
Don't play with it
Don't play with it
Don't play with it
(Chris Brown, where you at?)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
If you want it, you should get it, don't play with your feelings
Don't wait for it, not another second or a minute
If I want it then I got it, I ain't ever had a problem
If you really wanna holla, take my hand and follow me

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
My doors are open too
You and your girls, if you turned on like that
But all I really need is you
'Cause you've got me turned up like that
Don't be tryna front like you don't want it
I know all the women love telling us, "Not tonight"
But you wanted something when you called me
If you really wanna talk come over

[Chorus: Lonny Bereal & (Busta Rhymes)]
If you really wanna come through
Tell me, baby, lemme send the driver for you
But you gotta know exactly what you wanna do
If you don't wanna give it to me, baby, I'm cool
If you wanna have the time of your life
Then get on over here and baby, spend one night
I know what you want and what you like
And you already know what I wanna do
So baby, don't play with it
Don't play with it
Don't play with it
Don't play with it
Baby, don't play with it
Don't play with it
Don't play with it
Don't play with it
(Ayo Lonny, you know we ain't takin' no prisoners, homie)

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, Busta Buss, baby, I revive 'em after killin' 'em (uh-huh)
Blindin' with my incredibly, shinin' is the minimum (uh-huh)
Spendin' money on every bottle and we spillin' 'em
And say the type of shit that'll make me wonder is he really hearin' 'em?
Yup, mami go ahead and a flip and a somersault
Comin' back to my lil' crib and ya better believe them clothes is comin' off
Kissin' all up on the thing and you see your lipstick slowly rubbin' off (ooh)
You kiss it like you really really love it, then you showin' off
Yes, you get to focusin' with every lick (uh-huh)
Then you watch it swell and get to chokin' up a lil' bit
Yeah, I understand, you seein' something that you've never saw
If you scared what you even playin' wit this nigga fo'?
If you show him that you like him then he'll like you back
Don't know what you doin' and you bite him he gon' bite you back
Just like how I bite the track, now they say they scared of us
Beware of us, we ain't playin' games, girl, we serious

[Chorus: Lonny Bereal]
If you really wanna come through
Tell me, baby, lemme send the driver for you
But you gotta know exactly what you wanna do
If you don't wanna give it to me, baby, I'm cool
If you wanna have the time of your life
Then get on over here and baby, spend one night
I know what you want and what you like
And you already know what I wanna do
So baby, don't play with it
Don't play with it
Don't play with it
Don't play with it
Baby, don't play with it
Don't play with it
Don't play with it
Don't play with it
