[Verse 1: Lyrica Anderson]
He told me he don't like to party, party
I told him, "Pull up to the lobby" (Yeah)
Yeah, I just wanna catch a vibe, catch a vibe with you (Vibe)
Valet pulling up outside, come ride with me (Come on)
Just a little conversation, you know what's up (Yeah)
Keep doing things you do, never change up (Woah)
And we do the things that we do, keep it on the low, yeah (Yeah)
And you don't need to hit me up, stay on call, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Lyrica Anderson]
You ain't never gotta ask, for you I just do it (Yeah)
You're one of a kind and I ain't never tryna lose you (Yeah)

It's all me, yeah, it's all me

[Chorus: Lyrica Anderson & w/ Chris Brown]
He gon' pull up on me, wine and dine, it's all me
Put her in some Balmain designer, it's all me

Hit me when you want it, baby (Want it), call me
