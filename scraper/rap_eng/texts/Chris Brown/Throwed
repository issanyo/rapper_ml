[Intro]
Yeah, you know being from Virginia
Haha, I gotta go back to my roots
The whole go go thing, DC what's up? Ha
Virginia, y'all you know how we 'bout to do it, ha, let's go, yessir

[Verse 1]
Been sitting here for an hour talking but we ain't saying nothing
I ain't even tripping mama that's cool, no better way to waste time than with you
Ain't that a trip cause usually I do my thing and I dip, oh
But she got me wanna stick around for the second show, have her do her thang on the stage for me once more

[Chorus]
And I'm like oh
I can't wait for us to be alone, tell me
So tell me, tell me what you say ma
We've been keeping it 100 up to this far
So what you wanna do?
I'm tryna give it but I'm losing my cool for you cause shorty got me throwed
Thrown off, little mama, she got thrown, ay
Thrown off, little mama, she got thrown, ay

[Verse 2]
Now I can't say all the things I wanna say but that body is a problem for me
And I put shame on a man that walked away but I'm glad he left you here for me, yeah
That's real cause usually I can't express how I feel, yeah
It's like I'm in my favourite scene on the movie screen, diamond studded tee, crown holding my Spike Lee's

[Chorus]
And I'm like woah
I can't wait for us to be alone, tell me
So tell me, tell me what you say ma
We've been keeping it 100 up to this far
So what you wanna do?
I'm tryna give it but I'm losing my cool for you cause shorty got me throwed
Thrown off, little mama, she got thrown, ay
Thrown off, little mama, she got thrown, ay

[Bridge]
Girl you got that knock, I hear it down the block
And if I get a chance, guaranteed I keep it hot
I gotta get you locked, so baby pick you feet up
Adjust my two seater, holla if you hear me now
Girl you got that knock, I hear it down the block
And if I get a chance, guaranteed I keep it hot
I gotta get you locked, so baby pick you feet up
Adjust my two seater, holla if you hear me now

[Chorus]
And I'm like oh
I can't wait for us to be alone, tell me
So tell me, tell me what you say ma
We've been keeping it 100 up to this far
So what you wanna do?
I'm tryna give it but I'm losing my cool for you cause shorty got me throwed
Thrown off, little mama, she got thrown, ay
Thrown off, little mama, she got thrown, ay

[Outro]
Yessir, haha, two up, two down
Holla at me, it's all about you
We out, let's go
Got me feeling like hey hey hey hey hey
