[Verse 1]
Hey baby
I don’t like the way you got me feeling lately, oh
They say baby
I'm feeling like you found someone to replace me, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember, you used to say that you would never walk away?
Cause I remember the time and the place like it was just yesterday, oh
Baby you had me gone, gone, gone, but you won't have me, I'm gone, gone, gone
Say no more cause I know what you came for, just wanna play them games, girl

[Chorus]
Cause it's so hard to be let down
Tell me you won't do this to me
We've come too far to give up now
Girl, that's just the way it should be
Say with me babe, say with me
Say with me babe, say with me
Say with me babe, say with me
Say with me baby

[Verse 2]
Hey baby, know you crazy but you ain't that crazy about me
Cause you think that you can get whatever you want
So you lie and you try to blame me
Say lady, you’re cold, you’re poison to me and I know

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember, you used to say that you would never walk away?
Cause I remember the time and the place like it was just yesterday, oh
Baby you had me gone, gone, gone, but you won't have me, I'm gone, gone, gone
Say no more cause I know what you came for, just wanna play them games, girl

[Chorus]
Cause it's so hard to be let down
Tell me you won't do this to me
We've come too far to give up now
Girl, that's just the way it should be
Say with me babe, say with me
Say with me babe, say with me
Say with me babe, say with me
Say with me baby

[Outro]
Hey baby, please don’t take my love away
Tell the DJ keep this party going, hooray hooray
Hey baby, please don't take my love away
Tell the DJ keep this party rocking, hooray hooray
