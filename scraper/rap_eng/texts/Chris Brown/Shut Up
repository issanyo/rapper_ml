[Intro: Problem]
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
All that talkin' ain't making no bread

[Verse 1: Berner]
You ain't got no money, bitch shut up
I'm in the nightclub rollin' bud up
She wants me to fuck without a rubber
Man, she got three kids and she wants to have another
Not me, a no way
I need a dime piece bitch that pay
Ros√©, no thanks
I'm on this Ace and this cold Bombay
Bitch, this gold chain weigh a little more than 16 zippers
Freshko hoodie, LV slippers
All this molly and all these strippers
Let me smoke my joint and keep that swisher
Coke flipper, I fuck a gold digger
I'm a Bay boy, baby, yeah, a real go getter
Someone better tell this bitch shut up
'Cause talkin' like that'll get her boyfriend cut up

[Hook: Problem]
Shut up, shut up, all that talkin' ain't making no bread
Feeling myself, so it ain't no fuckin' if you ain't giving head
So tell that bitch shut up, tell that nigga shut up
Tell that bitch shut up, tell that nigga shut up
All that yappin', ain't no action
Get it crackin' if you tryna make it happen, bitch shut up

[Verse 2: Problem]
Wearin' leggings with no ass
That's like going to the mall with no cash
So like, switch it up
Check how a nigga drop it, now pick it up
Pick it up, dig it up, do your thin,g bitch
Go against us, it's fuck you, who you came with
Club be the big spot, ain't talkin' stains, bitch
Bottle poppin', fire toppin', lightin' up the chain, bitch
Money talk is the language, understand me?
You better listen when I talk, like a granny
Baby's pants goin' down, no hand me
Mark niggas actin' pussy with a dick, hella tranny
Fans love to fan me, fans love to fan me
Niggas jump ship we got for Heat, no Miami
Diamond Lane the family, problem's the name
Licky licky licky, now she glad that she came, can you sucka niggas please?

[Hook: Problem]
Shut up, shut up, all that talkin' ain't making no bread
Feeling myself, so it ain't no fuckin' if you ain't giving head
So tell that bitch shut up, tell that nigga shut up
Tell that bitch shut up, tell that nigga shut up
All that yappin', ain't no action
Get it crackin' if you tryna make it happen, bitch shut up

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Shut up, money too long
Lookin' for a doodoo momma that I can just poop on
Weed too strong, I'm tryna get that pussy
When you talkin' to a don, don't be talkin' too long
Mouth closed, don't speak
Stuntin' on the bitch, gold teeth
Pop molly, no sleep
She been goin' hard like four weeks
I steal hoes, 35 mil hoes
Said she wanna kick it, all good like a field goal
25k that's a earlobe
25 mil in a year though
My money on another level
I don't buy my girl shoes, bought my bitch a pedal
Vroom vroom, that Ferrari just match the Stilletos
And if she just wanna eat some pussy, I'ma let her, yikes

[Hook: Problem]
Shut up, shut up, all that talkin' ain't making no bread
Feeling myself, so it ain't no fuckin' if you ain't giving head
So tell that bitch shut up, tell that nigga shut up
Tell that bitch shut up, tell that nigga shut up
All that yappin', ain't no action
Get it crackin' if you tryna make it happen, bitch shut up
