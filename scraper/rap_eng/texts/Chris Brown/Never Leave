[Verse 1: Jessica]
Baby, would you tell me if you made a mistake?
Would you keep it real, tell it to my face?
Or would you lie and try to cover it up?
Knowing if I found out, I'll leave you in the dust?

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Baby, what would you do if I got in trouble and went away?
Would you stay true?
Would you stick around or do another dude?
I'm curious to know, I need your love

[Verse 3: Jessica & Chris Brown]
Our love is deep like a river, better than an ocean
Boy, you can't even imagine
If I'm getting what I wanted, what I need
I'll never
Girl, you shouldn't say never
I'm saying that I'll never leave

[Chorus: Jessica & Chris Brown]
I'll never leave you, boy
'Cause once I'm done, I'm done, I ride
You got your answer, what's your reply?
I'll never leave, I'll never leave
I'll never leave you, girl
I never say never or always and forever
But you got me wanting the same
I'll never

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
Girl, if I went from a Benz to a making minimum wage
And I couldn't buy you Louis
I couldn't get ya nice thangs
Would you be a no show if I had no clothes?

[Verse 5: Jessica & Chris Brown]
First of all I got my own things
Well baby, things can be replaced
But I can't get enough of you, no you can't, girl
In other words, I'm telling you that I'll never leave

[Chorus: Jessica & Chris Brown]
I'll never leave you, boy
'Cause once I'm done, I'm done, I ride
You got your answer, what's your reply?
I'll never leave, I'll never leave
I'll never leave you, girl
I never say never or always and forever
But you got me wanting the same
I'll never

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Jessica]
Forever, is a long time
For you to be giving me
I'll give everything like this, baby
You'll be rolling with it, I'ma roll with it, girl
Forever is a long time
For you to be giving me your words
Saying you won't ever hurt me
So if we're rolling then let's roll then, let's go

[Chorus: Jessica & Chris Brown]
I'll never leave you, boy
'Cause once I'm done, I'm done, I ride
You got your answer, what's your reply?
I'll never leave, I'll never leave
I'll never leave you, girl
I never say never or always and forever
But you got me wanting the same
I'll never
I'll never leave you, boy
'Cause once I'm done, I'm done, I ride
You got your answer, what's your reply?
I'll never leave, I'll never leave
I'll never leave you, girl
I never say never or always and forever
But you got me wanting the same
I'll never

[Outro: Chris Brown & Jessica]
I'll never
I'll never
