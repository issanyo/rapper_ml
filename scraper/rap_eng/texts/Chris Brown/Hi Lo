[Intro]
Ooh yeah

[Chorus]
I'm getting high, while she take it low
I might throw that cash on the floor
I'm getting high, while she take it low
I'm getting high, while she take it low, low

[Verse 1]
I might throw some cash on that ass
I'ma do my dance for the fuck of it, fuck of it
2 hunnid horses on the dash (aw yeah)
You bring all your freaks, I might hit all of it, all of it
Grind for a second, throw a stack, and bring it back
Once I throw the money on the kitty, it's a rap
Yeah, wind, baby, the way you show me, you can handle that
Dancing like we fucking, you know I fuck with that, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah, no clothes
No pressure, sex, yeah
What I need right now, your legs spread
Let me in right now, yeah

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm getting high, while she take it low (take it low)
I might throw that cash on the floor
I'm getting high, while she take it low (take it low)
I'm getting high, while she take it low, low
High, while she take it low
I might throw that cash on the floor
I'm getting high, while she take it low (take it low)
I'm getting high, while she take it low, low

[Verse 2]
I’ma make these other niggas mad (yeah, that's right)
And I’ma spend my money for the hell of it, hell of it
Baby, please, the way you do that
Girl, if I open up your closet, gon' see some skeletons, skeletons
Mind in pieces, need a bandage let me see it (yeah, yeah)
Show me what you got, you better fuck me like you mean it
Holding your heart, like it's the pledge of allegiance
I say hurry up, get that pole, she taking knees for a reason (yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah, no clothes
No pressure, sex, yeah
What I need right now, your legs spread
Can I eat that pussy now?

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm getting high, while she take it low (low, yeah)
I might throw that cash on the floor
I'm getting high, while she take it low
I'm getting high, while she take it low, low
High, while she take it low (she take it low)
I might throw that cash on the floor (I might throw that cash on the floor)
I'm getting high, while she take it low (high)
I'm getting high, while she take it low, low

[Verse 3]
I’ma roll up that backwoods, while you shake your booty
Drop that ass, to the music, let a major do it
I’ma throw this money in the air but I don’t pay for pussy
It's automatic, that pussy drippin', check the fluid
Making it rain (pussy grind on me)
Have a shower on me, oh woah
Girl, come get it, baby, go crazy
And work me all night, night, go, girl, ayy
Girl, you know you bad, bad, bad, bad
But what you gon’ do with all of that, that, that, that?
Whine up on it, do your dance, dance, dance, dance
This was all a part of the plan

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm getting high, while she take it low
I might throw that cash on the floor
I'm getting high, while she take it low
I'm getting high, while she take it low, low
High, while she take it low
I might throw that cash on the floor
I'm getting high, while she take it low
I'm getting high, while she take it low, low
