Full lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Keep them crappers off me
Niggas talkin' down on my name
Switch sides, nigga, bitch got my dick all on her face
Suicide for these fuck niggas

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
When I'm in my car, all I see is stars, yeah
My own lady bad, let her take the foreign
She'll wear whatever, match my Goyard, yeah
OHB the gang, young and too hard, yeah, yeah
When I'm in my car, all I see is stars, yeah
I just bought a mansion, nigga fuck your apartment
When I'm in my car, all I see is stars, yeah
I ain't come to play, I've come the hard way

[Verse 2: Young Lo]
Pull up in that car, I ain't see no stars in
Blowin' all this cash, I'm like fuck that car shit
I just blew a bag, had a couple new [?]
Traded in that roly, now I'm ballin' like I'm Reagan
Six Lambos parked all in the front
Had to wipe down these six now, put it all in the blunt
Says she wants turn up, told Brown let Molly in the gun
Stop fucking around broke niggas, fuck a real nigga wants

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Switchin' in the middle lane
I was tryin'...

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
When I'm in my car, all I see is stars, yeah
My own lady bad, let her take the foreign
She'll wear whatever, match my Goyard, yeah
OHB the gang, young and too hard, yeah, yeah
When I'm in my car, all I see is stars, yeah
I just bought a mansion, nigga fuck your apartment
When I'm in my car, all I see is stars, yeah
I ain't come to play, I've come the hard way
