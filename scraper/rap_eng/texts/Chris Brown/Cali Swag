[Verse]
Yeah, my swagger's like uh in the DOMINO at that
Shawty send a text, said she feelin' me, lemme forward that
To my other girls, now she say she wanna meet her
A nigga goin' in like a quarter in a meter, so come on
I don't give a damn if she rollin', then I'm rollin'
I ain't talkin' about a pill, but she pop it like she own it
Her continuous moanin', it carries to the mornin'
And Tisha like the steak, so I'm callin' it T-bonin'
My girl got a girlfriend, so you know what it is
I call them daycare 'cause they take care of my kids
Uh, bring the camera out of motion picture
Before you take your clothes off, let me get the liquor
Nigga, I'm ill, oh believe that
Her titties like snowballs, call them ski racks
They be like stop hoggin', ain't no i in team
I tell them, fuck you, nigga, it's on me
What it is? How you doin'? Nice to meet you
My flow is just like bullets, so this beat will be my nina
That chopper go blow, it split you from your feet up
I got your girl wet, floodin' like Katrina
Rather Billy or Bima,F atima of Christina
Milian, I'm a don, I'm gettin' right between her
I'm strip club ballin', throwin' Franklins like Aretha
She said her mouth dry, so I'm guessin' it's the reefer
Whole team gorillas, K-Mac and Jewlz
Cali swag, nigga, I ain't talkin' dougie do
It's reject, nigga, have you breakin' all the rules
Do my cat daddy, check on TMZ, it's breakin' news, uh
My car lot, jackpot
Got these girls cheerin' like a mascot
Boy, you ask that 'cause I'm hot
I'm mad, all you singles neck like an ascot
I'm on the top, hold your hair tip
When they hear the F.A.M.E. drop, they gon' shit a brick
No pun intended, but I recommend it
Fuck your feelings, nigga, I don't care if you offended
