[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yeah, flow stupid, this is how I do it
Maybach flow, nigga, you are in the Buick
Your girl a doodoo momma, so you know I don’t give two shits
Ain't no grey area, I just breed them blue pits

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
Niggas talk tough but they don’t want it though
Confront you to your face and then I’ll tell your man that he a hoe
Bow Wizzle, I'm as real as it get
I'm either gettin' money or bonin' a chick

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Countin' all this money, all these bottles we poppin'
In a club with the models, got so many options
Nigga, talk your shit, yeah, they hate me, they watchin'
They know my flow ill, I be spittin' and hackin', yikes
At 15, the Bentley was just a kid’s dream, now these cuffed links got me speakin' like I'm European
A hundred thousand packed at the show in Manila
Then I'm down in Africa where the kids are the killers
Got a mind of a king but a heart of a gorilla, you can imitate but ain't nobody realer

[Verse 4: Bow Wow]
Yeah, I'm countin' all this money, milli for the Bugatti
And my girl ass thick like Buffy the body
And which one I'ma choose? I think her with the boobs
I keep paper like the kid in elementary school
You know I'm smokin' on the finest, G5 to the islands
I’m too fly, yeah, it’s like I’m on autopilot
Man, stop it, I'm way outta your league, see it'll take a lifetime to spend all this cheese
I got a new bitch for erry'day of the week, suck a nigga off 'til I'm fast asleep

[Verse 5: Chris Brown]
You know them riders is with us, take it back to the hood
Screamin' father forgive us, all my killers, what’s good?
You know my flow is like murder, gon' give me a sentence, got too many bars, you think I'm buildin' a prison
Anythin' that I sing is a hit car collision, how you got all that mouth and your heart is missin'?

[Verse 6: Bow Wow]
Stop playin' with me, y’all lames to me, me and Chris got our weight up
Better get your cake up, like G&C, get your weight up
Must step when I want new cars every month, ain't out front, y'all niggas in a slump
We the hottest doin' it, don't front, better act like you know what’s up
