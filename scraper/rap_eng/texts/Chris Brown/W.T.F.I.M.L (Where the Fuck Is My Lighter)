[Verse 1]
Hold up, hold up, what you saying, babe?
I heard that your love’s only a mile away
Moving slower, why am I wide awake?
All of this pain I'm tryna take away
Don’t bother me, don’t even bother calling
Drinking it tonight, I'm an alcoholic
Now I wanna try
Something new tonight

[Chorus]
Where the fuck is my lighter?
I'm tired of all this shit, I want to light up, throw my drink in the fire
Just let me pass out, I just wanna escape, turn the lights off, I wanna blackout
We are not one and the same, so where the fuck is my lighter?

[Verse 2]
I'ma take off while I can, while I'm runnin' with the flame
In the night time, I'ma come alive
When I'm seein' a crazy face, but none of ‘em look the same
I'ma let go, just wanna let go
Can't hear what you're sayin', while the liquor playin', killin' my brain is suicide
My veins burnin' up, it feels like I'm gon' die
I'll take two shots, fuck it if you watchin', give me the bottle
I'ma down it, I'ma roll up with the Swisher

[Chorus]
Where the fuck is my lighter?
I'm tired of all this shit, I want to light up, throw my drink in the fire
Just let me pass out, I just wanna escape, turn the lights off, I wanna blackout
We are not one and the same, so where the fuck is my lighter?
