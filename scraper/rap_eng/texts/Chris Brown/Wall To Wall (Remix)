(feat. Jay Read)

[Jay Read:]
Make way for Read and Young Breezy
That's 2 hot names bigger than mount Figi
Please believe me these boys got swagg
Like we twisted Dolomite and sqeezed out Shaft
Better yet he's Chris and I'm Jay
This is us ll day in the broad day in a broad way
Wall to Wall got the game on smash
Pump a couple records that'll spin like Taz

[Verse 1:]
Pull up Pull up
Can't believe the girls look packed
What up What up
Shorty wanna lead me to the back (to the back)
Ain't been in here 15 minutes got a pocket full of digits and she just won't break no
Hold up Hold up
Now lil mama wanna get mad
Slow up Slow up
Sayin she don't wanna share what she had (she had)
Ain't no particular one that's getting this boy gone it's many that I want

[Chorus:]
They packed up in here
Wall to wall
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm trynna get one of them, all
But they keep coming from wall to wall They packed up in here
Wall to wall (ooh yeah)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm trynna get one of them, all
But they keep coming from wall to wall

[Verse 2:]
Another 2 just came up and said they love me on the radio (on the radio)
Two twins that's a cool lil scenario (lil scenario)
They talkin leaving right now
Wanna put in some time cause you know what they already bout
One talking
How she like the way that I rock
And the other one
How she wanna just watch (just watch)
I'm game for any damn thing
But there's more than 200 dames
That swear they could go

[Chorus:]
They packed up in here
Wall to wall
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm trynna get one of them, all
But they keep coming from wall to wall They packed up in here
Wall to wall (ooh yeah)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm trynna get one of them, all
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They up in here wall to wall (I can't believe there's so many of them feeling me)
I don't here nothing but ladies calling
I'm trynna get one of them, all
But they keep coming from wall to wall (wall to wall)
They up in here wall to wall
I don't here nothing but ladies calliing (it's so many ladies in here)
I'm trynna get one of them, all
But they keep coming from wall to wall

[Breakdown:]
So many look good in here (so good)
I don't even know which one I want (I want)
If I had to choose ya'll know (you know)
I would take all ya'll with me
Who wanna try me on the floor
Who ready to come and get this (get this)
All I know is that I'm feeling this party
And you can see I'm so ready

[Chorus:]
They packed up in here
Wall to wall

I'm trynna get one of them, all
But they keep coming from wall to wall They up in here
Wall to wall
