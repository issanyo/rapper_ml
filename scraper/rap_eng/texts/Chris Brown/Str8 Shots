[Verse 1]
Get it, touch right there, babe, I ain't scared, I'm down
All I need is one time, one time, for me to go down and eat it like it's lunch time
I'm in a 4 door, Polo, them horses but you roll up in a 4 door, in the mirror, she gorgeous
Bad like, nigga, when you thought that green light, baby, get your head right, follow me to that east side
I fuck with some real niggas, the belly of the beast all day, VA
You know that we all deal wishing, then I pop up the pussy in your face, fillet
At the party, got bank, got that bomb ass sushi, call that ass to the sink
Stop acting like it ain't and that's a violation, 3 seconds in the pain
Oh girl, I really fuck with ya
Girl, I think I'm in love with ya
That one girl, I only seen on my way, yeah
It's a straight shot to the crib, no chaser

[Chorus]
1 2 3, it's a straight shot to the crib
1 2 3, it's a straight shot to the crib
1 2 3, it's a straight shot to the crib
Straight shot to the crib, straight shot to the crib
Take shots, take shots, take shots, we don't waste shots
Take shots, take shots, take shots, to the crib
1 2 3, it's a straight shot to the crib
1 2 3, it's a straight shot to the crib

[Verse 2]
Okay, let me bust on the bullet, automatic, call it pump
Straight shots, call it made shots in the Maybach
Throwin' up the OHB 'cause we out here ballin'
And we still getting paid, buck
I elevate and get rich, VVS flow
Cuttin' through the diamonds like a fuckin' laser
Pow, pow, look at the crowd
Set up on shit, nigga, look at me now
Gon' put it on wax, try to figure me out
Random selectin' the line up, she pickin' me out
It's 'cause I'm a black guy and she a white girl
No, I did not have my dick in her mouth
I'm busy bein' the life of the motherfuckin' party
Private jets, private sex, private departures
The money ain't a thing, I don't care 'bout an offer
But I'm 'bout put the pussy right up in the coffin, let's go

[Chorus]
1 2 3, it's a straight shot to the crib
1 2 3, it's a straight shot to the crib
1 2 3, it's a straight shot to the crib
Straight shot to the crib, straight shot to the crib
Take shots, take shots, take shots, we don't waste shots
Take shots, take shots, take shots, to the crib
1 2 3, it's a straight shot to the crib
1 2 3, it's a straight shot to the crib
