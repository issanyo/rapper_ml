[Verse 1]
You don't love me like you used to (like you used to, like you used to)
You don't touch me like you used to (like you used to, like you used to)
Where did I go wrong? When did I lose focus?
When did you move on? It seems like I never noticed

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been looking for love in all the wrong places (all the wrong places)
And I've been looking for you in other girl's faces, it's time that I face it (in other girl's faces)
I messed up with you
I played the game but I broke all the rules

[Chorus]
I fell out of paradise
And now all I do is cry
It hurts when you fall out of paradise
It cuts me just like a knife
Got me all of out place and it don't feel right
Got lost in the sauce
And now I'm paying the price
I fell out of paradise

[Verse 2]
You giving all my love to a stranger, no, no
But you know that's not how it's 'posed to go
You changing on me, oh, when did your heart turn cold?
When did our love get old? (Old)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've been looking for love in all the wrong places (ooh, babe)
And I've been looking for you in other girl's faces, it's time that I face it
I messed up with you
I played the game but I broke all the rules

[Chorus]
I fell out of paradise (I fell out of paradise)
And now all I do is cry (and now all I do is cry)
It hurts when you fall out of paradise (fall out of paradise)
It cuts me just like a knife (it cuts me just like a knife)
Got me all of out place and it don't feel right (don't feel right)
Got lost in the sun
And now I'm paying the price
I fell out of paradise

[Verse 3]
Huh, yeah, we fell off, you moved on, I'm tryna play it off (yeah, yeah)
I send that text, you decline my message, press and ignore (oh)
Take you from Michael Kors to cameras recording you (oh)
Now I made you famous, couldn't stop it if I wanted to (yeah)
Damn, it's the honest truth, I need my bitch a hunnid proof (yeah, hey)
Forget about the past, girl, let's call a truce (yeah)
And I didn't wanna put no pain on you
I didn't want my heart to stain on you (yeah, yeah)
Falling out of paradise
And I feel like you're holding my all and outta sight

[Chorus]
I fell out of paradise (oh)
And now all I do is cry, (cry)
It hurts when you fall out of paradise (fall, fall)
It cuts me just like a knife (ooh, oh)
Got me all of out place and it don't feel right (oh, woah)
Got lost in the sun (hey)
And now I'm paying the price (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I fell out of paradise
