[Verse 1]
From the moment I saw you, I stopped everything 'cause nothing else mattered
'Cause I had to have you and I knew I couldn't get nothing better
It felt like destiny or Cupid, shot me with an arrow through my heart
When you're next to me, I'm stupid in love

[Pre-Chorus]
And your body's telling me something
And we be sweating making love, bed bumping
Ooh, I hear you screaming
You're yelling, "Give it to me daddy, I need it," girl, you

[Chorus]
You made me change, got me thinking 'bout giving you this ring, girl
It might seem strange but I love the way you make me feel when you sexing
We can do it on a plane, even outside in the cold, in the rain, girl
When we're loving, I need a second serving, of you

[Verse 2]
Ooh, your lips I taste and I'ma slide my hands down to your waist
Damn, I wish I could keep you prisoner for just a day
Got me thinking, could you have my kids? Big house and a dog, you my wife
I'm about to go all out, take it all off 'cause it's going down tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And your body's telling me something
And we be sweating making love, bed bumping
Ooh, I hear you screaming
You're yelling, "Give it to me daddy, I need it," girl, you, well you know the rest

[Chorus]
You made me change, got me thinking 'bout giving you this ring, girl
It might seem strange but I love the way you make me feel when you sexing
We can do it on a plane, even outside in the cold, in the rain, girl
When we're loving, I need a second serving, of you

[Bridge]
Take my hand, lemme put this ring on your finger
I'm your man, girl, you got an R&B singer
And it's a party, party
Yeah, it's a party, girl, you make me

[Chorus]
You made me change, got me thinking 'bout giving you this ring, girl
It might seem strange but I love the way you make me feel when you sexing
We can do it on a plane, even outside in the cold, in the rain, girl
When we're loving, I need a second serving, of you

[Outro]
I need a second serving tonight babe
I need a second serving tonight babe
