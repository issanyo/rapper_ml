[Intro: Chris Brown]
Oh I know, na na na
You see who's real

[Hook: Chris Brown & Boosie Badazz]
Oh girl
I been looking for somebody who gon' hold me down in this cold world
Where you girl? Oh
Oh girl, she don't love me like she say she do
Oh girl, she don't love me like she say she do
Oh girl, she don't love me like she say she do
Oh girl, if she did then why she say she do?
Oh, she don't love me like she say she do
Oh, she don't love me like she say she do
Oh, she don't love me like she say she do
She don't do the shit she say she do

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Boosie Badazz]
Monday, she actin' like she don't really miss me
Tuesday, I feel a difference in her kisses
Wednesday, we sex, we argue when we finish
Thursday she trippin', club all night Friday
Stand by me, Whitney and Bobby, be my rock, girl
Paparazzi, no freedom but at the house, girl
And baby, I don't wanna leave ya, baby, I don't wanna leave
But baby, I don't really need ya either
Front of Harlem, scared to love
Perfect career, perfect face and that ass, ooh I'm scared of her
Got too much to lose doin' you but you worth it
If we make it we deserve it

[Hook: Chris Brown & Boosie Badazz]
Oh girl
I been looking for somebody who gon' hold me down in this cold world
Where you girl? Oh
Oh girl, she don't love me like she say she do
Oh girl, she don't love me like she say she do
Oh girl, she don't love me like she say she do
Oh girl, if she did then why she say she do?
Oh, she don't love me like she say she do
Oh, she don't love me like she say she do
Oh, she don't love me like she say she do
She don't do the shit she say she do

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
(Let me tell you 'bout ol' girl)
She say she me ride or die but she barely smile
Went to prison, you actin' different, where you at now?
I need a soldier, someone real, someone to come get me
When all odds against me, I need a Navy Seal
If that you can't do, you don't love me like you say you do
Loyalty and honesty, the only way we make it through
Sometimes, she be sweet as cotton candy
But most time, she look at me like she can't stand me
I need sunshine, a bad chick to make me happy
Sex me keep me laughin', text me somethin' nasty
System against me, the world call me an outcast
So I need a down chick, if you ain't down you down bad

[Hook: Chris Brown & Boosie Badazz]
Oh girl
I been looking for somebody who gon' hold me down in this cold world
Where you girl? Oh
Oh girl, she don't love me like she say she do
Oh girl, she don't love me like she say she do
Oh girl, she don't love me like she say she do
Oh girl, if she did then why she say she do?
Oh, she don't love me like she say she do
Oh, she don't love me like she say she do
Oh, she don't love me like she say she do
She don't do the shit she say she do
