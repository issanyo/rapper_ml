[Intro]
Look we gotta talk, dang I know, I know it's just, it's just
Something I gotta get off my chest aight, yeah, woah, listen

[Verse 1]
Baby come here and sit down, let's talk, I got a lot to say so I guess I'll start by
Saying that I love you, but you know, this thing ain't been no walk in the park for us
I swear it'll only take a minute, you'll understand when I finish, yeah
And I don't wanna see you cry, but I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so

[Pre-Chorus]
How do you let it go? When you, you just don't know?
What's on the other side of the door, when you're walking out, talk about it
Everything I tried to remember to say just went out my head
So I'mma do the best I can to get you to understand cause I know

[Chorus]
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl it's not you, it's me, I kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Girl I know your heart is breaking and a thousand times I found myself asking, "Why? Why?"
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl I never meant to crush your world
And I never thought I would see the day we grew apart and I wanna know

[Pre-Chorus]
How do you let it go? When you, you just don't know?
What's on the other side of the door, when you're walking out, talk about it
Girl I hope you understand what I'm tryna say
We just can't go on pretending that we get along, girl how you not gonna see it?

[Chorus]
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl it's not you, it's me, I kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye

[Bridge]
Listen to your heart, girl you know, we should be apart
Baby I, I just can't do it, I, I just can't do it
Listen to your heart, girl you know we should be apart
Baby I, I just can't do it and sometimes it makes me wanna cry
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Do you hear me crying? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl it's not you, it's me, I kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl it's not you, it's me, I kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye
