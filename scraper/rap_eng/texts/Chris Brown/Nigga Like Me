[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Mo' money mean mo' problems
Give a fuck about you niggas
Mo' models, a hundred bottles
I'm stuntin' on you niggas
We takin' your girl
It's me and my niggas
Go figure, go figure
Got 'em

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
A nigga like me
She really want a nigga like me
A nigga like me
She only want a nigga like me
A nigga like me
Only want a nigga like me
A nigga like me
She said she like a nigga like me

[Verse 1: Siya]
Hol' up, hol' up
She really want a nigga with some deep pockets
She really want a nigga that be stuntin'
She really want a nigga that'll take her to the club
And buy bottle all night just enough for a nigga
You really can't afford her
I ride around in whips, that's a porter
She know I'm gon' spoil her
I'm a hood nigga, and she love it
I came from the bottom but I been getting money
Out the pen though I never leave the club without a chopper
Good luck if a nigga try and rob her
Four chains on, I never touch shit in
Fly ass niggas all the hoes wanna fuck with
I'm higher than heaven
I'm higher than heaven, I'm blowing Jamaica
Loud packs, shawty, I don't never smoke vapors
Start cuffin' that bitch 'fore I take her

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Mo' money mean mo' problems
Give a fuck about you niggas
Mo' models, a hundred bottles
I'm stuntin' on you niggas
We takin' your girl
It's me and my niggas
Go figure, go figure
Got 'em

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
A nigga like me
She really want a nigga like me
A nigga like me
She only want a nigga like me
A nigga like me
Only want a nigga like me
A nigga like me (Look, haha)
She said she like a nigga like me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You fuck around and hate me I'ma take your bitch
Take your chain, nigga, take your shit
I ain't never ever been broke
Fuckin' with amigo, spending those pesos, bitch
Put your hands up, nigga, sit down
I box a nigga with these six rounds
I ain't gotta say two words
But when I pull up to the curb, you motherfuckers just get down
Wanna talk about money? Huh
Nigga look at these hundreds
I could do it by myself, no help
Nigga, who runnin'?
Look, Chuck Taylor's make me run fast
Left hook, click pow, that's a gun jab, huh
And a nigga wanna smile when you layin' down
Silly nigga talkin' shit, now he toe tag

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Mo' money mean mo' problems
Give a fuck about you niggas
Mo' models, a hundred bottles
I'm stuntin' on you niggas
We takin' your girl
It's me and my niggas
Go figure, go figure
Got 'em

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Problem)]
A nigga like me
She really want a nigga like me
A nigga like me
She only want a nigga like me
A nigga like me
Only want a nigga like me (what?)
A nigga like me (shawty, yeah)
She said she like a nigga like me

[Verse 3: Problem]
If you got a hot nine teach us
You motherfuckers sure gon' learn 'bout me
Never low, yeah, I'm always high key
Yo' nine last time nigga uses ID
Al-always real niggas in my background
Fifty deep in the club, no pat downs (yeah)
Lacin' up shoes 'cause we runnin' (we runnin')
And my hoes ain't runnin' for nothin' (what?)
'Cause I am the man (man)
I am the man, I am the man (what?)
Your homie, he ran
You think it's a bed the way I would lie on his stand (what? Woo)
For all of my fam (fam)
I done done it already
I see you love me already
She feel it all in her belly
This money is funny itâ€™s scary
Milk 'em no dairy
Your boy get head bigger than Berry
Come on

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Mo' money mean mo' problems
Give a fuck about you niggas
Mo' models, a hundred bottles
I'm stuntin' on you niggas
We takin' your girl
It's me and my niggas
Go figure, go figure
Got 'em

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
A nigga like me
She really want a nigga like me
A nigga like me
She only want a nigga like me
A nigga like me
Only want a nigga like me
A nigga like me
She said she like a nigga like me
