[Intro: OneInThe4Rest]
That juju, oh, oh yeah

[Chorus: OneInThe4Rest]
Oh (yeah, skrrt), when the spotlight hits you, oh, nah, nah, nah
I need Jiu like Jitsu (yeah), oh, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
When the spotlight hits you (yeah), oh, nah, nah, nah
I need Jiu like Jitsu (woo!)

[Verse 1: OneInThe4Rest]
I need Jiu like Jitsu
I see you in the club, I miss you (woah, yeah)
Every other time I see you (where?)
You be in a dress that's see through
Girl, you know a nigga been balling (skrrt)
And the only shot I miss is you (yeah)
Girl, you know you hear me calling (oh)
Girl, you know you hear me calling you (you)
Girl, won't you say something?
Got me out here waiting
Got me losing all my patience
Got me out here about to break something
Girl, won't you say something?
Got me out here waiting (woo!)
Got me losing all my patience
Got me out here about to break something

[Chorus: OneInThe4Rest & Chris Brown]
You know (skrrt), when the spotlight hits you, oh, nah, nah, nah
I need Jiu like Jitsu (yeah), oh, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
When the spotlight hits you (yeah), oh, nah, nah, nah
I need Jiu like Jitsu (woo!)
Oh, nah, nah, nah (skrrt)
When the spotlight hits you
Oh, nah, nah, nah
I need Jiu like Jitsu (yeah), oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
When the spotlight hits you (yeah), oh, nah, nah, nah
I need Jiu like Jitsu (woo!)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Took them naked pictures, better give me my photo credit (oh, yeah)
Body perfect, but I know you shy
Fuck a filter, you donâ€™t need an edit
Picture perfect for me every time
Let the flashes hit you
Please girl, don't act different
'Cause I'm gonna be right there with you
And you know I'm the type to get ignorant
Girl, won't you say something?
If it's too bright, put your shades on
Red carpet, yo outfit gone slay 'em
Now look at everybody hating
Don't even say nothing
Don't even sweat it, you number one
These bitches ain't even runner-ups
You got me out here about to break something

[Chorus: OneInThe4Rest & Chris Brown]
You know (skrrt), when the spotlight hits you, oh, nah, nah, nah (spotlight hits you)
I need Jiu like Jitsu (yeah), oh, yeah, yeah, yeah (you, you, you)
When the spotlight hits you, oh, nah, nah, nah (get you spotlighted)
I need Jiu like Jitsu (woo!)
Oh, nah, nah, nah
When the spotlight hits you
Oh, nah, nah, nah
I need Jiu like Jitsu, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
When the spotlight hits you, oh, nah, nah, nah
I need Jiu like Jitsu
