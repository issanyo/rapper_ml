[Intro: Remy Ma]
Pretty brown eyes
You know!

[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
I got that up north glow, body lookin' like cinnamon
I'm runnin' shit right now, I think I pulled a ligament
Fashion killer, Ala√Øa assassin
Vetements villain, Balenciaga bastard
Got that melanin magic, brown skin poppin'
Always fly, I stay in a cockpit
I want it, I cop it, opened the door, then locked it
Every time Remy touch the city, stop it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're my pretty brown eyes
They all on ya and they want you
I know they need you in they life
But you my vibe tonight and I love you, oh
Baby, don't try to act like you ain't been texting me
Saying what you wanna know
With them pretty brown thighs
Between your legs tonight is what I wanna do

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
I'm a real writer, rap crown taker
Ass so soft because it's not faker
I can show you how to move in a room full of hoe bitches
He met me and now he don't even know bitches
I see, you be on IG
I'm thick, you sick, damn, you need an IV
Show me your ID 'cause I don't know you chicks
You scared of heights (no?)
Well then jump off my dick

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're my pretty brown eyes
They all on ya and they want you
I know they need you in they life
But you my vibe tonight and I love you, oh
Baby, don't try to act like you ain't been texting me
Saying what you wanna know
With them pretty brown thighs
Between your legs tonight is what I wanna do

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
You know I don't care, bring that ass right here for me
Take it all off for me, baby, lemme see somethin'
I know you the best for me, you're a real winner
Baby girl, you bad as fuck, I'm a real nigga
You know, you know, that I'll always be there for you
Won't let you go, I'll always take care of you
Because you're mine, pretty brown eyes

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're my pretty brown eyes
They all on ya and they want you
I know they need you in they life
But you my vibe tonight and I love you, oh
Baby, don't try to act like you ain't been texting me
Saying what you wanna know
With them pretty brown thighs
Between your legs tonight is what I wanna do
