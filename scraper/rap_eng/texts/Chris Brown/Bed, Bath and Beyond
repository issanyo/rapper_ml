[Intro: J. Valentine & Chris Brown]
Oh, this is for my baby though, this one's for my baby though
Oh, this is for my baby though, this one's for my baby though
Turn it up right now, now, now
Let it bring your body on down, down, down
Turn it up right now, now, now
Let it bring your body on down, down, down

[Verse 1: J. Valentine]
I’m looking at you like you’s a star
'Cause you’re shining in the dark
Go on and tell me every day with her
I'll go there and put in work
Giving you what you deserve

[Pre-Chorus: J. Valentine]
I’ll do everything that I say I would
Make your body feel, like you never could
If you follow me, girl, I swear I won’t lead you on
When we get home

[Chorus: J. Valentine]
I’m gonna lay you down, turn you around
Wanna make love all over this house
Baby, from the bed to the bath and beyond
However you like it
I’ma hit the spot 'til you can’t take no more
Going in, like I never, ever did before
From the bed to the bath and beyond!
However you like it, girl

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I bet you never had a man like me
That’s gon' make your body feel this way
I’ll pull you closer even when you say no
So baby, let me take control now!

[Pre-Chorus: J. Valentine & Chris Brown]
I’ll do everything that I say I would
Make your body feel, like you never could
If you follow me, girl, I swear I won’t lead you on
When we get home

[Chorus: J. Valentine & Chris Brown]
I’m gonna lay you down, turn you around
Wanna make love all over this house
Baby, from the bed to the bath and beyond
However you like it
I’ma hit the spot 'til you can’t take no more
Going in, like I never, ever did before
From the bed to the bath and beyond!
However you like it, girl

[Bridge: J. Valentine & Chris Brown]
I know you tired of laying on the bed
We can stay here on the floor
We don’t need no lingerie
Just put your naked body on
You know I like it when your hair gets wet
Girl, I’m gon' turn this shower on
So let’s reinvent love making
I’ll drive you crazy

[Chorus: J. Valentine & Chris Brown]
I’m gonna lay you down, turn you around
Wanna make love all over this house
Baby, from the bed to the bath and beyond
However you like it
I’ma hit the spot 'til you can’t take no more
Going in, like I never, ever did before
From the bed to the bath and beyond!
However you like it, girl
