[Verse 1]
Is she the same pretty girl that I met in the bar? (Oh, oh, oh, woah)
She took the stage, it was her and her acoustic guitar (oh, oh, oh, woah)
She love the fast life, bad boys and fancy cars
Oh man, this girl got me open, I can’t find where to start
So baby, let me take your hand and then smile
I wish I could say more but this will have to do for now, oh baby

[Chorus]
I gave you just a little bit to make you want more
If you didn’t come to love me, girl, what you come for? (Oh)
I'm just tryna work it out, out, yeah
And baby, I'll make it a mission just to give you all of me
Girl, you’re lying to yourself, you know the truth will set you free, yeah
So baby, come closer, closer to me
