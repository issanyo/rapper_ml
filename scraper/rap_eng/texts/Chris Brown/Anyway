[Chorus: Tayla Parx]
'Cause I'ma love you anyway
'Cause I'ma love you anyway

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I know you probably never had somebody
Loving you like I do, someone that's there for you
Don't judge ya cause I know we only human
I must be stupid babe, letting you slip away

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Tayla Parx]
If you show me all your flaws, I'll show you mine
I'll claim your baggage, no longer need to hide

[Chorus: Tayla Parx & Chris Brown]
'Cause I'ma love you anyway
'Cause I'ma love you anyway
'Cause I'ma love you anyway
'Cause I'ma love you anyway

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I wish that you could see you like I see you
It's not that you're no good, you're just misunderstood
Now it's my job to make you a believer
Them boys ain't like this man, can't love you like I can

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Tayla Parx]
If you show me all your flaws, I'll show you mine
I'll claim your baggage, no longer need to hide

[Chorus: Tayla Parx & Chris Brown]
'Cause I'ma love you anyway
'Cause I'ma love you anyway
'Cause I'ma love you anyway
'Cause I'ma love you anyway

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Lemme get it like
Lemme get it like
Lemme get it like
Lemme get it like

[Chorus: Tayla Parx & Chris Brown]
'Cause I'ma love you anyway
'Cause I'ma love you anyway
'Cause I'ma love you anyway
'Cause I'ma love you anyway
