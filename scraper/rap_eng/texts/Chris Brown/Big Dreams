[Chorus: HoodyBaby]
I just wanna pull up in a Lamborghini
My pops talking shit but I know he seen me
I just wanna pull up in a fucking 'rari
Yeah, I coulda went to college, tell my mom I'm sorry
I just wanna pull up in a Lamborghini
My pops talking shit but I know he seen me
I just wanna pull up in a fucking 'rari
Yeah, I coulda went to college, tell my mom I'm sorry

[Verse 1: HoodyBaby]
Hard times, 4 niggas, 89s
It's going down at 10, hope we make it home, Amen
Riding with the package, open jackers and 'em crackers
Everything complain hoe, family don’t attack us
Everyone’s a suspect, raised with some backstabbers
Stab you in your back, find they bag you for a set
Tony Romo with the 9, out in Dallas, running laps
Hail Mary to LA, baby I can bring you bag
Hood B, Beyoncé, somebody stop me
2 Rollies, 3 APs, watch me
I just wanna pull up with my niggas in the fucking ‘rari
Told my mom, the grind pays so I’m rich regardless

[Chorus: HoodyBaby]
As a young nigga, I had big dreams
Fell in love with the streets, I was 15
Ever since a young nigga, I had big dreams
Fell in love with the cars, I was 15
I just wanna pull up in a Lamborghini
My pops talking shit but I know he seen me
I just wanna pull up in a fucking 'rari
Yeah, I coulda went to college, tell my mom I'm sorry
I just wanna pull up in a Lamborghini
My pops talking shit but I know he seen me
I just wanna pull up in a fucking 'rari
Yeah, I coulda went to college, tell my mom I'm sorry

[Verse 2: Gangsta Robb]
Tell my mom I'm sorry, told my pops I'm thugging
Red 'rari flexing and I'm round with my young'ns
Somebody bring the wrappers cause we just got the plug in
Somebody go and grab the Sprite so I can mix the mud in
Out in public thugging, 20 bricks in traffic
Sipping lean, on my phone, counting money backwards
Coulda went to college but I said, "Fuck the master"
Ask me why I do this nigga cause the money faster

[Chorus: HoodyBaby]
As a young nigga, I had big dreams
Fell in love with the streets, I was 15
Ever since a young nigga, I had big dreams
Fell in love with the cars, I was 15
I just wanna pull up in a Lamborghini
My pops talking shit but I know he seen me
I just wanna pull up in a fucking 'rari
Yeah, I coulda went to college, tell my mom I'm sorry
I just wanna pull up in a Lamborghini
My pops talking shit but I know he seen me
I just wanna pull up in a fucking 'rari
Yeah, I coulda went to college, tell my mom I'm sorry
