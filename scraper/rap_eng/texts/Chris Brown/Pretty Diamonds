[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Woke up to a bag I might just go and splurge today (ayy, what up?)
Called this little baddie up, pulled up on the Ã¡ndale (yeah)
She got the type charisma, make the hardest nigga shy
I said she got the type charisma, make the lamest nigga try (yeah, leggo)
And you know she independent just like that Boosie song (okay, what up?)
When we 'bout to set it off, we like to throw that Boosie on (what up?)
Fuck that girl all on my safe, fuck that girl all in my Wraith (what up? What up?)

The devil wears Prada and she be in that Louis too (uh, hey)
You know her when you see her, she gon' be the coldest in the crew (uh, what's up?) (Oh)
Type to take your heart out and walk on it with red bottoms
Had a whole city talkin' 'bout, I think they ain't got 'em (oh)
She the type to say that she ain't fuckin' on the first night (yeah, please don't)
I'm the type of nigga have her naked at the first light (yeah)
Call me Mr. Delta, yeah I put her on the first flight (oh, woah)
Once I work the left and then I hit her with that first right
I'm in my zone if I say so myself
I played the game with the cards I was dealt (uh, yeah)
Leave out the club then we go get a room
She leave when we done and I'm leavin' at noon
The sexiest thing 'bout her gotta be her confidence
And if I say I want it twice a week, then that's a compliment (yeah, uh)

Oh, you thought that I wasn't man enough
