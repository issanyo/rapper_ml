[Verse 1]
Girl I know we fussing every little thing I say ain't right, nah
You calling me names and I see the pain that's in your eyes
Then we be making love, rolling round then I got my body in between your thighs
Oh baby, I like it when we make love

[Chorus]
Keep it up, keep it going
Cause you're fine and you know it
I love it when you talk that shit (oooh)
I love it when you talk that shit (oooh)
Yell it out, so I can hear it
Cuss me out, make me feel it
I love it when you talk that shit (talk that shit)
I love it when you talk that shit (talk that shit like)

[Verse 2]
God damnit I just like everything you do cause I know you keep me in check
And if a girl try to push up on me, you won't hesitate to grab her by her neck
A little crazy, but you're amazing, you ain't scared to show your bad side
Ooh baby, you're the one I want, the one I love

[Chorus]
Keep it up, keep it going
Cause you're fine and you know it
I love it when you talk that shit (oooh)
I love it when you talk that shit (oooh)
Yell it out, so I can hear it
Cuss me out, make me feel it
I love it when you talk that shit (talk that shit)
I love it when you talk that shit (talk that shit like)

[Bridge]
Tell me shut up, tell me no
You get fed up, I let you throw my phone
Then you tell me to the left, to the left
Then I'm right back for the sex, for the sex
I know you mad now, but later on
Yeah we gon' take it to the room
You can let out all of your aggression
And put it on me like
I hate you, you ain't shit but I love you
Don't nobody else make me mad as you
But when we making love though I'm glad it's you
Ladies sing it, I hate you, you ain't shit but I love you
Don't nobody else make me mad as you but when we making love though I'm glad it's you

[Chorus]
Keep it up, keep it going
Cause you're fine and you know it
I love it when you talk that shit (oooh)
I love it when you talk that shit (oooh)
Yell it out, so I can hear it
Cuss me out, make me feel it
I love it when you talk that shit (talk that shit)
I love it when you talk that shit (talk that shit like)

[Outro]
Baby, yeah, I love it when you're talking shit, oh yeah
