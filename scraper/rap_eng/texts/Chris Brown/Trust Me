[Intro]
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

[Chorus]
Every time I go, they keep telling me no
And life's travelling fast all around you, whispers about my past
I can tell you anything I want
But I'd rather rewrite my wrongs if I'm allowed to
So let me know if you can trust me
If you can trust me, then trust me
If you can trust me baby
If you can trust me, then trust me

[Verse 1]
This your moment baby, I'm just trying not to miss it
You just gotta keep it 100 with all your bitches
Tell 'em that you fucking with a thug who got a pistol
That sip codeine and made a quarter million of a chickens
But you know every boy gotta man up
And what's the point of fucking if we can't love?
I wonder she's right
I know I broke her heart now, now I understand her
I know that she wanna forgive but I know better she'll never forget it
All of the people that's all in her head, wish she could make up her mind with decisions
Already heard that she fucked with a player, told me she never would fuck with a player
Even when I was that nigga in jail, one visitation but never no mail

[Chorus]
Every time I go, they keep telling me no
And life's travelling fast all around you, whispers about my past
I can tell you anything I want
But I'd rather rewrite my wrongs if I'm allowed to
So let me know if you can trust me
If you can trust me, then trust me
If you can trust me baby
If you can trust me, then trust me
