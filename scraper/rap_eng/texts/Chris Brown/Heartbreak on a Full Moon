[Verse 1]
Baby, don't know why
You do it to him
What you do lately, I've been howling
While the crescent's crowning, the crescent's crowning

[Chorus]
Heartbreak on a full moon, oh
It's because of you, because of you, yeah, yeah
Heartbreak on a full moon, oh, full moon, baby
It's because of you, because of you, heartbreak, heartbreak
Heartbreak, oh, heartbreak, oh
Heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak, oh
Heartbreak on a full moon
Heartbreak, yeah

[Verse 2]
Lady, I done told you
Show you spark you lost so
Baby, don't go, stay here, don't go
'Til the sun comes, I need you

[Chorus]
Heartbreak on a full moon, ooh yeah, so right it ain't right
It's because of you, you baby, because of you, you baby, yeah, yeah
Heartbreak on a full moon, oh, full moon, full moon, baby
It's because of you, because of you, because of you, heartbreak
Heartbreak, oh no no, no, oh no no, heartbreak
Oh no no no, oh, oh no no, heartbreak
Heartbreak, oh no no, heartbreak, oh, oh no no
Heartbreak, oh no no, on a full moon, no no no
Heartbreak, yeah

[Bridge]
I'm so faded, yeah
Girl, where did our love go?
Feels like strangers
Is playing on your loving so
Dangerous, ooh yeah
But it just hurts me to hear you say it
Under the moonlight
My heart is breaking, girl

[Chorus]
Heartbreak on a full moon
It's because of you, you baby, because of you, you baby, yeah, yeah
Heartbreak on a full moon, oh, ooh hoo
It's because of you, because of you, because of you, oh woah
Heartbreak, oh, heartbreak
Oh, heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak, oh
Heartbreak on a full moon
Heartbreak
