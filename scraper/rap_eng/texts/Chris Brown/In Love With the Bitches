[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
You envious to all my niggas livin' right
You mad cause we can pop bottles every fuckin' night
Poppin' them pills when we chill, for real
Smokin' straight gas, I'mma see you in another life
Bitch I'm blunted, just look at my eyes, I won't fuckin' lie
Catch a vibe, codeine got me leanin', I'm about to slide
OHB, yeah we ride or die, better pick a side
And when I get that pussy, you gon' blame it on the liquor, right?
When you gon' let a real nigga live?
Cause ain't nothin' for me to call up a side bitch
Girl, let a lightskin nigga get up in them ribs
And you can bring your girls, promise I won't fuck them bitches
Damn, you been frontin' on that all night
I gotta leave, come with me on this red eye
She want relationship and I was willin' to pay that tuition
Fuckin' up her decision but I'm in love with the bitches

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, I've tried but I can't, I've tried
Cause I'm in love with these bitches (Oh, no)
Too drunk, had a threesome
They done caught me on cam and got pictures
And we was drinkin' everythin'
What would a young nigga do if it was you?
Damn they done told everythin'
It's real fucked up but I'm in love with the bitches
(Oh, whoa) Cause I'm in love with these bitches
(Oh, whoa, yeah) Cause I'm in love with these bitches

[Verse 2: Young Lo]
I swear I love all these bitches, especially the freak hoes
Line 'em up and knock 'em down like freethrows
Swear I'm young Will, hit 'em with the steal, leave that pussy killed
Lick that kitty, I should leave a hoe bill
Yeah I'm ballin' on point, like it's a milli in the mattress
Wake up every mornin', different bitches in the mansion
Models gettin' high, throwin' whippets in the attic
My nigga burnt out, got these hoes snortin' aspirin
And we gon' throw a party, take the molly, helpin' for the bottles
Eat that pussy, eat that pussy, call me sloppy papi
Swervin' in the newest foreign, ridin' with the carbon
Poppin' your bitch, nigga, why you even need to call him?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, I've tried but I can't, I've tried
Cause I'm in love with these bitches (Oh, no)
Too drunk, had a threesome
They done caught me on cam and got pictures
And we was drinkin' everythin'
What would a young nigga do if it was you?
Damn they done told everythin'
It's real fucked up but I'm in love with the bitches
(Oh, whoa) Cause I'm in love with these bitches
(Oh, whoa, yeah) Cause I'm in love with these bitches

[Verse 3: Young Blacc]
Let let, let a real nigga hit it
Magnum XL's, only real niggas fitted
Got her walkin' limp cause I gave her the business
Come in to the crib and bust it down with her sister
Slide to the club, 50 deep on that late night
Back to the crib, might eat her cause it's date night
Throwin' bitches texts and tryna give a nigga threesomes
Henny dick goin' so I might as well beast 'em
My niggas be winnin', my side bitches be trippin'
I put that dick in her stomach and then I take 'em to dinner
I'm just playin' to save her, take my strap on the road
I mean what I say cause I love these hoes

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, I've tried but I can't, I've tried
Cause I'm in love with these bitches (Oh, no)
Too drunk, had a threesome
They done caught me on cam and got pictures
And we was drinkin' everythin'
What would a young nigga do if it was you?
Damn they done told everythin'
It's real fucked up but I'm in love with the bitches
(Oh, whoa) Cause I'm in love with these bitches
(Oh, whoa, yeah) Cause I'm in love with these bitches
