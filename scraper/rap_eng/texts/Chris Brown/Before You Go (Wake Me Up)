[Chorus]
Wake me up before you go, ooh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love
Wake me up before you go, ooh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love

[Verse 1]
Oh, I need a jumpstart, use my cable to plug into ya
Gimme a headstart, gonna have me like hallelujah
Even though I'm a man, girl, you making me feel like a baby
I just wanna lay in your arms, take advantage of the moment
'Cause the way you put it down is the definition of a real lady

[Pre-Chorus]
So before I go to work, can I ask you for a favor?

[Chorus]
Wake me up before you go, ooh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love
Wake me up before you go, ooh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love
'Cause your love, your love, your love
Wake me up with some more of your love
'Cause your love, your love, your love
Wake me up with some more of your love

[Verse 2]
Oh I need a back talk, ooh, I need some sex talk
Oh baby girl, you inspire me, give me the reason to keep going
Oh, sweet as a melody, girl you're the lyrics to my song
When you put that lip lock on me I don't think I can control it
I hold on with all my might while you look at me in my eyes
Like a vitamin, you put back my energy and making me stronger, bring out the best of me

[Pre-Chorus]
So before I go to work, can I ask you a favor?

[Chorus]
Wake me up before you go, ooh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love
Wake me up before you go, ooh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love
'Cause your love, your love, your love
Wake me up with some more of your love
'Cause your love, your love, your love
Wake me up with some more of your love
