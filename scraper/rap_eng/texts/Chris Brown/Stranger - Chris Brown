{Verse 1}

No I never thought anyone could pull the rule over my eyes, yeah
But you're not just anyone you're a master of disguise, oh yeah
I swear you put on one hell of a performance
Cause you was just using me to get what you wanted
And I ain't see it coming, no I couldn't see it coming

{Pre chorus}
Cause you had me fooled thinking that you were the one for me
Thinking that you were the one I need, When I'm alone

{Chorus}
I was just I was just loving a stranger, loving a stranger 4x

{Verse 2}
How you feel my heart, if this is how you do me
I told you that I loved you, oh
And that's not something that's a losely

{Pre chorus}
Cause you had me fooled thinking that you were the one for me
Thinking that you were the one I need, When I'm alone

{Chorus}

I was just, I was just loving a stranger 4x

{Bridge}
Maybe it's karma, Maybe it's bad love, maybe it's a coincidence
Maybe I gave you confidence, Maybe
I'll forgive you, Already miss you
But right now I ain't got time for that
No Super Bowl I ain't running back, No
You cross that line when you walk outside when I say goodbye
Victim of your crimes, taking back what's mine, When I cry inside
Wish I could rewind, but I know that I can't take back time
I can't take back time, Can't take back time, Time

{Chorus}

Loving a stranger 5x
