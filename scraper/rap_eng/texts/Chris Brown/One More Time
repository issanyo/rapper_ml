[Verse 1]
It's 1:30 in the morning, you’re blowing up my phone telling me to come over
And you say you really need me to come closer, babe and handle your body
Girl, I'm right here to hold you down, slow it down and speed it up
And girl, I want you to scream, baby, come put your hair down for me

[Chorus]
I know, I know, every time I'm with her, every time I'm with
Every time I'm with her, she gon' break me off
I can’t wait to get her, I can’t wait to get
I know when I get her, I'ma break her off
I just can’t wait for you
So baby, please I need it more and more
Baby, one more time
One more time

[Verse 2]
Girl, you know you the shit tonight
You gon' get this dick tonight, that’s right, know you’re mine
And you can give me all of that lick tonight
I'm kissing both of your lips tonight
A nigga going harder, harder, I know you a bad girl
And I need it and that lame nigga just beat it
Two girls off the bed, that’s two stains, Versace, they body
Fuck ‘em with the Rollie on and two chains, wait

[Chorus]
I know, I know, every time I'm with her, every time I'm with
Every time I'm with her, she gon' break me off
I can’t wait to get her, I can’t wait to get
I know when I get her, I'ma break her off
I just can’t wait for you
So baby, please I need it more and more
Baby, one more time
One more time
