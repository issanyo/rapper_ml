[Verse 1]
I got what you want, want and girl, I want you
So grab a couple a friends and let's go out and if youâ€™re nasty, I'm nasty too
I've got a whole section already reserved for you
So bring your pretty ass over, to me

[Chorus]
I say, I ain't gon' talk ya ear off, girl, ain't gon' talk ya ear off
Girl, I won't talk ya ear off, girl, calling all the pretty ladies to the floor
Boy, don't talk my ear off, girl, I won't talk your ear off
Girl, don't talk my ear off, girl, but only if you follow me to the floor

[Verse 2]
Girl, I got your heart, heart, I know what to do, baby
Just sit that big ol' thing on my lap, that big ol' booty
I'm telling the truth, baby, it's only you that I gotta have
So bring your pretty ass over, to me

[Chorus]
I say, I ain't gon' talk ya ear off, girl, ain't gon' talk ya ear off
Girl, I won't talk ya ear off, girl, calling all the pretty ladies to the floor
Boy, don't talk my ear off, girl, I won't talk your ear off
Girl, don't talk my ear off, girl, but only if you follow me to the floor

[Bridge]
Oh no, yeah
Be about it, woohoo
You know it, girl
You know it, you know it baby

[Chorus]
I say, I ain't gon' talk ya ear off, girl, ain't gon' talk ya ear off
Girl, I won't talk ya ear off, girl, calling all the pretty ladies to the floor
Boy, don't talk my ear off, girl, I won't talk your ear off
Girl, don't talk my ear off, girl, but only if you follow me to the floor
