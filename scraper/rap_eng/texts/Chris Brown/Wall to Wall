[Intro]
Ladies, I'm gonna to need you all to back away from the door
We are trying to make way for Chris Brown
Ladies, you are not listening, I need you all to back away from the door
We are trying to make way for Chris Brown, I'm back

[Verse 1]
Pull up, pull up, can't believe the girls' club packed
What up, what up? Shawty wanna lead me to the back, to the back
Ain't been in here 15 minutes, got a pocket full of digits
And she just won't take no
Hold up, hold up, now little mama wanna get mad
Slow up, slow up, saying she don't wanna share what she have, she have
Ain't no particular one that's getting the water gun
So many that I want

[Chorus]
They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

[Verse 2]
Another two just came up and said they love me on the radio
Two twins, that's a cool little scenario
They talking leaving right now
Wanna put in some time cause you know what they're already about
One talking about she like the way that I pop
And the other one said she wanna just watch
I'm game for any damn thing
But there's more than 200 dames that's ready to go

[Chorus]
They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

[Bridge]
So many look good in here, I don't even know which one I want
If I had to choose y'all know I would take all y'all with me
Who wanna try me on the floor? Who ready to come and get this?
All I know is that I'm feeling this party and you can see I'm so with it

[Chorus]
They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

[Outro: Sean Garrett]

Yeah smash on the radio, bet I penned it
Yeah smash on the radio, bet I penned it
Yeah smash on the radio, bet I penned it, Chris Brown
