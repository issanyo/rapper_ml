[Verse 1]
Lately I've been throwing hints around there, I've been tryna get you to
Ooh, tryna get you to talk about it, what do I gotta do to
To get you to see them other dudes, they ain't me
They want to show you the same thing you already seen
I know you got another try in ya, oh, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, girl, I know your other man must of hurt you so, baby
Girl, tell me why you got me on hold, baby
Can you just give me the chance I should've had before, baby
Give it a chance, girl, one more gin

[Verse 2]
Whatever happened before you had me, girl, that don't matter no more
And I don't want to lie and say I'ma take it away when I know I won't
Girl, I know I can make you forget about him, I can show you how to live, live without him
I go hard in the paint, girl, it ain't what you think
Just believe it I can do it, oh, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, girl, I know your other man must of hurt you so, baby
Girl, tell me why you got me on hold, baby
Can you just give me the chance I should've had before, baby
Give it a chance, girl, one more gin

[Bridge]
I know you've heard it all before so, baby, I'ma just get right to it
And if you let it flow I'll give it to you
And make you see that, that I'm what you need in your life
Let me show you how to do it right

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, girl, I know your other man must of hurt you so, baby
Girl, tell me why you got me on hold, baby
Can you just give me the chance I should've had before, baby
Give it a chance, girl, one more gin
Oh, baby, girl, I know your other man must of hurt you so, baby
Girl, tell me why you got me on hold, baby
Can you just give me the chance I should've had before, baby
Give it a chance, girl, one more gin
