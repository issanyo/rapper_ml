[Verse 1]
You love another man
My heart is broken in two
She wears a ring on the other hand
She's scared to tell me the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
But, if you are leaving, oh
I want you to know that
I should've loved you way more, way more
So if this is the end of us now

[Chorus]
I'll see you 'round, I'll see you 'round, around
You mean more to me than anything
And it hurts cause you don't love me, no no no no
So I just wanna see you happy

[Verse 2]
Now that you are comfortable, I think that I am losing my mind
It's crazy cause we were so inseparable, guess things change with time
Oh, does he kiss and wipe away your tears? Does he tell you that there's nothing to fear?
Oh, if I had a wishing well, I would have you right here

[Pre-Chorus]
So girl if you are leaving, oh
Baby I want you to know that
I should've loved you way more, way more
So if this is the end of us now

[Chorus]
I'll see you 'round, I'll see you 'round, around
You mean more to me than anything
And it hurts cause you don't love me, no no no no
So I just wanna see you happy

[Bridge]
I didn't listen, you went missing, he has your heart now
I'm missing your kisses, want it again, donâ€™t leave me down
Wish I could keep you all to myself, I wanna work it out
But you moved on, I see it now, oh, oh, guess I'll see you around
