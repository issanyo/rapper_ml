[Intro]
Yeah, woah, oh

[Verse 1]
What the hell babe?
Damn I ain't never felt this way
Somebody, somebody tell me
I don't have a clue what to do when it comes to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you're so beautiful, every time I see you girl, it throw me off
It's so unusual for me to be waiting
But I don't wanna blow it girl
But you should know this girl, oh

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up
Cause I done effed up in love before
I'mma be the one to take a back-seat, girl
We can take our time and you can run this
Stay in, go out, anything you want girl we can do
Girl are we going down? I don't know
But from here now, baby I'm gon' leave that up to you
I'm gonna leave it up to you

[Verse 2]
What the hell babe?
Make me wanna jump out an airplane
The way it feels, I just can't explain
I don't wanna lose this, so I'm just gon' stay out my own way

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you're so incredible, every time I see you girl, it throw me off
It's some kind of special, so I'm gon' keep waiting
But I don't wanna blow it girl
But you should know this girl, woah

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up
Cause I done effed up in love before
I'mma be the one to take a back-seat, girl
We can take our time and you can run this
Stay in, go out, anything you want girl we can do
Girl are we going down? I don't know
But from here now, baby I'm gon' leave that up to you
I'm gonna leave it up to you

[Bridge]
I'm not tryna be a heart breaker like I was before, that was the old me
I've made so many tears, I don't wanna make no, make no more
So give me your list, let's start checking things off, ready to go to work, baby you can be boss
And I'm okay with it, ain't gon' play with it, so baby girl, it's your call

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up
Cause I done effed up in love before
I'mma be the one to take a back-seat, girl
We can take our time and you can run this
Stay in, go out, anything you want girl we can do
Girl are we going down? I don't know
But from here now, baby I'm gon' leave that up to you
I'm gonna leave it up to you

[Outro]
I'm gon' leave that you to you, leave that up to you
I'm gon' leave that you to you, leave it up to you
I'm gon' leave it up to you, leave it up to you
You you, oh, I'm gon' leave it up to you
