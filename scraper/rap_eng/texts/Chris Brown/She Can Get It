[Verse 1]
More money, more riches
More freaky model misses
Six four booty making hit switches
Shawty sitting on forty inches
I like her, she like me
I wanna love her, she wanna love me
That happening is unlikely
I got her thong where the ceiling fan lights be
Spinning like a tornado
Then I eat it up like it' gourmet food
Then I beat it up like boom, boom, boom
Then I get ghost like zoom
Climb on top of me, underneath the sheets
'Cause I'm about to take you down
And change your last name to Mrs. Brown

[Chorus]
She know she can get it, get it
She know she can get it, get it
She know she can get it, get it
So I'ma give it to her with that ghetto Kama Sutra
She know she can get it, get it
She know she can get it, get it
She know she can get it, get it
So I'ma give it to her with that ghetto Kama Sutra

[Verse 2]
If I don't give it to her, she gon' take it
But when she do it to you, she be faking
She a five star chick on my A-list
I have her body bent over like the Matrix
I ain't mad at her, do ya thing, girl
I bet you never had an R&B singer
I promise you will never go back
So let me hit it out the park
It go V.A., L.A., New York, Atlanta
Houston, Chi-town, rolling on the tour bus
I seen a lot of ladies but I'm feeling you
I gotta let you know, shawty, you can get it

[Chorus]
She know she can get it, get it
She know she can get it, get it
She know she can get it, get it
So I'ma give it to her with that ghetto Kama Sutra
She know she can get it, get it
She know she can get it, get it
She know she can get it, get it
So I'ma give it to her with that ghetto Kama Sutra
