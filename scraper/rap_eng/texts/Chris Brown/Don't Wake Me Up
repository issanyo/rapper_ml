[Intro]
Dearly beloved, if this love only exists in my dreams
Don't wake me up

[Verse 1]
Too much light in this window, don’t wake me up
Only coffee, no sugar inside my cup
If I wake and you're here still, give me a kiss
I wasn't finished dreaming about your lips

[Chorus]
Don’t wake me up, up, up, up, up
Don’t wake me up, up, up, up, up
Don’t wake me up, up, up, up, up
Don’t wake me up, don’t wake me
Don’t wake me up, yeah
Don’t wake me up, don’t wake me up
Don’t wake me up, yeah
Don’t wake me up, up, up, up, up
Don’t wake me up, don’t wake me

[Verse 2]
So much light in the city, you won't believe
Been awake some days now, no time to sleep
If your heart is a pillow, this love's the bed
Tell me what is the music, inside my head

[Chorus]
Don’t wake me up, up, up, up, up
Don’t wake me up, up, up, up, up
Don’t wake me up, up, up, up, up
Don’t wake me up, don’t wake me
Don’t wake me up, yeah
Don’t wake me up, don’t wake me up
Don’t wake me up, yeah
Don’t wake me up, up, up, up, up
Don’t wake me up, don’t wake me

[Bridge]
I don't wanna fall, fall, fall, fall asleep no
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you
I don't wanna fall, fall, fall, fall asleep no
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you

[Chorus]
Don’t wake me up, up, up, up, up
Don’t wake me up, up, up, up, up
Don’t wake me up, up, up, up, up
Don’t wake me up, don’t wake me
Don’t wake me up, yeah
Don’t wake me up, don’t wake me up
Don’t wake me up, yeah
Don’t wake me up, up, up, up, up
Don’t wake me up, don’t wake me
