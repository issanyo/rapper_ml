[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Uber me baby, tell me why you playing
Been on my mind, on my mind since the weekend
I leave you leaking, fuck 'round and drink it
Cause I'm off them drugs and you know a nigga peaking
This shit too easy for me cause I know that you leaving
Baby leave it for me, yeah
I'm off a blunt and I'm leaning, this time I might not remember
Baby that icy shit is getting old, old, old

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Na na na, oh no, why you got a nigga acting like this?
Oh na na, yeah, why the pussy got me acting like this?
Oh na na, I can't believe that I'm acting like this
Oh no no, yeah you got a nigga acting like this
Na na na, oh no, why you got a nigga acting like this?
Oh na na, why the pussy got me acting like this?
Oh na na, can't believe that I'm acting like this
Oh no no, yeah you got a nigga acting like this in it

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I'm so annoyed, this shit I can't avoid, you know
I just wanna hear you screaming out my name while I'm deep in your pussy
Got the Henny all in my system now, now I'm seeing things a little different now
Girl you ain't act right, give you that act right, baby when we get back to the crib
I love pulling your hair, baby put that ass in the air
Got the pussy flooding I swear and there ain't no other nigga out there
That's gon' smoke a blunt girl, I'm leaning, this time I might not remember
Girl I'm honest, I ain't gon' lie, girl that pussy a cutie pie

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Na na na, oh no, why you got a nigga acting like this?
Oh na na, yeah, why the pussy got me acting like this?
Oh na na, I can't believe that I'm acting like this
Oh no no, yeah you got a nigga acting like this
Na na na, oh no, why you got a nigga acting like this?
Oh na na, why the pussy got me acting like this?
Oh na na, can't believe that I'm acting like this
Oh no no, yeah you got a nigga acting like this in it

[Verse 3: Dee Cosey]
Balling baby, they ain't trapping like this
Man I'm tweaking while I'm acting like this
Baby why you always treat me like shit?
Only acting like a bitch cause I give you good dick
Uber to my crib, fuck you on the mattress
With the city bullshit, I'm a savage
Both hands on your ass, let me grab it
There ain't another nigga like this
Girl get that money, it's do or die
Only see green, nigga color blind
Look at my watch, I can't tell the time
Girl when we turn up, we out our minds
Throw that out my pocket, never out of line
Kill the pussy, I ain't never lie
Know that kitty got 9 lives
Keep that for a nigga, yeah you got a nigga acting like this

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Na na na, oh no, why you got a nigga acting like this?
Oh na na, why the pussy got me acting like this?
Oh na na, can't believe that I'm acting like this
Oh no no, yeah you got a nigga acting like this in it
