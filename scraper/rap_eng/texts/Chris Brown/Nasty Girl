[Pre-Chorus:]
All of my girls in here just like this
Hating ass chicks, they don't want none
Most of them probably wanna be like me
I'ma show them what I'm made of

[Chorus:]
I know you want a nasty girl
You like a fly and flashy girl
Your boyfriend ain't gon' pass me up
I'm a nasty girl, I'm a nasty girl
I know just what he wants
He wants me to give it up
And I ain't gonna front
I'm a nasty girl but I'm a classy girl

[Verse 1:]
Pussycat, Pussycat, Dolls on the floor
I can holla at the boy any time I wanna go
Any time you want some more, I can give him three or four
And my body's sweating, dripping and dancing up on the pole
This is the freak show, ready to lock and load
Heavy drinking, papi tripping on me now he gone
Thinking that I won't, him him, quit him and go
I'm a nasty girl, I'm a nasty girl
You can't even front on me, I'm too naughty
I got just what you need, I can be your shawty
You play it right and do things I like
Brother, you could get this nasty girl

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
All of my girls in here just like this
Hating ass chicks, they don't want none
Most of them probably wanna be like me
I'ma show them what I'm made of

[Chorus:]
I know you want a nasty girl
You like a fly and flashy girl
Your boyfriend ain't gon' pass me up
I'm a nasty girl, I'm a nasty girl
I know just what he wants
He wants me to give it up
And I ain't gonna front
I'm a nasty girl but I'm a classy girl

[Verse 2: Andre Merritt]
Y'all to do this chick that really do you right
That eye candy on your right hand side
Hold 'em there quit, I don't buzz 'em, I don't drive
Chick so slick, my lips so thick
You want a nasty girl to love you all night
C'mon selector, make me feel right
And get nasty ya wanna get nasty
Think ya can? Alright
Please you, caution when I'm working it
Nasty girl, I'm a nasty girl
She might make ya leave wifey
Here's a little nasty girl

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
All of my girls in here just like this
Hating ass chicks, they don't want none
Most of them probably wanna be like me

[Chorus:]
I know you want a nasty girl

[Verse 3:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeha
I'm in the Volvo with the whole roof gone
Everybody know how the boy done blown
Up in the stratosphere, outta here, I'm gone
By the way, I hit that, flip that and do my dance
Then I hear 'em moan
I ain't come with no security
I can do it on my own
Say what's new Pussycat? Woah
'Cause I been tryna getcha number and I'ma need you to
You gon' have to throw it back, woah
Stop procrastinating, fronting
I know what you wanna do
You got your girls, I'll bring my crew
I'll make sure all of them is cool
With what you saying, you gon' do
'Cause I'ma do some things too
And hopefully you do you, nasty girl
And I bet you everything you do, I could do it times two

[Pre-Chorus:]
All of my girls in here just like this
Hating ass chicks, they don't want none
Most of them probably wanna be like me
I'ma show them what I'm made of

[Chorus:]
I know you want a nasty girl
You like a fly and flashy girl
Your boyfriend ain't gon' pass me up
I'm a nasty girl, I'm a nasty girl
I know just what he wants

And I ain't gonna front
I'm a nasty girl but I'm a classy girl
