[Verse 1]
Woah, what are you thinking?
I know you see your cell phone blinking
Backwards and forwards I'm pacing
Tryna figure out why you ain't calling me back
What does it all mean?
Maybe tryna show me something
But you ain't gotta do it this way, no
Put yourself in my shoes tell me, what would you do

[Chorus]
She knows I been getting her on the phone
And I know she been getting it, something's wrong
Could it be that she's with the other dude
From her past, I know damn well that she ain't
She's not laughing with her girlfriends
Left a number talking 'bout it's him again
She better call pretty soon or I'm gonna have
To send the boys to find out just what she's been M.I.A

[Verse 2]
Is there a problem?
And if it's really one I'ma solve it
Don't know how you handeled other dudes but I'm not them
Girl, you running round got 'em thinking that I can't handle my thing
Oh, are you crazy? Did you really think you could play me?
I'm 'bout to show up on your door step
You better answer when I, knock, knock
You better be by yourself

[Chorus]
She knows I been getting her on the phone
And I know she been getting it, something's wrong
Could it be that she's with the other dude
From her past, I know damn well that she ain't
She's not laughing with her girlfriends
Left a number talking 'bout it's him again
She better call pretty soon or I'm gonna have
To send the boys to find out just what she's been M.I.A

[Bridge:]
You can't run 'cause the boys are find ya, girl
You can't hide 'cause you know I'm right behind ya, girl
If you telling the truth
Then why you acting like you're scared over there?
You can't run 'cause the boys are find you, oh
You can't hide 'cause you know I'm right behind you, oh
If what you say is true
Than why you can't call me back, baby, baby? Yeah

[Chorus]
She knows I been getting her on the phone
And I know she been getting it, something's wrong
Could it be that she's with the other dude
From her past, I know damn well that she ain't
She's not laughing with her girlfriends
Left a number talking 'bout it's him again
She better call pretty soon or I'm gonna have
To send the boys to find out just what she's been M.I.A
