[Hook: Chris Brown]
It’s ‘bout to go down, oh yeah
Baby, you’re gonna get your wish tonight
Lay it down, right here
Scream my name, baby I love you
Girl, wherever you are
I’ll be right by your side tonight
And if you’re wearing panties, take 'em off baby
I'mma do you wrong in the right way

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Alright, now I'mma do you wrong in the right way
Fucking with the lights on, know you had a long day
Hold you nigga down, girl I fuck with you the long way
Pull up to your college, then I fuck you in the hallway
Real nigga, all day, you know I don’t fuck with fakes
Said she on her period, she told me just to fuck her face
Real bitch, trill bitch, someone I could deal with
Feds try to run up in my crib, she hit the kill switch
She would never let me down, only wanna lift me up
When I got locked down in county, she was there to pick me up
Mind her business, know wussup, purple Sprite, she pour it up
Even bought a pound for a nigga, ‘bout to roll it up
If the lights off in the club, niggas still gon’ notice her
Gave my bitch my Lamborghini, nigga get your motor up
When I get that ass in my bed, I'mma bust her head open
Third leg stroking, got the whole bed soaking

[Hook: Chris Brown]
It’s ‘bout to go down, oh yeah
Baby, you’re gonna get your wish tonight
Lay it down, right here
Scream my name, baby I love you
Girl, wherever you are
I’ll be right by your side tonight
And if you’re wearing panties, take 'em off baby
I'mma do you wrong in the right way

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, you got that work, that pussy purr
That Lambo driver, she ride it, for sure
My chauffeur know wussup, it’s yours, I mean hers, she can concur
Baddest thing on this Earth, let me take my time
I'mma lick it first, I'mma make it hurt, put it in the dirt
Mmm, ha, that’s some crazy ass shit for you
And you know I got this hit for you, put this dick on you
Enjoy you, and I spoil you, uh
Back and forth, in and out, no backing off
My shit don’t harp, my lover love real don’t dissolve
Bitches ain't loyal, one love, but they hot and cold
I swerve that deuce on 'em, baby like this dick cold
T-Raww got that flame though
She want burgers in Bordeaux, stop giving that cause she mine doe
In this game you gotta find hope
I'm young and kingin', so you know what it is

[Hook: Chris Brown]
It’s ‘bout to go down, oh yeah
Baby, you’re gonna get your wish tonight
Lay it down, right here
Scream my name, baby I love you
Girl, wherever you are
I’ll be right by your side tonight
And if you’re wearing panties, take 'em off baby
I'mma do you wrong in the right way

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Let me kiss that body, when I get excited
When you scream my name, when you hit the notes, you gon' sound melodic
Baby girl just ride it, show me something they can’t see
Fuck me like you angry, playin' all of that K-Ci & Jojo
Them slow jams, we hold hands
Do that there like a stripper, on my dick she pole dance
Oh no, it’s going down, going down babe
Put it in reverse, flip it around babe
Yeah, ‘cause we’re one on one, busting round after round like a gun
Doing all that freaky shit to me, I love the way you put it down babe
I like it, when I'm in and out and you’re making them sounds babe
And I want some more, it’s about to go down

[Hook: Chris Brown]
It’s ‘bout to go down, oh yeah
Baby, you’re gonna get your wish tonight
Lay it down, right here
Scream my name, baby I love you
Girl, wherever you are
I’ll be right by your side tonight
And if you’re wearing panties, take 'em off baby
I'mma do you wrong in the right way
