[Intro]
Got, got it on smash
Got, got it on smash

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Pull up in that Bentley GT
Skrrt, skrrt, beep, beep (ooh)
Girl meet me in my bed
I'ma go down eat, eat
Ride them chi chis
So I’ma skeet, skeet, oh yeah baby
Got me on repeat, bitch wanna freak me
Girl, I know you ain't from 'round here
Shut up, shut up, make you cum easy
What up, what up, pussy come easy

[Verse 1: Lil Mosey]
Baby, on my dick, when she see a nigga pull up
Ice on my neck, diamonds looking like throw up
Yeah, pour up the lean, make a nigga start to slow up
Fuck, got suck then I show her where the door at
She want some more, who she working with
Came around the gang and she twerking shit
And you know she be wilding when she sit that shit
I done be moving fast like I’m whipping that shit
Like lately, we be going crazy
Put her on the team, now she want to have my babies
Trying to hold the phone, now a nigga feeling lazy
And I don't give a fuck, screaming fuck you pay me

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Pull up in that Bentley GT
Skrrt, skrrt, beep, beep (ooh)
Girl meet me in my bed
I'ma go down eat, eat
Ride them chi chis
So I'ma skeet, skeet, oh yeah baby
Got me on repeat, bitch wanna freak me
Girl, I know you ain't from 'round here
Shut up, shut up, make you cum easy
What up, what up, pussy come easy

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
They don't, they don't know, Papi Chulo
Runnin’ up a check, you see it
They don’t, they don't go, Dami Culo
’cause you know my shit amazin'
They don't want no smoke, want no smoke
Bitches wanna have a nigga baby
She get down on all fours, hop on the pole

Baby I'm ’bout to give you rounds so wild
Bump and grindin', it's the perfect timing
I'ma turn you out, no lyin'
You gon' see

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Pull up in that Bentley GT
Skrrt, skrrt, beep, beep (ooh)
Girl meet me in my bed
I'ma go down eat, eat
Ride them chi chis
So I'ma skeet, skeet, oh yeah baby
Got me on repeat, bitch wanna freak me
Girl, I know you ain't from 'round here
Shut up, shut up, make you cum easy
What up, what up, pussy come easy
