[Swizz Beatz: Chopped & Screwed]
Pop that bottle, pour it up
Get drunk, turn up (2x)

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Hit hit the floor, I say hit the floor
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Hit hit the floor, I say hit the floor (dance like a white girl)
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Hit hit the floor, it it it's yo' birthday trick
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor

Hit hit the floor, I say hit the floor

[Verse: Tyga]
Miley Cyrus, Mary Poppins, let's get it poppin'
Rock out, that's Janis Joplin
She a redhead, no Dennis Rodman
Don't Bush me, I'm a Red Bull sipper, don't cut my wings
I'm the tail of the jet, all you see is steam
Got a bad bitch, nude in the front seat
She make it bounce, bring yo' body i'll bring her out
Don't chase chase, that's cat and mouse
Everyday, I'm turnin' out, cause

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Hit hit the floor, I say hit the floor
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Everyday is your birthday now hit the floor
Hit hit the floor, dance like a white girl (2x)

[Outro: Chris Brown / Swizz Beatz]
It's yo' night, so drop it drop it (2x)
(Swizz: dance like a white girl 6x)
Drop it drop it (3x)
It's yo' night, so drop it drop it
