[Verse 1]
Tell me do you remember when
You were talking to your best friend and she mentioned
There was someone, a gentleman
Who was trying his best to extend an invitation

[Pre-Chorus]
If you get to know me, baby, it'll be a really good thing
And baby, no strings, I know it seems like I'm coming off strong
I hope you don't mind spending time, just you and me
I know you will have a good time

[Chorus]
That somebody was me, oh, girl
I'm the one that called you up with the blocked ID for a week
See I was holding back my feelings, wasn't sure
I wasn't sure how you would respond to me, it was me, girl

[Verse 2]
Girl, I bet you remember when
You went out with your girls clubbing and dancing, yeah
You glanced at a gentleman
I got your number from your girlfriends, they said you was wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
If you get to know me, baby, it'll be a really good thing
And baby, no strings, I know it seems like I'm coming off strong
I hope you don't mind spending time, just you and me
I know you will have a good time

[Chorus]
That somebody was me, oh, girl
I'm the one that called you up with the blocked ID for a week
See I was holding back my feelings, wasn't sure
I wasn't sure how you would respond to me, it was me, girl
That somebody was me, oh, girl
I'm the one that called you up with the blocked ID for a week
See I was holding back my feelings, wasn't sure
I wasn't sure how you would respond to me, it was me, girl
