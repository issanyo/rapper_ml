[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Stop
Where am I?
Shock
I can't cry
Pop
I need some space
No, this isn't me
Go, please let me breathe
I'll be back sooner than you know

[Chorus]
I need this space, just like you need air
I need this time, time to clear up my mind
Wait, did you hear that?
Shh, hear my heartbeat, shh
I need this feeling, yeah, I really need this

[Verse 2]
Wow
I've been blind
Hope I'll be fine
Don't hold me back, no
Yes, I see light
Now, it's alright
Call my name
I'll be me soon, oh

[Chorus]
I need this space, just like you need air
I need this time, time to clear up my mind
Wait, did you hear that?
Shh, hear my heartbeat, shh
I need this feeling, oh
Wait, did you hear that?
Shh, hear my heartbeat, shh
I need this feeling, yeah

[Breakdown]
I really need
I really need this
I really need, really, really need, need, need, yeah

[Bridge]
No, it's not personal
Sorry if I'm hurting you
Please don't give up on me, no
I needed this time alone to know I could come back home
To breathe, breathe, breathe

[Chorus]
I need this space, just like you need air
I need this time, time to clear up my mind
Wait, did you hear that?
Shh, hear my heartbeat, shh
I need this feeling, oh
Wait, did you hear that?
Shh, hear my heartbeat, shh
I need this feeling, yeah

[Outro]
I really need this
I need, need, need this feeling, oh
I need this
I need, need, need, need this, yeah yeah
Oh, yeah, uh
I really need, ooh, yeah
I need, need
Really, really, really
I need this, I need this, I need
I really need this
