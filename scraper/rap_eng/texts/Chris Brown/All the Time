[Chorus]
I think about you all the time, time (time)
Got me right here waiting (wait)
I think about you all the time (time)
Got me right here waiting
You ain't know you was my baby, my baby (that's my baby)
Even though you drive me crazy, yeah
Bet you ain't know you my baby, yeah
And you know you drive me crazy, oh, woah

[Verse 1]
She run up a check, fuck a Patek, I run up them digits (digits)
I fucked up the bed, left it a mess, do you remember? ('Member)
You know you was the best, you was the best, ain't no pretender (pretender)
Oh, woah (yeah)
Doing things you said you never would, would, would (would)
I call you late at night, I ain't no good, good, good (woo, woo!)
Let me eat that pussy, that's my pussy diet (diet)
You know most these niggas pussy, they canâ€™t try it

[Chorus]
I think about you all the time, time (time)
Got me right here waiting (wait)
I think about you all the time, all the time, all the time (time)
Got me right here waiting, right here
You ain't know you was my baby, my baby (that's my baby)
Even though you drive me crazy, yeah
Bet you ain't know you my baby, yeah
And you know you drive me crazy, oh, woah

[Verse 2]
If you don't want me, baby, why my number never blocked?
Tell me why, girl don't lie, 'cause I want this shit to stop
All this negative energy, we do not need, baby, we are not enemies
Only time we get rough, baby, when I'm fucking it up, giving you all that real love
Putting in overtime, working real hard
I'm tryna steal your heart
It's not always 'bout the diamonds or the ice that I buy
It's just a little milestone for a lifetime

[Chorus]
I think about you all the time, time (time)
Got me right here waiting (wait)
I think about you all the time (time)
Got me right here waiting
You ain't know you was my baby, my baby (that's my baby)
Even though you drive me crazy, yeah
Bet you ain't know you my baby, yeah
And you know you drive me crazy, oh, woah
