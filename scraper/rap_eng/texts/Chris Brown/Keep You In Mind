[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I like your bad attitude
Pull up on me, baby, with everything off
Tonight it's all about you, oh yeah
One on one, baby, all night
Your sex game strong, yeah
Girl, I been too excited
Going 'bout it all wrong, yeah, yeah
I need to step it up, yeah and turn them lights off, come here
Bring your body here to me, you know I like learning
We gon' break the bed, we gon' break the bed
You gon' get this head, girl, just spread your legs

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I know you like it and girl, I love your perfume
Girl, it's all about you, let's light this fire up
If it's room for two, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Bryson Tiller]
Can I keep you in mind?
Baby, tell me, can I, can I?
Baby, tell me, oh yeah, yeah
Can I keep you in mind (in my mind)

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
You got 'em wasting your time, wasting your time
What must I do to make you mine?
But you don't even gotta say it, nah, nah
Tell me am I wasting my time?
Even though we ain't together, whenever they ask me
I say that you're mine
But you've been out here saying different
Talking 'bout shit I say to them others
Girl, you must of said no, must of said, oh no
But you don't feel the same, oh no, no no no

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I know you like it and girl, I love your perfume
Girl, it's all about you, let's light this fire up
If it's room for two, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Bryson Tiller]
Can I keep you in mind?
Baby, tell me, can I, can I?
Baby, tell me, oh yeah, yeah
Can I keep you in mind (in my mind)
Can I keep you in mind?
Baby, tell me, can I, can I?
Baby, tell me, oh yeah, yeah
Can I keep you in mind?
In my mind
