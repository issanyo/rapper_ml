[Verse 1]
A material girl in her own world, can't even see the things she's missing
Right in the curve a little girl wanting to grow up and be a star
Take a look around, not looking down, all these things have blurred your vision
Material things don't amount to nothing but

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know how you feel
It's hard to see who's real

[Chorus]
It takes time, living in a world when you don't know who to trust
Next time, slow it down and don't feel you have to rush
It'll be fine
Takes time, takes time, to love

[Verse 2]
And I'ma tell the truth when it comes to you, my lady
And it's a miracle you have found a conscience, baby
I had a plan on leaving, you came and gave a reason
And now I know the reason why, why

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know how you feel, you feel
It's hard to see who's real, what's real, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

[Chorus]
It takes time, living in a world when you don't know who to trust
Next time, slow it down and don't feel you have to rush
It'll be fine
Takes time, takes time, to love
