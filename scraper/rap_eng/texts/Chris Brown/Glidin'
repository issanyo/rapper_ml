[Intro: Chris Brown]
Oh, you’re about to catch a flow
It’ll be so lovely, so lovely
Think I should tell you
Tell you how it goes
You chilling with the Sok
Sok or that purple

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
One hit, take me away
To another time, another space, another day
One more hit, blow me away
I could find another place
So you can find another way

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Doing all the same stuff beside your boy
By the time, I stepped through the door
I just wanna really tell you how I feel
Nobody else wants to keep it real
All the pretty girls stepping on the scene
Who can dress their ass off
And their walk is mean
All they wanna do is get up on the floor
But the really cool people don’t dance anymore

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
They just glidin’, we glidin’ (glide)
They glidin’, they glidin’
Just glidin’, they glidin’
They glidin’, they glidin’
They -

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
She’s phased, he’s in a daze
Thirsty girls look around
While the others frown, not doin’ anything
So, get your kicks, in whatever way
Then let me tell you to your face
‘Cause it’s a shame to let it go to waste

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
Doing all the same stuff beside your boy
By the time, I stepped through the door
I just wanna really tell you how I feel
Nobody else wants to keep it real
All the pretty girls stepping on the scene
Who can dress their ass off
And their walk is mean
All they wanna do is get up on the floor
But the really cool people don’t dance anymore

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
They just glidin’, we glidin’ (glidin’)
They glidin’, they glidin’
Just glidin’, they glidin’
They glidin’, they glidin’
They -

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
Sometimes people think that
They can fool the world into believing
That they are original
But they are only fools and
So I, find a place in my mind
Where nobody else can go
Drifting, floating, gliding
So many places

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa & Chris Brown]
Now a nigga glidin’
Do it from the front, back to the side in
I gotta roll one up, ‘fore a nigga drived in
Blow a couple hunnid
You might think it’s stuntin’
But to me its really nothin’, oh
Who you came with? (With)
Who the ones spendin’ money like it ain’t shit? (shit)
Me, now im poppin’ champagne
Hella niggas rollin’ in here throwin’ up the gang (up the gang)
Uhm, you ain’t gotta ask, already know (gotta ask, already know)
You don’t need a grinder, ‘cause they already rolled
And everything I blow is potent in the air
‘Cause me and Breezy got ‘em floating (haha)
What you smoking? (Smoking)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Wiz Khalifa]
Glidin’, we glidin’ (haha)
They glidin’, they glidin’ (oh, we glidin’)
Glidin’, they glidin’
They glidin’, they glidin’ (so we’re glidin’ baby)
They glidin’, they glidin’ (glidin’)
They glidin’, they glidin’ (yeah we’re glidin’)
Glidin’, they glidin’ (say we’re glidin’)
Glidin’, they glidin’ (oh yeah we’re glidin’)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Candy, Apple, Holly
She feel like a Molly
It’ll be so lovely, so lovely
We came to party
Girl you’re getting naughty
But, your friends to ugly to fuck with me
Let me refrain’ cause these paper planes
Got my brain, stained, i'm trippin’ mayne (trippin’ mayne)
Me and my gang
In here super fucked up, off the same thing
I need my shades (I need my shades)
(I need my shades, I need my shades)
