[Intro: TeGunz & (Chris Brown)]
Alright guys, sup coach
We in a must-win situation (alright)
I want you to play this game like it's your last game
Let's go get it

[Verse 1: TeGunz]
Okay, this the type of beat that you bounce to, bounce to
Beat your feet, let the other team know
If the other team whack then the team gotta go
When the fans lose they mind when they see us on the floor
Yo, first quarter, first cross-border
A eye on the court, the other eye on your daughter
The other team ain't used to this sorta play
And I don't play and put up this sorta
Jersey fit right and my shorts hang low
Ankle brace pulled tight, man, I'm dressed to score
It's the street's little court, now I'm stuntin'
The scoreboard say about 100 to nothing, yeah
Toss then I posted up up 'em
Point to the alley-oop and let 'em dunk that
It ain't nothin', I'm chillin', mindin' my business
On my job, ballin' hard tryna give me some digits
Yeah, nothin' but swishes, the points get assisted
The team had a chance, the young boy missed it
Off the glass kisses, no look dishes
Taking y'all boys to school, so pay attention

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
First quarter, we got our game face on (yeah)
Second quarter, we got our game face on (yeah)
Third quarter, we got our game face on (c'mpn)
Fourth quarter, we got our game face on (yeah)
Jump off, we got our game face on (uh-huh)
D-town, we got our game face on (yeah)
Half-time, we got our game face on (let's go)
Game over, we got our game face on (uh)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Charlie Brown, yeah, I'm at it again
Makin' moves on the court, not talkin' 'bout dancin'
I'm well aware that these dudes gon' foul
Opponents might hate, but they cheerleaders smile
Wow, I'm ballin', boy
Get too close, hot sauce, you fallin', boy
Now, girls screamin' out my name, it's Sizzle
Cookie and the boys, take it back to the dribble, hey
How you play with your overgrown but?
And players slam on you while you dunkin' donuts
Hold up, I guess you missed it
We the best team in northern dictrict
Forget it 'cause I don't think you came to ball
'Cause y'all waterboy got more game than y'all
Okay, locked down with an all-white fresh tee
Jersey on top, playa, how you gon' check me?
Put the hands up, player, stop leanin'
Pull your pants up, crossover, boy, now get your dance up
E-Town ballers is at it again
'Cause we runnin' VA, Verbal Assassins, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
First quarter, we got our game face on (yeah)
Second quarter, we got our game face on (yeah)
Third quarter, we got our game face on (c'mpn)
Fourth quarter, we got our game face on (yeah)
Jump off, we got our game face on (uh-huh)
D-town, we got our game face on (yeah)
Half-time, we got our game face on (let's go)
Game over, we got our game face on (uh)

[Verse 3: TeGunz]
Look at my fans, do it look like they grin?
Didn't come here to smile, boy, I came here to win
The vertical limit is only ten
So that means I'm dunkin' on you and your mans
Uh, pull your socks up, boy
While I give you this E-Town toy (let's go)
Ball, skeet, skeet, around my basket
Round your neck, uh, uh let's go, fall low
In my face, say shave the pit
Fourth quarter, we givin' it, uh
No, just know we ain't trained to skeet
What you see is what you get, skeet
Uh, uh, my mama told me to give you a triple-double
The coach told me to score but I gotta hustle
Back to the D, back to the team
So you winnin' is only a dream
So pass me the clock, I run outta clock
And one, and two, I got the game on lock
Thought your coach done gave you the ball
He don't know that I came here to ball (let's go)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
First quarter, we got our game face on (yeah)
Second quarter, we got our game face on (yeah)
Third quarter, we got our game face on (c'mpn)
Fourth quarter, we got our game face on (yeah)
Jump off, we got our game face on (uh-huh)
D-town, we got our game face on (yeah)
Half-time, we got our game face on (let's go)
Game over, we got our game face on (uh)
