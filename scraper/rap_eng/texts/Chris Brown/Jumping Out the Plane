[Intro: Chris Brown & Luvaboy TJ]
Oh okay, oh okay
Life is so high, I feel like jumping out the plane, too fly

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Okay, pull up, just pop up all these bad bitches at my house
Two girls on my coach and I beat the pussy up, roundhouse
Lit candle, she blew it, I'm rich, she knew it
Her booty so stupid I'm like, damn, girl, just do it, do it
I'm about to get all of them and hand it to my partner and them
Superhero, I'm Rapman, if you Batman then we robbin' them
With this math, I'm solvin' it, all this money I revolve it
Around me, I'm low-key, go overtime when I'm ballin'

[Hook: Luvaboy TJ]
Money on my brain, conquerin' the plane
Fly, feel so high, feel like jumpin' out the plane
Balancin' my drink, swervin' in your lane
Luvaboy's is winnin', you can tell by my chain
Money on my brain, conquerin' the plane
Fly, feel so high, feel like jumpin' out the plane
Balancin' my drink, swervin' in your lane
Luvaboy's is winnin', you can tell by my chain

[Verse 2: Luvaboy TJ]
New York, I gotta get there fast wait,ut a perpetrator on a plane, bait
Niggas they hate 'cause they pushin' my dick, swingin' foreplay, game in the third lane
Straight to the money, fuck breakfast, I'm the type to stunt with my exes
'Cause I'm rich, young and reckless, grindin' all night, I'm restless
Big racks in my bank account, ain't never goin' back to bein' broke
I hustle hard, above over time, black man's one's of a kind
Takin' off, I'm on the ride, my business well organised
The way I got these girls in a trance, I got this poor dodo traumatised
Ring ring, my phone go, these hoes on my mojo
They wanna get me solo, but that there's a no no
Walkin' on holy ground, on 22's when I roll around
High off my altitude, no parachute, I'm jumpin' out
I'm goin' in, no late tags, I'm in the game and it's over now
I'm boardin' my flight, 7 am, I'm in it to win
I did it before and Iâ€™ll do it again
No fuckin' my ten, that's what on my brims

[Hook: Luvaboy TJ]
Money on my brain, conquerin' the plane
Fly, feel so high, feel like jumpin' out the plane
Balancin' my drink, swervin' in your lane
Luvaboy's is winnin', you can tell by my chain
Money on my brain, conquerin' the plane
Fly, feel so high, feel like jumpin' out the plane
Balancin' my drink, swervin' in your lane
Luvaboy's is winnin', you can tell by my chain
