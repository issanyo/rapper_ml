[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Baby, what's your name?
'Cause I gotta be honest
I ain't never seen no ass like that before
Guess you got it from your mama
Girl, you're a real baddy
Got your own money, nothin' from a nigga, you don't need none
You smoke weed, baby, I like it
But you ain't never fucked with a nigga like this

[Pre-Chorus]
So give me a chance just to try it
Girl, you let me know if you like it or not
'Cause I don't give a damn if your girls gon' hate
Looking at me funny, get the fuck out my face
'Cause all they do is talk shit, see me when they walk in
And they can see that you was coming my way

[Chorus]
No thots, only them bad bitches
No thots, you don't no man, don't need no man
No thots ‘cause only them bad ones standing here
Don't act like you don't want it
In the morning, going out with me
No thots, only them bad bitches
No thots, you don't no man, don't need no man
No thots, ‘cause only them bad ones standing here
Don't act like you don't want it
In the morning, going out with me

[Outro]
No thots, it's only them bad bitches
No thots, only them bad bitches (Ha!)
