[Verse 1]
Baby I ain't gotta be the boss to sound this fine
Cause any time i want, imma get mine
When i put my tongue on your petty line
Eat that like brain fast, leave his ass in the past
He keep bringing my name up, cause you started to change up
It's morning time, wrapped up in my covers for the night tonight
Cause he couldn't fuck you behind your white eye
Ain't no competition, let's be serious, I'm the best period ooh yeah

[Chrous]
(Know she)
Ain't mine, ain't mine, ain't my girl
She ain't mine, ain't mine, ain't my girl
No matter what
