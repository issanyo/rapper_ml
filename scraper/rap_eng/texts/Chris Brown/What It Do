[Intro: Sean Garrett]
Get down, all the ladies get down
I done got you all up in here with my brother Chris Brown
Get down, all the ladies get down
I done got you all up in here with your favourite Chris Brown

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tell me what it is, show me what we doing
You had me going on the phone all night long, now I wanna get to it
Shawty like for real, I always knew it
The way you used to tell me I was just too young, girl, you know what you're doing

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I bet you thought it would never be CB in the Lambo
Pulling up in suicide doors
'Bout a year, a couple of years back
Told me I could get it if I was only a couple years older
But it's clear that I'm 61, stunting off and running
And legal to feed you what the heart wants
We done a lot of talking but I'm tired of talking
Tell me what you offering so I can get to giving what you want

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You can be the first one to drive it up, just got it
With the automatic, gets 'em up, real private
We ain't never gon' have no interruptions
Don't worry 'bout my home boys, knocking at the door, they'll be no interruptions

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tell me what it is, show me what we doing
You had me going on the phone all night long, now I wanna get to it
Shawty like for real, I always knew it
The way you used to tell me I was just too young, girl, you know what you're doing

[Interlude: Sean Garrett]
Get down, all the ladies get down
I done got you all up in here with my brother Chris Brown
Get down, all the ladies get down
I done got you all up in here with your favourite Chris Brown

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
In the background you're playing my songs
Won't you tell me what you got on?
And better yet, baby, won't you shoot me a quick flick
Message with all the things you been speaking of
All grown up for real now
Been wanting to get at you for so long
'Cause we done been up in the 'lac
And you remember "Gimme, Gimme That"
Trust me if I hit it
You gon' recognise it

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You can be the first one to drive it up, just got it
With the automatic, gets 'em up, real private
We ain't never gon' have no interruptions
Don't worry 'bout my home boys, knocking at the door, they'll be no interruptions

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tell me what it is, show me what we doing
You had me going on the phone all night long, now I wanna get to it
Shawty like for real, I always knew it
The way you used to tell me I was just too young, girl, you know what you're doing
