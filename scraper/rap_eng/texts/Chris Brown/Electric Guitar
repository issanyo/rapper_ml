[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
He plays the sweetest melody
When I hear, it takes over me
And I feel every strum of his strings
It reminds me of all the things we used to be
Can't breathe at all 'cause you're coming

[Chorus: Andre Merritt]
Coming through my speaker, speaker
Got me tryna reach ya, reach ya
My analogue feature, feature
My electric guitar
Every time I mind you, mind you
Every time I'm by him, by him
You're ripping it up on them chords
Playing my heart
Electric guitar, electric guitar, electric guitar
Electric guitar, electric guitar, electric guitar

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
It kills me that I can't be with you
Thought I was the key you're playing
Don't know, I just gotta
Be the one you let bleed out
Wish I didn't know you, got me feeling stuck
I can't let you go, just my luck
Falling down without you, can you pick me up?
And now I can't get you off my head because you're coming

[Chorus: Andre Merritt]
Coming through my speaker, speaker
Got me tryna reach ya, reach ya
My analogue feature, feature
My electric guitar
Every time I mind you, mind you
Every time I'm by him, by him
You're ripping it up on them chords
Playing my heart
Electric guitar, electric guitar, electric guitar
Electric guitar, electric guitar, electric guitar

[Bridge: Andre Merritt]
I'm losing my composure, all quit, game over
You must think that I'm crazy, girl
Please control me with your melody
I'll play it for the world 'cause I'm your girl and I just wanna hear, so

[Chorus: Andre Merritt]
Coming through my speaker, speaker
Got me tryna reach ya, reach ya
My analogue feature, feature
My electric guitar
Every time I mind you, mind you
Every time I'm by him, by him
You're ripping it up on them chords
Playing my heart
Electric guitar, electric guitar, electric guitar
Electric guitar, electric guitar, electric guitar
