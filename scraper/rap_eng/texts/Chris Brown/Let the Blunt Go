[Intro: Funk Flex]
League of Starz
Sorry Jaynari
Funk Flex, Chris Brown
Who you mad at? Me or yourself?

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Gold chain, gold chain
Gettin' money gon' and watch these hoes change
I'm in the party, got these bitches off molly and they rollin'
Bitches poppin' pills like it's for pain
In their eyes I'm the shit
Molly probably fantasisin' all about my dick
Only one real nigga, take a pic
And all you haters, I'ma take your bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Every nigga in the club see the same hoe
With the same friends, all they do is change clothes
Try to bowl and they pussies, say their lane closed
If you fuckin' for your rent, you a lame hoe
Oops, yeah, I said that
Half of y'all niggas in here frontin', where your bread at?
I-I-I-I, gon’ stutter rap
Thought so, can’t do it like this, broke nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If say you got to work, why you in the club, hoe?
Hell no, you can’t smoke my drugs so
Now you in the club tryna fuck no love, hoe
How you do that there? Bitch, let the blunt go
Say you got to work, why you in the club, hoe?
Hell no, you can’t smoke my drugs so
Now you in the club tryna fuck no love, hoe
How you do that there? Bitch, let the blunt go

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Too many cars, a parade when I pull up
Glass jaw, catch a fade, that’s a chin up
If you ain't lookin', I'ma eat your hoe for dinner
She said that she a virgin but I fucked her in Virginia, haha
I ate her at the SupperClub
Bad bitches at Greystone, but they just some runner ups
Now every nigga in here seein' if you tryna fuck
And every nigga in here schemin', gon' try your luck
Ha, I'm A-1, no steak sauce, nigga, they spray dumb
It's like ratatatat
Cross your baseball cap
A couple hoes in your face like Jason

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Every nigga in the club see the same hoe
With the same friends, all they do is change clothes
Try to bowl and they pussies, say their lane closed
If you fuckin' for your rent, you a lame hoe
Oops, yeah, I said that
Half of y'all niggas in here frontin' where your bread at?
I-I-I-I, gon’ stutter rap
Thought so, can’t do it like this, broke nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If say you got to work, why you in the club, hoe?
Hell no, you can’t smoke my drugs so
Now you in the club tryna fuck no love, hoe
How you do that there? Bitch, let the blunt go
Say you got to work, why you in the club, hoe?
Hell no, you can’t smoke my drugs so
Now you in the club tryna fuck no love, hoe
How you do that there? Bitch, let the blunt go

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Every nigga in the club see the same hoe
With the same friends, all they do is change clothes
Try to bowl and they pussies, say their lane closed
If you fuckin' for your rent, you a lame hoe
Oops, yeah, I said that
Half of y'all niggas in here frontin' where your bread at?
I-I-I-I, gon’ stutter rap
Thought so, can’t do it like this, broke nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If say you got to work, why you in the club, hoe?
Hell no, you can’t smoke my drugs so
Now you in the club tryna fuck no love, hoe
How you do that there? Bitch, let the blunt go
Say you got to work, why you in the club, hoe?
Hell no, you can’t smoke my drugs so
Now you in the club tryna fuck no love, hoe
How you do that there? Bitch, let the blunt go
