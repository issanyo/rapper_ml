[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Pitbull)]
We could be anywhere tonight
But we're right here underneath the lights
I see the colors in your eyes
Beautiful rainbows all around us
We got the whole world in our hands (Mr. Worldwide)
This is the night we won't forget (Chris Brown)
Whatever happens in the end, I just hope
I hope we meet again

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & (Pitbull)]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
I just hope, I hope we meet again (to those lost but never forgotten)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
One thing's for certain, two things for sure, iHeart radio, I close show
My life's like Broadway, no cameras, welcome to the show
One time for them boys on Dyckman
Broadway, Nagle, and posted on Post
Papo, I told ya, they'll be coming back one day
Throw this song to the world and watch 'em catch it like a bouquet
Australia to UK, jump the puddle straight to the States
It's okay let 'em hate 'cause they'll be coming back one day, dal√©

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We could be anywhere tonight
But we're right here underneath the lights
I see the colors in your eyes
Beautiful rainbows all around us
We got the whole world in our hands
This is the night we won't forget
Whatever happens in the end, I just hope
I hope we meet again

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & (Pitbull)]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I hope we meet again
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I just hope, I hope we meet again (to those lost but never forgotten)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Now the world is my backyard and I would like to thank y'all
'Cause I was at a point, point blank, that I would point blank y'all
I found myself, in turn, I lost my mind
Sometimes I feel like an old school marimbero lost in time
They say to be wise, is to know what you don't know
And I don't know shit, does that make me wise? Papo, I don't know
But this much I can't say, to my best friend Eddie, my father, Guarilla, Abuelo Rudy, and to my brother Drama, I'll be back for you one day (woo)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
We could be anywhere tonight
But we're right here underneath the lights
I see the colors in your eyes
Beautiful rainbows all around us
We got the whole world in our hands
This is the night we won't forget
Whatever happens in the end
I just hope, I hope we meet again

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
To the world, and all my friends, I hope we meet again
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
To the world, and all my friends, I hope we meet again
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
To the world, and all my friends, I hope we meet again
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
To the world, and all my friends, I hope we meet again
I hope we meet again
