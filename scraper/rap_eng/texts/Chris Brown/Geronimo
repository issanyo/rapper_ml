[Verse 1]
I've fallen from grace, I've made mistakes
Wondering, wishing that I
You just changed the past, babe
One day, my love, can change all of it
I can't even, oh my parachute opening up
So I'm leaving, if I let it with no pressure

[Pre-Chorus]
Like an acrobat or a fighter jet
I'll just soar through the air 'cause I'm so fearless
When I reach my mark, hope that it's your heart
At the end it's all worth it, just thought I'd scream

[Chorus]
Geronimo
Girl, the clouds are blinding my eyes from free falling
Geronimo
No more holding back, finally letting go
I'm gonna show you I ain't scared to jump
And you don't even seem that far away
Yeah, yeah, I'll base jump, base jump
For your love

[Verse 2]
Up in the rain, as I'm falling through the storm
And the lightning's in my face
Girl, you're beautiful
Oh what a day 'cause girl, it ain't the usual
And the sky is bright now
And I can feel it 'cause I'm getting closer
And no one else gave me a chance to fly
Feels like I'm in outer space
And your gravity is pulling me down right now

[Pre-Chorus]
Like an acrobat or a fighter jet
I'll just soar through the air 'cause I'm so fearless
When I reach my mark, hope that it's your heart
At the end it's all worth it, just thought I'd scream

[Chorus]
Geronimo
Girl, the clouds are blinding my eyes from free falling
Geronimo
No more holding back, finally letting go
I'm gonna show you I ain't scared to jump
And you don't even seem that far away
Yeah, yeah, I'll base jump, base jump
For your love

[Bridge]
Base jump, base jump
I'll base jump, base jump, girl
Base jump, base jump for your love
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Geronimo
Girl, the clouds are blinding my eyes from free falling
Geronimo
No more holding back, finally letting go
I'm gonna show you I ain't scared to jump
And you don't even seem that far away
Yeah, yeah, I'll base jump, base jump
For your love

[Outro]
I'll base jump, base jump
For your love
I'll base jump, base jump
For your love
I'll base jump, base jump
For your love
