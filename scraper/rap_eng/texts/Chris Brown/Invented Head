[Intro]
In My Zone, oh baby
Rhythm and Streets
Baby, what turn you on? We can do that
I'm in my zone baby, believe me

[Verse 1]
Soon as I walked in the room she was on me
Like nigga take them clothes off and put it on me
So I'm 'bout to go hard for real
Let me throw your ass on the bed peel
Your pants, your shirt, panties and your bra
Right off of your body, and put you on the wall
Who you gonna call when you need the D?
You already know I'm a freak in the sheets

[Chorus]
When I get you to the crib (back to the crib)
Upstairs in the bed (upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gon' think, girl you gon' think
Girl you gon' think, girl you gon' think
That I'm a champion (I'm a winner)
I know how to get it done (hell yeah)
Girl you gon' think, girl you gon' think, I'mma make you think
You gon think, you gon think, you gon think I invented head

[Verse 2]
I be having you singing like opera
Put that soprano on your tone like Opera
I use my tongue yeah I'm the cookie monster
You an Amazon so can you take this anaconda?
This the shit so I had to get it on this
Not even 21 but I'm already on that grown shit
So can I lick it, lick it, lick it?
Why you think we in the kitchen?

[Chorus]
When we get back to the crib (back to the crib)
Upstairs in the bed (upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gon' think, girl you gon' think
Girl you gon' think, girl you gon' think
That I'm a champion (I'm a winner)
I know how to get it done (hell yeah)
Girl you gon' think, girl you gon' think, I'mma make you think
You gon think, you gon think, you gon think I invented head

[Bridge]
