[Verse 1: Shad]
Yo, I ain't no hard hustlin muscle man thug on the curb
The only time I use a bullet is on Microsoft Word
Slick talk you could say I got grease on my speech
From years of rhymin' with a fried chicken piece in my teeth
But now I'm more self sufficient, the food in my shelves and kitchen
Give my cells nutrition the help with my health conditions
While I never been too stable cerebrally radio frequency rappers still ain't able to equal me
Plus I link with them, cause the phatter the beats
The words I'm battlin' peeps while I'm scattering speech
Like jabs to your cheeks shattering teeth
Drop the dagger in deep rattlin jeeps
With bass levels that no ladder can reach
Shad be that freak with them 5 mic classics
Still rappin' on the street and sellin' tapes out his jacket
No lights in action in the places I bust a flow
The only rap videos I make are instructional
Trust the full power my verse packs
And closed the kitchen I worked at when they heard how I serve cats

[Verse 2: Shad]
(So are you wild)
Like girls gone with them Mardi Gras pearls on
(But Canada can't bring it)
I'm here to prove the world wrong
The real deal, I'm just tryin' to keep my wheels steel
I work fightin' in a box office like Kill Bill
I'm chill live freestylin' to jams
The crowds flip cause my rhyme style's Wilder than Van's
And my DJ's nice on the tables like coasters
Were tryin' to see all the honey's wavin' our posters
Cause yo, they don't dig it, I ain't tryin' to be hyped out
With a mic I'm cold lighting the Brian McKnight, rappin's done
Forget the verbal wrecks, I'm singin' back at 1:00 in purple Mexx turtle necks and khakis, son
No shame, burn slow brains like propane
It's just Shad no add-ons or code names
Like cocaine when I do lines, the new rhymes is dope
I do the thing wild like my name is Tone-Loc
More wild than the west was when Kool Moe Dee
An OG bringin' the sickest drama since The O.C

[Verse 3: Shad]
In a crazy world meanin' I'm sane
In a break from all this nonsense they're feedin' your brain
While Nas and Janet halftimes when this cat signs
I'll own the masters like Tiger and get green like a back nine
And I don't make the cash mine and that's fine
I'd rather live with these ups and downs than flat-line
Still, my jams rock the body like kidney stones
When I pass through, I got more soul than Shaq's shoe
I be receivin' more paper than a fax do
For inspiration I draw on people like a tattoo artist
Regardless of the hardships we face
The world ain't so cold when your heart is embraced
So grace is the home where I rest in peace as the dead skin on my couch
Speaking with brethren and spittin' punch line with that stupid smile
That go your crew sayin' "Ha!" like Juvenile
If I'm on your radio then don't you move the dial
Just snap your neck to the music like you knew it's wild
