[Verse]
Rap genius, heads saying he should blow
Rap Genius got good quotes and footnotes
Look, who else spitting the most urgent
Most soul-searching perfectly dope verses (and no curses)
Ask any analyst, journalist, panelist
Who's Canada's unanimous circa-98 Canibus
Ambulance vans, when my jams spin it's calamitous
Sending bands into banishment
Dammit, I need no laminate
Ya'll know the name, I'm the rap game villain
Shad K backstage in the batcave, chillin'
Bumping Bad Brains with a bad dame
Wheeling in the fast lane
Rugrat, still these cats can't kill him
Kids talking 'bout, "I just need a co-sign, one break!"
All I need's a drum break and one take
I'm unsafe, ya'll soft as Sunday brunch dates with Bundt cake
Got crowds jumping like I just done a pump fake
Man, this is just one-eighth, just a morsel
I got more flows, ya'll just mortals
Even moreso, this is morse code from the North Pole
To warn folks: the Stormcrow's coming through your warzone
Lord knows I was born dope, going back like corn rows
I amaze (maize) like corn rows
Pure jokes, still I can rage like hormones
I'm an oracle, I'm next level--Warp Zone
The Forbes shows what they net, but I'm more gross
Sick as a sore throat, the kid isn't normal
Hardcore flows but he spit with a warm tone
The whip isn't much but his chick is a Norah Jones
I'm eating all ya'll food by the forkload
Golden arches or ol' girl with the orange 'fro
No, actually I'll have your pork roast and orzo
Make a short toast then pop the cork off the Bordeaux
I can hold court with the foremost
I could tour coasts or teach a course-load at the Sorbonne
Forget four bars, every quarter note's historical
When I perform poems, I'm a force, I'm a horror show
Man, I'm in my z--I'm in your zone
I'm on your porch, in your home
Taking everything like it foreclosed
Just me and T staking claims, taking names
I guess some things stay the same
Still the champ
