[Intro]
Though I empathize with 'em and sympathize with 'em
(x4)

[Verse 1]
Though I empathize with 'em and sympathize with 'em
I don't enterprise with 'em or synchronize with 'em
We don't strategize with 'em, we're not allies with 'em
We don't fratenize with 'em, let 'em patronize
We don't want no ties with 'em, we won't monopolize with 'em
Let 'em ostracize, we don't compromise with 'em
We won't victimize with 'em, commit genocide with 'em
Spit their lies with 'em or objectify women with 'em
Socialize with 'em, broke my ties with 'em
Now we open-eyed in this over-hyped system
We know

[Hook]
This wisdom of man is foolishness to God
Don't build on the sand or trust in the odds
Be shrewd as the snakes and innocent as doves
Don't succumb to hate, overcome hate with love
[x2]

[Verse 2]
We're taught not to question the status quo cause the masses
Never get heard, that's unless you're established
With expert professors in dress-shirts and glasses
That lecture to classes from lecterns where next term
The best third will pass and earn cash working as
Desk clerks for the best firms in Manhattan
Where the pressure can crack 'em cause networks and net worth
And class get treasured over pleasures that last
Always measuring stacks, a passion for lesser
God's growing, see, the distraction is clever
But trust

[Hook]

[Verse 1 (repeated)]
