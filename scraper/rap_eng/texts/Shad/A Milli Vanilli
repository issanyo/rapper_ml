Verse 1
Young man on the street with a tec drawn
Unless it's on Yonge Street it gets slept on
For the already lost, and the next gone
Gotta do my best, it's a fresh new next jawn
Kids play this on the block like it's hopscotch
Men that got guap play this in their drop-tops
And turn this line up here if the cops watch:
No you're not pigs, but the profiling's hogwash
As I continue to drive slow, 5-0
Hi habesha girl with the fly clothes
It says "Shady" when I call on your iPhone
And I get the feeling that it's not a typo
Oooh, blame it on the rain
A lot of cats rap, but don't know what they say
It's not just Milli-Vanilli, city-to-city I'm Diddy samplin' Scritti Politti until I'm dizzy Shad Kizzy

(Interlude)

Verse 2

Ahem
Mozart just wrote a whole chart
I'm trying to open up doors, spit crowbars
Go hard for my fanbase, slide off the lampshade, shine, that's the mandate
T is on the cut, I don't need a Band-Aid
Ian is ill, please excuse my bandmates
We just wanna rampage can't stay long just a handshake
Gone 'cross the landscape, thanks y'all Plan A is good
Girl you know it's true
I haven't made a milli, but what you gonna do?
Man I'm trying to stay tasteful and I'm grateful
Though still this is live from the underground, April O'Neil on that cable show
Real turntables both wheels and a fatal flow, ill with the fader, show skills yo, We major like
Kanye and Nas say, do this all day
Sickest cut since that fade on Blade Shad K!
