[Verse 1]
I'm just a 5'10 ?????
???????????????
????????
Pour it off the top like condiments
Each song dispensed
Get ??????????????
While they records barely lasts as long as when Donovan had the strongest sprint
They lack confidence
I'm not convinced
Til they ????? ?????????
Claims to fame and dominance
On they own block
Heads look so shocked
They way I raise eyebrows, my flows not unlike botox
Your boy's finally winning like the BoSox
I'm ????? crumbs like a ?????, oh stop
I'm just ?????????????????? Was happenin
We makin even dope emcees not want to rap again

[Chorus]
Uuhh Shook
These rappers need to stay up in my good books
And not on the bad side
Shad in the K is capsized
Who raised these kids?
Yal need a time out worse than the Fab 5

Uuhh shook
Women only feel me cuz my good looks
Please move the flow is mad live
Reciting these ??? tech like a rabi
Battling is just no fair like ?????

[2nd Verse]
I might have been Arnold in a past life
With his political slash big screen ??(linguist)?? cus I would act right
But now I rap like
I'm on a crackpipe
So my style is rat like
And that is what all theses cats bite
They couldn't see my level with a publicist
?????? to get em mad hype
Give em a ladder and a flash light
And a telescope stationed on the clouds cuz yea I'm at that height
I laugh like a hyena, I know it irritates
But I don't just flow, I make minds grow, I irrigate
After rappers hear my tape
They fear my face
Whenever it appears anywhere even ????
Contrary to most, I'm not hear to play
My ?????????? Van Gogh they got no ear to waste
I'll build my spaceship till I'm light years away
And my singles is hittin in Britain more than Jamiroquai's

(Chorus)


[3rd Verse]
See i don't brag I joke but even when I boast the most craziest stuff I'm only half lying
???? with a gift jus spittin at kids and amidst the madness in March I'm pickin brackets
With the best or so, call professionals
On top of being bless with flows and exceptional breath control
Peace to those
That express ???
I'm extraterrestrial outta this world type ?????
Killin rappers with a smile on
Spittin free styles ????
Runnin round these dudes like they ????
Uuhh shook, these rappers need to stay up in my good books...

(Chorus)
