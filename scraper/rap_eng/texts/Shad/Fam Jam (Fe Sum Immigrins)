[Intro: Shad & (Shad's Aunt)]
(I'm proud of my nephew)
Yeah
(I'm proud of my nephew, my niece)
Yeah, well, no, mostly the nephew, this is focusing on the nephew
(Especially the one in Toronto)
Yeah, this is the one

[Verse 1]
(Not bad huh, for some immigrants)
From donated clothes, to caps and gowns
It's a little shout to my black and brown
Folks that know the game, not in class to clown
Had the funny accent, look who's laughing now
See Samir came here to grind, and he slaved at
Every minimum wage job, but he saved that
Brought his sis through on scholarship to make stacks
Working as a surgeon she bought a whip, and payed cash
No time to whine, we just face facts
Let's fit 6 in the back and let's take that
To the best restaurants, make reservations
Since we out here, since they made reservations for
First Nations and they never made reparations
The Natives probably relate more to immigration
So just for y'all too, and I can't forget the Haitians
Here for an education, it's a celebration

[Verse 2:]
To the guys that draw lines and make the borders real
But then bend the rules when there's more to drill
Don't turn away the stateless, think of the waste
If one in 3 refugees is a Lauryn Hill
Come along way, you can move forward still
From the poorest to up by Lawrence or Forest Hill
But more than that, skrillery banks just chill
Make a home, just build in a zone, less ill
In a place to be safe, few found an escape route
Where we come from, so we grateful to Jesus
And now the top is the next stop, this drop
Oughtta have my Aunts on the guest spot, red hot
I'm talking going from sweatshops to tech stocks
Doctors Without Borders, with dreadlocks
We quoting S.Dot Carter on Otis
Turns out some fresh off the boat kid wrote this
...Not bad

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Check it out
Now when you're Third World born, but First World formed
Sometimes you feel pride, sometimes you feel torn
See my Mother's tongue is not what they speak where my Mother's from
She moved to London with her husband when their son was 1
And one time after Family Ties, I turned on the news and saw my family die
(Why?) Pops said there's murder in the motherland
Things about colonialism I didn't understand
All the things that shape a man in his mind state;
A community income, and crime rate
If times change, why my people still in dire straits
If it's a big world, show me where's my place
In it, I had to talk to Pops for a minute
He said, "Shad, this world wasn't home to begin with
Just keep defending the oppressed, take steps
And keep rapping, you might just be the best"
Well, yes

[Hook]
