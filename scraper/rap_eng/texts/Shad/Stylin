[Intro: Saukrates]
Just vibin'...
We wilin'...
We stylin'...

[Verse 1]
Check it out, I'm just spitting that for the love of spitting rap
Hits like Nickelback singing with The Diplomats
Written by Max Martin swinging with the whiffle bat
Hear the pistol blast then I hit the track
Running like a Kenyan cause I’m Kenyan, ask my mama
Yeah I’m running like a Kenyan see I’m running like Obama
On that ticket, this is wicked as that Broadway play with the witches in it
Tell me who’s the sickest, kid I’m putting on a clinic, listen
You don’t know about really touching the lyrics
So touching when I’m touching on any subject I’m fearless
They can’t stomach it, I’m loving it munching nuggets in Paris
See the throne? That’s my zone, don’t let me even get near it
Please, I’m ahead of my time, wait, now I’m ahead of the times
Sped up ahead of the beat, speaking of time whenever I head to the meet
I’m always ahead of the heat, head of my class egg head with glasses
Leaving these heads with a classic, now let me just head to the back
Lay my head down and nap for a bit

[Hook: Saukrates]
Please, we just vibin', next thing ya know we wilin'
(Yeah) we (we) stylin' people weaker might get violent
(Yeah) we (we) vibin' next thing ya know we wilin'
(Yeah) we (we) stylin' people weaker might come off

[Verse 2]
Yo, I know you used “Keep Shinin” to chop chicks, don’t lie yo!
I know geeks rhyming that soft ish is the hotness right now
You refined and you all slick, talking français some
“Je suis dining with chopsticks”
You’re sly dog, and you’re from Africa right?
That’s amazing. That’s really great, fascinating
See I got fans that say “Oh hey Shad, I hate rap but I like you,”
Well I hate that, but I like you at least I like that you
Like me so I won’t spite you, it’s not your fault you’re a white dude
Likes white music I like too, just don’t be surprised by my IQ
Please, it's like back in high school they said “highbrow”
I said, “hi who?” That Shakespeare, that’s a haiku
I liked Hiero so I was like dude that’s basic
That’s like crude but you’re old placed to my iTunes
Use your common sense, matter fact use Common Sense
For that matter use Ice Cube, don’t think that we nice too
Cus we don’t look like you, cus we don’t know how to tie ties
And our grandparents weren’t tycoons? Please, lemme finish my Thai Food

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I see these kids tryna network, NBC
Plaque and master’s in the same week? NBD
I’m still marching to the same beat: MPC
I just feel like I see the same tweets and MP3s
I guess we not in the same league, MVP
Guess that means we’re in the same league, but I’m 23
That’s LeBron, that’s Jordan either way I'm the best draft: MGD
If I’m not in the dot, find me in BC
East Van is the riding I’m the MPP
Cus I really run that party, not the NDP
I’m playing NPG, Prince and 10cc
They say the kids got balls by the plenty, B
Sax like Kenny G, any key
Kings like Akeem and Semmi be
The hottest, they keep talking like they got it I’m like, let me see
