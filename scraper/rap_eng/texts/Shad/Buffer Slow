I'm dipped in the fits of a younger me
Same snap back
Same mustard jeans
I rock the same kicks as back in grade 6
And Instagram: same look when we take flicks
Still running. but what from?
If Neil's still singing, then whats young?
Whats age if it's not a number?
It's the day you got paid and you lost your hunger
Left your dreams in bed
Made it and tossed em under
And you forgot about your Troy and your Sasha Thumper
That's the day you stopped living and you started dying
I'm in a buffalo stance with the heart of a lion
I keep a porch light on on these warm nights
For looking back on the path and for foresight
It's strange now i got a logo and a name
One eye on a photo in a frame as we change
