Yah beautiful, dangerous season the fall of youth
Souls wither, like gold diggers we follow suit
The booth is starting to feel small
I should feel appalled, instead I feel it all and can't call it
My heroes have the heart to lose the life I wanna live
In the end I'm hoping that I take less than I give
We go through stages, I ain't talking bout gigs
And I ain't talking 'bout famous when I talk about big
Pathetic poetics, connect my life to my words
Some cause play-back pain right to the nerves
For me it's hard to hear (that you're hard of hearing)
Didn't believe I was def till some checks started clearing
Now that's a different kind of clarity
And love for your brother, that's a different kind of charity
Ya I rap fearlessly, but I act carelessly
When I'm busy on my grizzly, I'm a quarter bi-polar bear with me
The rarest breed, naw, I'm just a parakeet
I talk what I hear, I do as they do and I hate what I fear you see
A simple animal sin is sincerity
But when I get carried away, you carry me
