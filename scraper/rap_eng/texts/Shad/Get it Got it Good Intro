So the whole world was at war
That young boy became one of the snipers
And there were the revolutionaries and the establishment
And the stone throwers and other factions clashing
And then there was this one fearless foolish guy that just didn't believe in the power of bullets
He just didn't believe that they had the power to take a life
And so he just walked around with no weapon
