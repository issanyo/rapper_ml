Frankie Vyrus:
We brawled, I failed my bars in vain
I start fuckery "Oh my"
I missed, I blame the judge Nigel
Im fucked up I can't even describe

Shad:
"Don't you ever sway I just dropped a bait
I will always haunt you
You can't even rhyme, Im into your wife
I will always haunt you"

Frankie Vyrus:
I came in like Im spreading germs
I cannot hit so hard in brawls
All I want now is to press the "STOP"
All it ever did was wreck me
Yeah, it, it wreck me

Frankie Vyrus:
I hold my thigh up to the sky
And now, nobodys gon' pound
Im lowkey cryin, Ive slowly turned
Into some bitch from the dog pound

Shad:
"Don't you ever sway I just dropped a bait
I will always haunt you
You can't even rhyme, Im into your wife
I will always haunt you"

Frankie Vyrus:
I came in like Im spreading germs
I cannot hit so hard in brawls
All I want now is to press the "STOP"
All it ever did was wreck me
Yeah, it, it wreck me

Frankie Vyrus:
I never meant to duck the bout
All I wanted is to pussy out
And instead of using bars
I kept runnin and bitching

Frankie Vyrus:
I came in like Im spreading germs
I cannot hit so hard in brawls
All I want now is to press the "STOP"
All it ever did was wreck me
Yeah, it, it wreck me
