I hate funerals, I love life. I hate when I see a whole bunch of people just crying
In a funeral on some fake shit. They ain’t really love a nigga while they was there
See I’m a different type of nigga, I wanna be honest with y'all. I need the love
Now, if y’all motherfuckers gonna be crying and playing thirty minute specials when
I’m gone (an hour special that I’m gone) fuck that, love me while I’m here. Love me
While I’m here, I had to tell a bitch


[Hook]
(I want the love)
‘Cause all I see is haters and this money got these niggas catchin’ verbals and I tell ya
(I want the love)
‘Cause all I know is getting money, knockin’ at the door, I’m like who is it? Bitch I tell ya
(I want the love)
