[Verse 1]
Yo, I don't really like to, but, um
Yo, I don't really like to, but, um
I put the smack down like it's rehab
Make sure that there's no relapse with these cats
Y'all cowards couldn't rap this dope with a Zig Zag
I let my lips drag, spitting with that big swag
It's sad all these wannabes
Wanted to be Jay then K. West, wanna be
Star of the Roc, kid, you're not Sean Connery
But like The Rock I'm surrounded by watery flows
Still it really don't bother me
Fake ballers, weak game, less polished than Ben Wallace's while I breed
Quality music getting quality spins
Y'all stay second rate Chingys at the Quality Inn
Now that's a joke to a real rapper
I could decrease the skill factor and I'd still make you feel whacker
Ah gee, now you got me cocky
Cats say, "You the illest," I'm like, "Nah b, nah b, nah b"
Well OK, probably, but that's just only cause I rap like it's my hobby
Not a jobby-job all sloppy, getting off-key
Y'all Mad as March trying to knock off the top seed
I'm in the mix like Roxy
So hot he even get props from neo-Nazis
Now I don't really like to
Yo, I don't really like to
I don't really like to

[Verse 2]
I don't like to start verses with I, y'know, but, um
ITunes, eye-patch, I'm in the same boat where the pirates be
Tell 'em I'm down with that pirate steed
They don't buy it, I say don't buy it, pirate me
If it's ill, it'll spread virally from my received
Folders to appearing in the love that the crowds show
If it sound dope, keep it on the download
Keep it real, player, with the volume cranked
And I'll be balling like Tim Duncan, calling bank
Cash banked it, but the bank said
That my check's been bouncing like the bankhead
So I'm bad like credit while they bear styles
More plain than the air miles
Borrowed metaphors from mega-stores to get rewards
We get 'em open automatic like the exit doors
And take a step higher, y'all just gotta press the floor
And step out, in faith, it's OK to confess doubt
Knowing how it feels to be stressed out
Tribe called Mapquest-style poems I sketch out
To find the best route home, don't
Live in your dome for too long
You end up like that Tiffany song, thinking we're alone
We all get older, we don't all get grown
Cause some of y'all don't really like to
Y'all don't really like to
Y'all don't really like to
Y'all don't really like to
