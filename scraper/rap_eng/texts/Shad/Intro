[Intro: ~Woman~ {*talking*}]
Once upon a time there was an old prince*
And this old prince had a problem
And his problem was that...well...he was an old prince
Princes aren't supposed to be old
Princes are supposed to grow up and become kings
Brother please
No more Pamela Lee's let's set it straight
I'm the biggest thing out of Canada
Til Quebec separate
And I never medicate
So y'all feel me if I'm ill
Like a lump
Some dudes used to burn down trees and now they stumped
By the simplest questions
And everything they think is deception
As they sink in depression
No telling where our life's headed
I'm light-headed
From stress, where I write/right hooks like a fight method
Like credit I'm indebted for my misuse
My life is like a magazine, got so many issues
God edits the stories
Still tryin' to find the father like Maury
He ain't with the stars like Tori Spelling's
Spell is out like N.O.R.E. on a quest for glory
On a quest for glory
On a...
Yo
In my life and times
Writin' rhymes
Gone from being my release
To puttin' who I be in my release so
I can release it
Eventually re-coupe maybe cop a Coupe
And in a year or two re-lease it
I prolly get screwed but who read leases?
Legal jargon, people bargain
I'll prolly keep the car and
Hope it don't crash/Crash like Don Cheadle
Starrin' with these non-peaceful hearts
And minds with strong egos
That only see what they want to see like on TiVO
Darlin'
I gotta maintain just in my own way (chill)
We gon' play these snakes like the phone game
And we don't say jack
Just bring it back to the facts
When it comes time to rock like the stone age
On a, on a, on a
On a quest for glory, on a quest for glory, on quest for glory
