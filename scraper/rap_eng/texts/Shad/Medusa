[Hook: Maine Rilla Stone]
Feelin' stressed free off the buddha
I'm bless with Shooters, hallelujah
Nina smoke anywhere like an Hookah
Then it's off with your head like Medusa
MEDUSA MEDUSA, MEDUSA x3
I'm a stoner, no Medusa

[Verse 1: Maine Rilla Stone]
#OUUUUUUU... #OUUUUUUU...
I'm a, bout to, turn up!
Glock 40 like police it run them out of here
Started drummin' and left his body like a rocking chair
Ralph lauren and True religion be my kind of gear
But I see the judge in red and black suits like it's solitaire
Money my addiction, Loud affect my vision
Bitches call me Maine cus' i'm they're main attention
Money my addiction, Loud affect my vision
Bitches call me Maine cus' i'm they're main attention
#OUUUUUUU

[Verse2: J Stackz]
Got the 30 on me feelin' like i'm Curry
Pussy boy I ain't got no worries
Got to show these niggas no mercy
No face, No Case, No Jury
My niggas turned stone like land of Medusa
Catch a man down yeah hallelujah
My trues yeah I know you see the Buddha
Disrespect and you get popped in your medulla
Bitches always come to me like I ain't know you rap
I'm just working, working, working nigga, yea that's a fact
Disrespect my dead homies we gonna leave your ass flat
I just want a bitch like Mimi so that bitch could throw it back #Ouuuuuu

[Verse 3: Ben G'z]
Pull up to your block n' get the dumpin'
Bullets heat 'em up like a oven
Catch the neck from his bitch than I'm fuckin'
Than pass it to the squad it ain't nothin'
Designer on my body i'm flexin'
Chopper hit your block like Tetris
Have you in a box like a message
Medusa head on me she a bad bitch
And I been getting green like cabbage
My lifestyle is way above average
Cause all my life I been a savage
We never got work so we grab it
Niggas tried to hit me up I did magic
Now it's back to the money we trappin'
Keep an extended clips for you actors
Let's get it
Keep an extended clips for you actors
