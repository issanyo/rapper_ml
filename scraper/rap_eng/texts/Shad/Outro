Yah Beautiful
Dangerous season the fall of youth
Souls wither like gold diggers, we follow suit
The booth is starting to feel small
I should feel appalled
Instead i feel it all and can't call it
My heroes have the heart to lose the life I wanna live
In the end I'm hoping that i take less than I give
We go through stages, I ain't talkin' bout gigs
And I ain't talkin bout famous when I talk about big
Pathetic poetics, connect my life to my words
Some cause play-back pain right to the nerves
For me it's hard to hear, that youre hard to hear
Didn't believe I was deaf till some check started clearin
Now thats a different kind of clarity
And love for your brother
That's a different kind of charity
Ya I rap fearlessly
But i act carelessly
When i'm busy on my grizzly
I'm a quarter bi-polar bear
With me, the rarest breed
Naw I'm just a parakeet
I talk what I hear
I do as they do
And I hate what I fear you see
A simple animal, sin is sincerity
But when I get carried away
You carry me TSOL
