[Verse 1]
Yeah, let's take flight
Let's go
Yeah, me and T back at it
Leaving mics broke, playing through the feedback static
Write dope for the weed rap addicts
Like smoke, girls breathe bad, make their whole team asthmatic
(I can't breathe!)
When they see Shad, gasping, dashing
Too fly, I swear I should wear a ski mask rapping
For them, front row at my knee caps grabbing
Uh, now you got me back bragging
Like we need that swag--OK, I don't really like to
T's in the aisle seat, tryna get a Sprite from the flight crew
Meanwhile I'm working on my night snooze
Red eye, my dudes stepping in flights like some Nike shoes
On a different runway, red-dye nice suit
Cause T got them necktie-tight loops
It's indecent how I address
For the spring season, so fresh
Go get it on your iTunes

[Hook]
Take flight
Every day, every night

[Verse 2]
The glory days, who would have thought forming at Laurier
Would correlate to touring in six countries and forty states
Early mornings on board after performing late
In a foreign place, I'm still feeling the warm embrace
Still got more to say, still clever with rhymes
Never declining, still getting better with time
I would say like wine, but I never been whining
Like never mind the weather, I'm shining
With the divine when we get in alignment
Check the devilish smile, irreverent Reverend, rebellious-minded
Saint in the flesh, that's a blessing disguised
I can get it in whenever, I'm forever as diamonds
That's coal under pressure, been a treasure to find
This flow, this soul, this heaven inside
This poet's goal is getting you high
I'm fly as Seven Wings on another level than sky

[Hook]
And that's how we take flight
