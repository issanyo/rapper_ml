[Intro: Dallas Green]
The time will come when we are all condemned for what we've done
The time will come

[Verse 1: Shad]
I say the times begun to pay for our crimes no time to run
It's sundown these days are the final ones
Looking dumbfounded staring in the eye of a gun
And we all scared to die we all fear the pallbearer
All scared to cry we all fear our salt tears
But why when we live it's so miserable
Can't get along why is forgiving so difficult
Why we live alone, what we living for is critical
Someone give some hope that's breath for our living souls
Even if your physical can't breathe stand up and lead
Me and my band of brothers advance under siege
Move towards the future the commander and chief
Plant a flag on this soul call if land of the free
Every day both rich and poor wonder what we living for

[Hook: Dallas Green]
We're gonna live forever
(What we gonna live for)
We're gonna live forever
(What we gonna live for)
We're gonna live forever
(What we gonna live for)
We're gonna live forever
(What we gonna live for)
We're gonna live
We're gonna live

[Verse 2: Shad]
You never know how your legend's gonna grow later
When we go it's our ghost that they are so afraid of
I try to flow greater cause most conscience sold food for thoughts
Like tofu: no flavor
So when I roll through it's so smooth like a pro skater
Or a boat cruise bringing change toll booth
Player thought they told you I'm old school
Student of the game let me show you a whole new grade up
All my single ladies here's a couple lines
Love takes two people love one mind
Here's one year if you give it six months
You only live once this is double time
Essentially bring the energy of Busta Rhymes
Soul doesn't die like Curtis on touch the sky

[Bridge: Dallas Green]
And when the smoke finally clears we're gonna rise above the ash
We're gonna live
We're gonna live
We're gonna live forever
(What we gonna live for)

[Hook]

[Breakdown: Shad]
Like this
I can't sweat trying to make the coolest impression
Trying to get power is a foolish obsession
Why use talent as a tool for oppression
A real king ain't got to rule with a weapon
Dog what if we went to school for possession instead of jail
They say to stop the crazy talk Shad we never will
I guess I still believe love can never fail
Cross eyes on heaven looking crazy as hell
Maybe I dwell too much on legacy, destiny
Like I could ever read whats on the headstone ahead of me
But in my head I see we are carving the letters
Everyday that thought makes me work hard for the better
The truth comes out but it starts at the center
The heart of the matter is a matter of the heart
The heart's made of matter that you can't measure
That matters beyond measure like light when it travels in the dark
