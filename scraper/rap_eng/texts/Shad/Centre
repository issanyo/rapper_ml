[Intro: Shad]
Centre of the centre of the Earth
Enterin' the entrance of a birth
Remember to remember is to enter in reverse
To the centre of the centre of the centre of the dot, then disperse
Rubber like circles in a band from a dot, from a drop
To the circles that surround ya
In the water, make waves that we drown in
Waves of sound that we bathe in
Then wash up on this ground that
Ground that we all stand on
That we all stand for
To process, that we hang on
Hang on, hang on, hang on
Like dot, dot, dot

[Verse 1: Shad]
It's like a rock dropped in the water
Submerged, but first reverberates
Like words that makes circle shapes
Circles like, like records that revolve
With grooves that rest and unrest
And then resolve when they drop
Little dots like drops of sand
From a clock spanning across a canyon
Across plots of land, like clocks
All we gots is hands to bang together
These plots and plans and pots and pans and

[Hook 1: Shad]
Drop some slang from the dot, dot, dot, dot, back to the top
The centre of the centre of the Earth
Enterin' the entrance of a birth
Remember to remember is to enter in reverse
To the centre of the centre of the centre of the dot, then disperse
We're dust in the wind till we're dust in the Earth
The universe's dot at the centre of the first
And the circle never stops from the first rock dropped
On forever like dot, dot, dot
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot
Dot, dot

[Verse 2: Tagaq]
Sing me a flash, catch, just the Sun to
Sing me a flash, catch, just the Sun to sacrifice
Our blood goes back into the Earth
In, out, womb, core
In, out, womb, core, womb, core
Womb, core, womb

[Hook 2: Shad]
Drop some slang from the dot, dot, dot, dot, back to the top
The centre of the centre of the Earth
Enterin' the entrance of a birth
Remember to remember is to enter in reverse
To the centre of the centre of the centre of the dot, then disperse
We're dust in the wind till we're dust in the Earth
The universe's dot at the centre of the first
And the circle never stops from the first rock dropped
On forever like dot, dot, dot
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot
Dot, dot
Dot, dot, dot

[Hook 3: Shad]
Drop some slang from the dot, dot, dot, dot, back to the top
The centre of the centre of the Earth
Enterin' the entrance of a birth
Remember to remember is to enter in reverse
To the centre of the centre of the centre of the dot, then disperse
We're dust in the wind till we're dust in the Earth
Dot, dot, dot
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot
Dot, dot
