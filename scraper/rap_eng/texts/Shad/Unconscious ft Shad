Man, I’m unconscious, every time I spit this
Feels like I just black out, feels like I’m the sickest
It feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting
Feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting
Man, I’m unconscious, every time I spit this
Feels like I just black out, feels like I’m the sickest
It feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting
Feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting

I’m trying to go from in your cellar to interstellar, I mean that
Make a switch and put my reality where my dreams at
London’s little Nemo, I’m one with the writing, people
Just run when I’m like this, heightened, speaking in tongues that are likely lethal
Unconscious, it’s constant; I can’t escape it
I’m a rappist, plus I’m rabid cause I’m underrated
Never understated, want to be one of the greatest
One of the ones that made it, maybe, one of the ones that save it, save it how it’s saved me greatly
Don’t be surprised, you see me rap, you see me blackin out
My life’s been crazier than Cee-Lo cutting snacking out
I feel I don’t belong and I dunno what that’s about
But I don’t feel like fitting in, when everything seems acted out
My sanity is breaking up, sleep’s been taking up
More and more time, now I think I hate waking up
Ten more minutes, mom, hit sleep; then I’m gone
Tout de suite, bonne nuit, au revoir, one, peace, usually it’s one of these, and...

Man, I’m unconscious, every time I spit this
Feels like I just black out, feels like I’m the sickest
It feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting
Feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting
Man, I’m unconscious, every time I spit this
Feels like I just black out, feels like I’m the sickest
It feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting
Feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting

[Shad Verse - Coming Soon]

Man, I’m unconscious, every time I spit this
Feels like I just black out, feels like I’m the sickest
It feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting
Feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting
Man, I’m unconscious, every time I spit this
Feels like I just black out, feels like I’m the sickest
It feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting
Feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting

So every time I wake up, I’m just waiting til I go to sleep
Not overly concerned with what is owed to me, I totally
Wouldn’t complain if more people noticed me
But really I just flow for me and represent the Lo how it’s s’posed to be
Something like a planet, ain’t a star here approaching me
Or close to me unconscious, if I’m conscious then they’re overly
Outmatched, no holds barred, do with over-ease
Cause face it, most emcees are dicks with ovaries, so confused
Its nuts though, so many got nothing where the nuts go
Nothing where the guts go, either, where’s the gusto?
And I ain’t even perfect, but I’m passionate and such so
It sucks so much; that so much that blows, uploads
Hip-hop to the utmost, N.G.A
You might remember me from such shows as “Just Another Day”
Huh? Spazz out track, the black out’s back
My viewpoint’s too dark, like black on black
I got too many bills to have racks on racks
And too much pride to be that wack on tracks and...

Man, I’m unconscious, every time I spit this
Feels like I just black out, feels like I’m the sickest
It feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting
Feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting
Man, I’m unconscious, every time I spit this
Feels like I just black out, feels like I’m the sickest
It feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting
Feels like I am not from Earth, I’m just visiting
