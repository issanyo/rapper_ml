[Intro: Kamau]
I don't really know what I want
I don't really know what I need
I don't know what other people need
I feel confused a lot of the time
Not really knowing, you know in, in what direction to go
What things to do or how to, how to live my life properly
Life is interesting though, it's a bit of a search

[Verse 1: Shad]
What happens when the walls drop?
The lies and the disguises and the small talk
That cover up the pain and the shame and the bald spots
We're runaway trains, what happens when it all stops?
Artists drop gems that ring false rocks
We should've got those calls blocked like Alstott
We're feeding our mind from the tree in Eden
Lately I've been reading what Paul taught, freedom
That's what we all want, yo, that's what we all want

[Interlude: Kamau]
People look for what they want in all sorts of different things
Um, and they often neglect the things that they need in life
You know there are a couple of basic things that I think most of us want
Even if we're not completely aware of the fact that we want those things
And I don't know how to communicate that to people
Usually it's just something that you learn in time

[Verse 2: Relic The Oddity]
I wanna be on a level of skill that's gold medal, but still
I'm unsettled like clogs man, those are some hard shoes to fill
Especially when the pressure's on and the mic is off
Me and my wife just struggle to pay bills
And keep our son occupied and
Make his stocking filled when the holidays arrive
I try to be a good provider, successful on the spiritual side
But made a mess when it came to my debts
Now let's take a lesson from it
I stand on the summit of sums that reflect the lesser things that I've wanted
In life, I don't want to be haunted by my decisions
I'll admit balancing wants and needs comes with a price
And I'm paying it twice, first with the cards
Second with the interest, it ain't that nice
I've been blessed so I think I know what's right
What I really want is peace from God and insight
It's what we all want, right?

[Interlude: Kamau]
It's messed up because sometimes we want things
That are completely opposite of what we need
In fact a lot of the time in the world today
You find people searching for and seeking out things
That are terrible for them

[Verse 3: Shad]
Yo its hard to be, man it's hard to just be
Especially with this artistry, it's hard to be
Black and not be a hard emcee or r&b
And that's cool if that's you but what if all you are is me?
Man, start the beat cause all my heart can see is a dark and bleak
Night sky painted on my mind so I spark this speech
Like stars to bleed, light when it's hard to see
More than guitars and being down with a label that can market me
I've scarred my knees, praying hard for peace
Of mind and a heart that's free
Cause yo, that's what we all want
