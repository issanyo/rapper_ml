[Hook]
Even if they don’t seem what they oughta be
I just let it go down
Now I can make em see to the heart of me (y’all know me)
And I let it go down
If they don’t seem what they oughta be
I just let it go down
I can make em see to the heart of me (y’all know me)
And I let it go down

[Verse 1]
(How should I begin, um..)
What’s a winner? What’s this bitterness?
It’s crazy how we fight like Springer
No Fight Night, it’s not a game (give'r)
I’m a globetrotter but not a baller or ball-spinner
On this big ball spinning up on God’s tall fingers
All year, aw yea, spring, summer, fall, winter
Remembering the saint that remembered we’re all sinners
Let my people go! (uhh Pharaoh they're talking to us)
Rosa’s still seated, saying “please don’t get off of the bus”
It’s history, never her story and prophets get crushed
Tough topics get hushed and life is often unjust
I forget.. then I remember to remember
On the darkest days, the sun is still shining in December
Being broke, yeah that’s hard, but that legal ain’t always tender
I’m Hakeem’s team focused with my dream in the center, let’s move

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now I’m just trying to make it do what it should (never!)
Can Wesley Snipes get a Leslie Feist, what’s good?
I’m on a little win streak yo
Jeremy Linnin', Tim Tebow
How many them negro men can spend c-notes?
Love be infinito, bring me that passion, that black Jim Caviezel
I’m trying to be acting like he’s really coming back in the sequel
Really rap for the people
We can do this music for half of the ego but
Cats been gassed before Shad added diesel fuel
To fire but one strike to the match can be lethal
They say a bit of the fast life’s addictive
As a hit from a crack pipe
The trap’s, like, hidden like slipping that night on some black ice
Makes people backbite, even backstab best friends with a jackknife
B I'm in that fight, given miserable odds, fighting with self
In a scrap between business and art
I been given some scars, can’t give in, still giving ‘em bars
Spit from the heart and I’ll rip ‘em apart

[Hook]
