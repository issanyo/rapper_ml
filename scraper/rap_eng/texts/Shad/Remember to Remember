[Verse 1]
Yeah, I forget so often, God, no wonder I feel lost
When I forget where I came from or how I got past
Now we ain’t young, can’t play dumb, the fun and games is done
Damn man, it’s a strange one
Reverend what you say, run, walk this way
By the light of the same sun, that's in the sky where the rain's from
But the clouds make it hard to see him
He's in my brother I discovered that it's not that hard to be him
I just lose him in the P.M., thinking if I had a B.M
I could hang with Mona Lisas like a piece in a museum
Uh, human beings
Deep inside we decide if we free men

[Hook 1: Shad & {Lights}]
Remember to remember
{In the now}
Remember to remember
{I mean it now}
Just remember to remember
{In the now}
Remember to remember
{I see you now}

[Verse 2]
You may have to forgive him forever
Everyday they say life can make you bitter or better
I say "Hey, sacred or not it's all that we got"
Love is what it is, or maybe not what you thought
Woke up one morning started talking to pops
He said "There's lots that you've learned but a lot you forgot
More often than not you don't got to be taught
Just remember to remember how you got to the spot that's hot"
I'm happy and healthy and dreaming and dying
I'm loving and lonely and tired of trying
I’m fall and faded and failing with flying
Colours fumbling forward facing sky
My aim's to entertain and inspire
Walk through the rain and the fire, pay bills keep sane and retire
From the game with a name that's admired
Seeing the stars and aiming higher

[Hook 2: Shad & {Lights}
Remember to remember
{In the now}
Remember to remember
{I feel it now}
Remember to remember
{In the now}
Remember to remember
{I need it now}
Remember to remember
{In the now}
Yeah
{I feel it now}
Remember to remember
{In the now}
Break it down like this...
{I mean it now}

[Verse 3]
Now I ain't ever really been one for image
Ain't trying to fool the public with some stunts and gimmicks
Guys gravitate to blunts and Guinness to get the courage to fight the urge
In 'em, not to succumb to timidness
And this world is fully overrun with mimics
With a penchant for overexposing guns and women
Few deals, funds is limited, folks front to get in the game
That ain't kind, everyone's a critic
But this ain't a race to win, it's a run to finish
And as long as I got breath in my lungs to end it
The enemy isn't the flesh and blood thugs and cynics
We fighting fear and pride for the love within us

[Hook 2]
Remember
{In the now}
Remember to remember
{I see you now}
Remember to remember
{In the now}
Remember to remember
{I feel it now}
Remember to Remember
{I feel it now}
Remember to Remember
{I feel it now}
Remember to Remember
{I feel it now}
Remember to Remember

[Instrumental section—a cappella samples]

[Verse 4]
Break it down, the poor struggle with needs
The rich struggle with greed, this camel struggle to squeeze
Through the eye of a needle, some eyes struggle to see
But we all struggle for freedom
Instead of freeing each other by letting ourselves be
Yeah, and it never ends
We only feel better when we feel like we’re better than
Clever men and our violence
Silence is when we shoot from the lip too quiet
Then we talk non-violence and stay silent when it suits
Really, it’s all violence at the root
The same James Wilks in the booth, but tyrants aren’t tyrants in the group
Who started the shooting? Who knows?
We were all just born inside of this truth
Taught to shoot as youth, taught as just humans being human
But the truth is the truth is bulletproof

[Outro]
