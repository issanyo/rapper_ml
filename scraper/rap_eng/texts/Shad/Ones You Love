Choose the ones you love and the ones that love you
Colour my forgiveness bright blue

Choose the ones you love and the ones that love you

Choose the ones you love and the ones that love you
Colour my forgiveness bright blue

Choose the ones you love and the ones that love you

I can still hear her there
Wearing a sad blue crown
Listening to good records
Talking trash

Choose the ones you love and the ones that love you
Choose the ones you love and the ones that love you
In the quiet I still here you
Choose the ones you love
In the darkness I still see you
Choose the ones you love
Every crooked smile on my face I've lied through
And the ones that love you
