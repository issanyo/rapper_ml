[Verse 1]
Before I take a mic, take a break beat or a break to write
Break me down Lord please and shape my life
We need leaders, these elitists got nothing to teach us
By they strength, our children need to see Jesus in their weakness
And keep seeking where free speech is rare
And realness gets kept less frequent than these secrets, share
A couple stories like a town home or brownstone
Over loud phones about my hang ups and dial tones
Swim in heaven and at worst you get drowned toe’d
Down to the place where the clouds roam
So we get up, all my people feeling bored and strange
If you don’t feel at home in this conformist state
Then don’t ignore the pain, that’s the Lord that’s saying
To you, "Stand up king, you were born to reign"
That’s the war that’s waged and the important thing
Ain't what you'd die for, it's what you live for today
We need to

[Hook]
Get up
Even if they knock us down
They can't can't stop us, smile right back at 'em
Laugh and then get up
Actions speak louder than a thousands talkers
So make 'em blast that in their Walk Mans
[x2]

[Verse 2]
It's hard to stand in a nation where the masses sit idle and passionless
Politics is polls, in the papers all the facts are skipped
Can't ascertain so the scholars place an asterisk
And stories on the stars to dumb down and distract us with
We can't help but feel detached from this capitalist
Confusing communion of corporate sponsors and advocates
Where every actor is an activist
But a movie cast won't fix these broken homes full of fractured kids
Aren’t broken bones you can wrap up quick
Folks trying to master this game that I call money for masochists
Where if you wanna make a cut, gotta match their risk
Dig in your pockets, not for cash but to slash your wrists
And fashion’s just a game of who can follow fads fastest
Wish some kind of miraculous world change can happen quick
But these problems don’t take seconds to solve
And getting mad ain't the same thing as getting involved
We need to

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Get a mic, get skill, get ice, get bills
Get the life that you always wanted and then get killed
Get slain, cause the rappers that do get fame
Is insane, all they talk about is who should get blamed
Young brothers get steel before they get aim
And they wanna get it pulled before they get trained
Cause they wanna get respect, get checks, get dames
Things we all wanna get but end up getting drained
Trying to get 'em, we get stressed and we get strained
We don’t all get the ghetto but we all get pain
Before I get to the refrain, I hope you get what I'm saying
It's messed, but we just might get some change if we

[Hook]
