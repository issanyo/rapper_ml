[Verse 1: Shad]
I can't derail I train hard then relax on tracks
Keep the brain sharp hitting like an axe on wax
Axe never touch trees meaning I don't puff weed
But I hope to plant my seeds before I must leave
Believing that hope grows even in the stone cold
Bitter and bleak old souls sold like it's antique
Road show except for so damn cheap
They preach the new science clone the program sheep
But they won't find us, it's hide and go seek
To control minds like gold mines in Mozambique
Where the folks can't eat so I stroll to a slow jam beat
Slow dancing life's no grand prix
No race no pace car and there's no shortcuts
And no one's that special, there ain't no short bus
The core of us are simple, but dignified
We don't simply live to die
Look through the inner eye in the sky

[Verse 2: Shad]
Now I'm a cynic but I try to keep my heart warm
Human beings start war, but I believe in peace even for Darfur
From hardcore to humor to here
Where we stare in confusion at a future so near
Got to take the spec out of your eye to see clear
And if I'm gonna point fingers better point them at the mirror
Reflections I reflect on lessons of my 26th year
Erecting this next song here
See y'all know the drill like Exxon
I guess wrong moves is experience like stairs to step on (yeah)
And I don't talk biz and I don't talk down
No kids talk, but I don't talk big
Getting gassed like pop fizz off of pop hits
I ain't got to say real talk because all my talk is
Pop quiz: Who can define love?
So many blind plus they can't feel they'll never find us...

[Verse 3: Kamau]
My folks love me I feel lucky they all love me
But feel funny inside of world that's real ugly
God save us this hard labour is breaking backs
In the sands of time every step we making tracks
The hour glass is lasting faster than the hour last
Or so it seems more dreams they will come to pass
And nightmares they flare up like the flames erupt
The same dream I used to live now I gave it up
And I've been saving up but money doesn't come quick
Comes and goes like the daylight one shift
And one sip of the well water it makes us live
Forever we still here whether we take or give
And it's survival of the fittest by the thinnest thread
When father time moves the minutes what is in his head
Not even in control of what we must become
But not far so I guess we are the lucky ones
