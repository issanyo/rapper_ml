[Intro: Shad]
Yeah, yeah, check it

[Verse 1]

[Shad]
Love, I get so lost
Lost as Matthew Fox
Sad dude in a bad mood rising
Bad mood, feeling down, bad music
Call him in neptunes, seeing sounds
Down like a running back needed ground
Bit my tongue, bleeding mouth
Got red dripping on my new sneaks
Slipped on my two feet, toes in the air
I'm living on a nude beach
And everybody here's on a two piece while my soul's bare
Boobies spelled on a calculator...

[Relic The Oddity]
True School rapper with middle school humor
Old School like Will Ferrel with no school tutor, real
It's not a tumor, that was a flat out rumor
My head never swelled, but you assume the
Ballooned mind-state will inflate into my space
At a high rate, it makes me irate
My module is lunar and he's a tune up
Makes it hard to drive straight
Imagining gravity-defying happenings installed under my driveways
Parked sideways for more than four out of five days
The other two have slipped up, ablaze
Now twist-up, the high-grade, my mind mixed-up
And phased out my faith and turned it into doubt, I'm out

[Hook]
We are the ones, that you are not
You are the ones, we will never be now

[Verse 2]

[Shad]
Yeah, it's the, Mister North of the 49, spit up
The sort of rhymes, you can borderline picture
Story time, Slick Rick meets Mordechai Richler
On point like a porcupine prickler

[Relic The Oddity]
Yeah, I put it down, break ground like quakes
Shake your beaker off the scale overweight
Heavy-hitter with the switch-stance, 34 waist
Always drop on the buttons and I'm staying in shape

[Shad]
And I'm Shad, you can add a "K" if you wish to
Official scatterbrain, East of Adelaide I miss you
I get live like Saturday Night, no issue
Now that's all that I have to say, Rizzle who is you?

[Relic]
Now I'm the mystery hidden in the riddle within the puzzle
Dealing with the issues on delivery, critical
I'm quick, on the uptake Relic fits rally
On the status updates, we're the ones you must rate cause

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Shad]
Got a nice lady, take her out for a nice meal like veal
Or maybe baby seal (Clubbing?)
Nah, too loud and too crowded
It's not 2009, B
I ain't 19, I ain't waiting in no line, please
It's boring as pouring over rhyme schemes
And cats grinding, trying to be the last sign like Pisces
I'm not Chinese, but I like me some light chi iced tea with pearls
Find me on a nice beach doing Tai Chi with girls
And it's likely that I might see the world off of rapping these bars
It's a trick passing these stars
In a casting call for the acting captain in charge
I'm the black Captain Picard
Sergeant of the rebel army
Charming as a devil with hustle on the level of
Barney Rubble on Red Bull
A vessel at the end of the day, I'm not the bee's knees
Only need knees to bend them to pray
Break bread with the saints
For the sake of having bread during the wake
This here's a full-time work group
And virtue is on-and-off in the church pew
Search and you find before this verse through
Find the merch booth spend some time (ow!)

[Hook]
