[Intro: Woman talking]
Once upon a time there was an old prince
And this old prince had a problem
And his problem was that... Well... He was an old prince
Princes aren't supposed to be old
Princes are supposed to grow up and become kings

[Verse 1: Shad]
Brother please, no more Pamela Lee's, let's set it straight
I'm the biggest thing out of Canada till Quebec separate
And I never medicate, so y'all feel me if I'm ill
Like a lump, some dudes used to burn down trees
And now they stumped by the simplest questions
And everything they think is deception as they sink in depression
No telling where our life's headed, I'm light-headed
From stress, where I write hooks like a fight method
Like credit I'm indebted for my misuse
My life is like a magazine, got so many issues
God edits the stories
Still trying to find the father like Maury
He ain't with the stars like Tori
Spelling, spell it out like N.O.R.E
On a quest for glory, on a quest for glory
On a quest for glory, on a...

[Verse 2: Shad]
Yo, in my life and times, writing rhymes gone from being my release
To putting who I be in my release so
I can release it, eventually recoup
Maybe cop a Coupe and in a year or two re-lease it
I probably get screwed but who read leases?
Legal jargon, people bargain, I'll probably keep the car and
Just hope it don't crash like Don Cheadle starring
With these non-peaceful hearts and minds with strong egos
That only see what they want to see like on TiVo
Darling, I gotta maintain just in my own way (chill)
We gon' play these snakes like the phone game
And we don't say jack, just bring it back to the facts
When it comes time to rock like the stone age
On a, on a, on a
On a quest for glory, on a quest for glory
On a quest for glory, on a quest for glory
On a...
