The rage is back...Shad K

You know the Dream Team right? I'm like 8 of 'em
But my squad doesn't rep the States - Canadian
Record breaks I'm slaying them I'm detonating stadiums
When I step on stage, weapons grade uranium
Look why I always gotta remind? I'm the one you always gotta rewind
Anything I spit top of the line. Watching Black Thought taught me to rhyme
I'm not Philly but I' playing like I'm Doc in his prime
I don't play though, really got a spot on the pine
Spotted with dimes eating sushi with a bottle of wine
College educated models saying call them at 9
I might holla but the kid got a lot on his mind
The definition of deaf, I bomb on walls with the infinite fresh
To be honest, see, I listen to Stress
See my father's Bambaataa don't give him a test
To send the best, that's synonymous with wishing for death
Dog, I'm the kinda rhymer that could grip up a check
From Guam to China, I'm as sick as it gets
You don't want the drama, I could rip up a set
While looking calmer than that Dalai Lama kid from Tibet
Now let me look you in the face if you just took two
And I could ruin you with rhymes I could hook you with the bass
That dope, I could hook you with a taste
No hook dude, bars enough to put you in your place, B
Lazy rappers I just shook you into shape see
What a crazy rapper could do with a break beat
How come you ain't cooking any cake, g? Nobody can't book you any dates
Meanwhile we back in France cause they want more
Encore, on tour, constantly on board concourse
Rap around y'all, call these contours
You don't run the city get raw like Rob Ford

The rage is back... Shad K

Lazy rappers I just shook you into shape see
