Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
And your wish is my command
Why can't I just make my baby understand?

[ Verse 1 - Shad ]
I never knew a love like this
If you know my songs you know how my love life is
Moon you're my one light when the sunlight dips
And you only get one night
I mean one life, one love, whatever
The one that got away, I got a few
Never been to heaven but I always got a view
With a misfortune and now I got a you
And I never felt so...
It's like hell froze
Icebox in my heart you made it melt though
When I'm on the road when I'm on the cellphone
We stick together like Velcro
My dear, what a pair, like some shell toes
And speaking of Adidas
Maybe one day you'll carry my fetus
If he had your genes he'd be a genius
Even as son or a daughter hotter than phoenix
Hot as Venus, my earth, my teammate
On my dream team
My D Wade
Makes me wanna be brave be great
Even keep in shape eat less BK
So yes DJ keep playing these breaks
So I can keep saying how I'm blessed these days

[ Verse 2 - Cadence Weapon ]
Make my baby understand
You won't see me downtown in the elephant skins
Or in ensconced in the bars with the elegant friends
Or crossed up with the garms and the relevant trends
????? discourse and intelligent things
You will see me in the parts where you are
I moved uptown so I wouldn't live far
You passed on astrology, wouldn't see the stars
And to you it didn't matter that I didn't have a car
Or a bike or a mic on open at the bar
Not trying to leave you all broken in the heart
Listen what I'm telling you baby, that's a par
And I'm good with your fractures and scars
No fool
I'm old school
I wanna introduce you to my whole crew
Every show we're going to
I'll pass you a cold brew
I wanna take you to my mom's
Eat soul food
You're so cool

[ Outro - Sample (Irfane) ]
Listen baby
Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
That your wish is my command
What can I do to make my baby understand
Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
That your wish is my command

Baby won't you understand
That your wish is my command
(I can see us there)
Baby won't you understand
(This I do declare)
That your wish is my command
