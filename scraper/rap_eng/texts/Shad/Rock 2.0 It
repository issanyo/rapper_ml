Rock 2.0 it. Eh

[Hook]
Rock rock to it, a freak freak to it, to the beat to it, it's unique music
Rock rock to it, a freak freak to it, to the beat to it this is how we do it

[Verse 1]
They say to make our best up. Nah I gotta make a best [???]
Period. Bring heat, and be the best lyricist
Take the best beating. Beat it 'till it bleeds
Fast and furious. Kill it like a cat that's curious
Furry kittens getting capped and burried . I'm kidding
But on the track I'm that serious. Sick as bacteria
So you wanna holler 'bout some dollars, but I'm not convinced
Put your money where your mouth is, and talk some sense
I'm talking [???]. I'm talking what the prophets been
Saying since the dawn of time. Put down a rhyme
Even back a couple years ago when
I was getting no spins. Notes in the note bin saying
That the Old Prince something like a coke [fiend?]
That much dope in one sitting. Heads overdose
And who cut to the bone like cold winds
I never flowed; I dove. I goes in
For close friends that got love and show it
I had to rock 2.0 it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My blog buzz is at an all time height
I'm in the prime of my online life
Every site getting hyped by the megabyte
The net is like you couldn't see Shad with hella Skype
Whatever, right?
