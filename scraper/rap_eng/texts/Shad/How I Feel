[Verse  1  -  Leonard  Sumner:]
Well  I  could  never  imagine  the  pain  that  the  mother  saw
When  life  takes  a  turn  for  the  worst  and  creators  all
Becomes  another  canvas  that  will  never  be  completed
I’m  a  few  degrees  away  and  a  thousand  times  defeated
My  energy  is  depleted
But  I  wanna  stand  and  fight
So  we  can  move  the  spirit  instead  travel  back  into  the  light
I  feel  the  fears  and  depression
Fears  and  aggression
Woven  into  society  from  years  of  oppression
The  violence  is  normalized
The  silence  is  horrifying
Truth  is  denied  and  the  fact  is  more  are  dying
You  don’t  have  to  tell  me  how  you  feel
Cause  I  can  hear  it  in  your  cries

[Verse  2  –  Shad:]
It’s  hard  to  listen,  but  listen
Cause  it’s  much  harder  living  it  than  listening  to  the  hardships
Still  the  heart's  conditioned  to  condition  the  air
When  they  air  their  conditions,  keep  cool  But  the  more  tears,  sometimes  the  clearer  the  vision
Now  what  I  see,  been  a  long  time  coming
The  Tribe,  running,  rocking,  reaching  new  peaks
So  them  youngins  can  finally  summit
Climbin  high  above  and  then  flying  from  it,  up  to  the  skies
Overstanding  the  corruption  and  deconstructing  the  lies
I’ve  seen  this  country  decline
Trying  to  keep  discussions  confined
Hide  the  underside
Over-extract  and  try  to  undermine
Damn,  but  I  still  believe  in  the  truth
Whether  it’s  an  MC  in  a  booth,  or  a  PhD  in  a  suit
Yo  when  we  yelling  protest,  tell  em  the  feeling  is  peaceful
We  profess,  we  pro-testify  to  the  will  of  the  people
Tell  them  what  they  must  know
Turn  it  up  loud  when  we  bust  flows
Not  in  hushed  tones,  speaking  up,  let  the  trust  grow
Now  you  don’t  gotta  tell  me  how  you  feel
Cause  I  can  see  it  in  your  eyes
You  don’t  gotta  tell  me  that  the  pain  is  real
Cause  I  can  hear  it  in  your  cry

[Verse  3  –  Leonard  Sumner:]
Well,  it’s  the  type  of  heartbreak  that  takes  more  than  tears  and  time  to
Stitch  up  any  wounds  and  heal  the  scars  they  leave  behind
Separation  from  the  fam,  segregation  on  the  land
It  was  all  part  of  the  plan  and  the  blood  is  on  your  handsIt’s  all  divide  and  conquer
Colonize  and  slaughter  Stabbing  at  the  heart  through  the  backs  of  our  grandfathers
Now  we  see  our  daughters  that  are  disappearing  quickly
Say  it’s  through  the  cracks  while  ignoring  all  the  history
Governments  be  scooping  babies  way  before  the  60s
When  you  legalize  abduction,  you  legalize  the  misery
So  now  you  see  the  mystery,  is  really  not  too  complicated
Justice  isn’t  equally  distributed  in  my  observation
Money  could  be  made,  while  the  kids  are  steady  isolated
And  splitting  up  a  family  has  now  become  an  occupation
And  it’s  been  part  of  the  occupation  since  residential  schools  enforced  starvation
It’s  a  nation  with  racism  here  since  the  start  of  it
Hard  to  let  go  cause  it’s  carved  in  the  heart  of  it
Relation  to  the  land  and  our  rise  were  a  part  of  it
Roots  where  I  stand,  I  could  never  depart  from  it
And  you  don’t  have  to  tell  me  how  you  feel
Cause  I  can  see  it  in  your  eyes
And  they  don’t  have  to  prove  to  me  that  the  pain  is  real
Cause  I  can  hear  it  in  their  cries
