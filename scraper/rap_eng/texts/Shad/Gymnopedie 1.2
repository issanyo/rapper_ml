[Verse 1: Shad]
Growing upwards
I was just another young brother in the suburbs
I discovered that I loved words
As a teenager in the 90s green pager, Nautica jacket, Nia Long screensaver
Had the newest slang down pack, Boomerang soundtrack
Playing in my room playing hoops laying down raps
Swore I would get to the point
3 albums later I’m like Biggie singing to fans “gimme one more chance”
Forgive me I wanna get it right and get busy
My record gets spins and in turn I get dizzy
You know the drill spin and tryna dig deep
Just past six feet touch that mystery
I misread the signs and I find myself lost
But I only know I was lost when I find myself
When I can see I wonder why I blind myself
I know I just forget to remind myself
This is rap for the raps fans
DeRozan on the break over breaks
This is that jam
Photo of your ex girl in the trashcan
This a CT scan of a simple black man
This that Lushlife
For those tough nights
Can’t stand up right blood types Bud Light
And metropolis is falling on top of us
Banks and the Bibles all closed so we profitless
Take a close look
At what they offer us
If you don’t dig it redefine prosperous
And that’s nothing but some common sense confidence
New classics on classical opulence

[Outro]
We gon get a little something straight here in the place to be. Don’t worry about it DJ Lee in the place to be. We gon get a little something straight here in the place to be. 1,2 1,2 1,2 How many people think Busy Bee Starski rocked the house? (cheers) I hear that in the place to be. Yea. But if y’all notice it or not, you know I heard a lot of shit you know Busy Bee is poppin shit saying he’ll take out any MC and all that. I give it to the man, he know how to rock the crowd, but when it come to having rhyme, ain't no way he can fuck around and I'mma prove that right now. In the place to be MC Kool Moe Dee the coolest of the cool can’t nobody rock like me. Remember this: Cold Crush Four in the house. My man LA sunshine in the place to be. We gon have a little fun, have a little fun. DJ Lee you think you got it together yet? One two…
