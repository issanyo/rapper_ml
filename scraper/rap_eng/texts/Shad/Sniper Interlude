[Verse 1: Shad]
I remember 17 when I was drivin' home
I realized that to be a man was to be alone
Drive, that's when I learned to Drive
Snow was fallin' all around the car
Maybe freedom is when people don't know where you are
Drive, that's when I learned to Drive
So I drove muddy roads down the (avenue)
Maybe power is when they don't know what got em (few)
Drive, that's when I learned to Drive

[Spoken: Shad]
I had a dream that I climbed down
From the so called high ground
They were still firing live rounds
But everything was quiet
And I awoke on the chapel floor
Wiped my tears and grabbed my rifle by the chapel door
Walked back with a sting
That feeling is fleeting as I try to keep
The dream is sweet, but violence doesn't sleep so
Drive

Clever men and our violence
Clever men and our violence
