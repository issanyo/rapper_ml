Hello, ladies and gentleman
Welcome to the starlight lounge
I'll be your host this evening
We're gonna have a lovely time
I have some friends I brought in
They go by the name of Hey Ocean!

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

Now I don't live in Van and I don't live in the school base
I live in the van man, I live out my suitcase
Ask my roommates I live off drive thrus, fries too, shirts and a tube of toothpaste

I live in a new place every few days
How I'm living is never staying a minute too late
I just move the the drum son, snooze when the sun comes
Someone once asked me if I knew what I run from

What are you running away from
What are you running away from
What are you running away from
Why are you running away

Gonna make this escape
Leave no notice just take off to any old place
As long as it's far away from where you are today

Gonna make this escape
Gonna make this escape
Gonna make this escape

Yo, it isn't my intuition to sit when I'm facing the fire
My end is a distance, I'm wired
To set the teens of a nation on fire
I supposed I was wired this way
Way back to the wired man, I'm a nature's man, they put this fire in me
Stray thoughts in my brain often can't stay on the same track
Train hopping now or the next plane take off
Then hit the runway make my escape cross the sky
We all die but I hate coffins
Can't stay boxed in here while I'm alive
Cause this place is a great coffin
And I may now know that I may not survive

What are you running away from
What are you running away from
What are you running away from
What are you running away from
What are you running away from
What are you running away from
Why are you running away

Gonna make this escape
Leave no notice just take off to any old place

Gonna make this escape
Gonna make this escape
Gonna make this escape
