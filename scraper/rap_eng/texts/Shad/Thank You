[Hook]
Thank you, I thank you

[Verse 1: Shad]
Yeah, after all the turmoil and test
The heat broiling the sweet toil and then sweat
I might hang up this b-boy and then step
To a chalk board and take a seat poised at a desk
Still talking to youth, still talking it through
Then sat when I Black Christopher walk in a booth
Dropping some truth and I picked off with this route
I'm travelling many times I've gotten lost in pursuit
Didn't always get it right some decisions I've questioned
From behind the mic when I spit in the session
I'm talking life but not giving no lessons
Some show me light I just give a reflection
Of the best pieces of my hometown
Police in the whole crowd round the old streets we would hold down
No doubt that commitment's giving me hope now
Good ground so mad seeds can grow out
I look up to ya'll and when I look back
I'm looking forward to more pictures to look at
G the rooms we never thought we could pack
I knew I should try, I knew I could rap
But talking honest I never thought I'd be good at
Man it's a jungle out here for a hood rat
Pray for a good cat see how I put that
Ahh I'm gassed

Skip
(Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty)

[Verse 2: Shad]
Mhmm, truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common sense
And make that good music like Consequence
They say my rhyming is a constant mix
Of blacking out on tracks then bringing consciousness
Shouts to my circle my circumference
For all the IOU's no consonance
Yeah my whole crew they gave me confidence
My few confidants, out to all my friends
And now I'm proud of my van and my Vancouver apartment
A proud man is a man who went through hardships
Don't say you can't, you can do it regardless
To the fans that helped us get started
The fam I gotta

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shad]
Yeah
And send peace to the nation of Rwanda
Where my momma and my father stay and pray for all my concerts
Not for props for honesty and honour in my conduct
See I was always taught to act my age and not my genre
And I'm just a product of the way that I was brought up
With Bradley Bravada and the aw-shucks persona
My T Dotters have got it hot as a sauna
Watching this rock college and Crawford down at the Mod Club
And T's gotta send a shout out to 'Sauga
He wants to say thank you and tell Hazel to holla'
It's all love from the talks to the pot lucks
Grandview, Cotton, I'm awestruck
I gotta
