[Verse 1]

Yo, now I'm supposed to be cool under the collar
A student of the dollar, a proven scholar in the school of commerce
A dude who's smooth and stalwart but whom never loses calm
Or drool and slobber like a fool and fall for a doll like Julia Roberts
But still they get to me like Destiny's Child
Don't drive me wild intellectually they fresh to see
I guess I'm being a misogynist and I acknowledge this
The problem is I just don't see all girls as goddesses
Cause so often of them I think less, like princess
Why's this silly pseudo pimp pressed against your pink dress?
When he drinks Ex does his stink breath impress
Cause he has no genuine interest, he only thinks sex
Not your heart, soul, or IQ and why do I know this
Well miss I try boo , but I'm a guy too
And so I'm qualified to say
That what a lot of guys display are just some hollow lies devised to get play
But I won't apologize cause most of y'all ain't slow chicks
With no wits so when a pro approaches you should know this
Its easy decodin' the motives of these horny guys
You're roses but the thorns you expose keep me torn inside
And keep me writin' poems devoted to my corny side
So prob'ly still be home with my folks when I'm 45

[Verse 2]

So I'm not quick to give props to cute chicks though they're hot
Cause dude the awful truth is when it comes to love they don't gots a clue
Like how does Pretty Woman constitute a romance?
Some old man that's got some loot knockin' boots with a prostitute
So homey don't be led astray in any way
When women say they want a man they mean a wallet and a wedding day
Still them girls with extensions in their hair and pretentious inner wear
That leaves me all defenseless in their stares
But they don't care for my attention which is senseless
Cause I swear that there's no need to mention good intentioned men are scarce
I want a Clair Huxtable, I want a Clair Huxtable y'all
Cause if I had a Clair Huxtable I'd tell her shyly
I'm like the letter Q, nowhere without U beside me
Nah, I won't make this any cheesier
Maybe I don't hate cause they're sleazier
But simply cause that way it's easier
I'm scared to fail so
Even if the chick has got a halo and a fat tail
Like J-lo I'll still lay low
This frail soul has only got his pride to protect him
So I'll deny a connection instead of vie for affection
Plus we find it soothing to mock the short skirts
Cause that length tends to mirror our sense of self worth sometimes
Instead of being free from these confines
Its safer to stay disgruntled and
Just pummel dumb minds with punchlines
Without discretion or respect to give 'em
Cause a good offense is the best defense mechanism

[Verse 3]

So I don't feel like tellin' y'all to throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em all around cause I just don't care
I'm a sharp jerk who leaves his heart's hurt
Buried deep beneath the smart smirk and in parts of my darker artwork
My partner's out there but we ain't together still
So I better build with someone cause I doubt that we ever will
And if I never feel love at least I'll never cry
If only fools fall guess I'm a pretty clever guy
For never trying and just voluntarily staying solitaire
Cause in all sincerity who wants to marry me?
I'm callous and cold and I've grown distant
Cause most sistren only talk to me when their man won't listen
The worlds a stage but not everyone acts right
At the club I'm seein' more tricks than a half-pipe
Now I'd never diss a sister or call one a slut or whore
But some honies is hard-headed like Mount Rushmore
I'm sorry I swore I won't bash
But if they treat you like a substitute teacher
Its probably cause you've got no class
Now hold fast every woman's a queen
If you're as lost as I am then you know what I mean
I'm out of love, I'm out of love
This is out of love
