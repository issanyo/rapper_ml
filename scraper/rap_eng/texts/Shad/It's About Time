[Verse 1: Shad]
Lost faith for a minute
He went on break for a minute
And let his strength escape for a minute
And he fell, this world ain't safe for a minute
Devil's favorite phrase, "this will only take a minute"
Don't sleep, can't not be awake for a minute
Cousin of death, and death don't take but a minute
Cynic, wishing every minute
Just talk and ticked off, just watching, tick-tock
Every minute times money, money talks, false prophets
Limited to no dividends, just loss every minute
Counting costs and props, and the job doesn't finish
Been going since time, been a hot minute
It's his thoughts all creeping around himself like a clock
Short hands trying to reach for the top every minute
True measure of a man, true measure of a minute
Is that both don't stop, time and soul infinite
Let it drop

[Hook: Shad]
It's about time
It's about the feeling when everything aligns
When you see the signs
When you crawl and you climb and you grind
And you finally arrive
It's about time

[Verse 2: Promise]
I lost faith for a minute
Went away to take a break for a minute
It seems hip-hop ain't safe while they in it
Just trying to make hits playing baseball with it
Wasn't first, what's worse is I'm late for the second
I've been in it for a minute, can't wait for a second
DJ's say there ain't no break in my record
Only if I act fake on my record
So it's time I take a second and think
First lines time my seconds in ink
Written by a good boy, produced by a Rich Kidd
It's time to prove what the definition of rich is
It is something that pass me my hands and mind
On another level, another class of rhymes
Song melodies, car remedies, longevity
It will last the time

[Hook x2: Promise]

[Verse 3: Shad]
It's a feeling when everything aligns
And when it does I find life speaks to me in rhyme
Like a rapper, life's Too $hort for stressing
Don't count down the seconds, count up the blessings
And don't count on getting many answers to the questions
The question mark's the spot we began to get the lessons
It's when you feel destined, when you feel the essence
The presence when you feel present in the present
It's about time, the hard times some do
And the minds in prison on the outside too
When the blinds so you can't see outside you
To the outside time, no outside you
I be running in my outside lane no high stepping
Full stride keep pace to the last second
So when I finish if they still want to ask questions
I'll be like Usain Bolt, check my track record

[Hook x2: Shad & Promise]
