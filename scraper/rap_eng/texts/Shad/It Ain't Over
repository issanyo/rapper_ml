[Hook]
So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
Baby it ain't over 'til it's over
So many years we've tried
To keep our love alive
But baby it ain't over 'till it's over

[Verse 1: Shad]
N-n-n nostalgia, thinkin bout my old home town
Growin up with folks showin us lovin that knows no bounds
But still I'm (Hey Ya!) single, dolo style
Mom and dad keep stickin two together, cuz we don't know how
Nowadays is seems love is fast, the come and go doesn't last
Little bundles of joy, cost big bundles of cash
And it's hard to buy in the city, I'm always flyin I'm busy
Do I need somethin real? I kinda get by with MIDI
And by to by all the cities seem the same till they're home
And likewise maybe ladies all seem the same till their known
And you grow together and then grow attached
Growing up is knowing that, we all need each other
And love requires no holding back
And no goin backwards, when your back hurts
I know it's strange
Hearing about commitment
From a bachelor that's over age
There's plenty of fish to capture and throw away
But Lenny just wished he was back Bonet

[Verse 2: Shad]
I get so hard on myself
For all the mistakes that I made
See I've been given so much
Don't let me throw it away - Hail Mary
Kelly wants to go for the win
Can't go the way of the buffalo bills - no get a ring
And take a knee, Don BeeBee , Andre Reed
Thurman Thomas players
I don't mean the coach, Mark Levy
All my non girl friend friends
Monica to pheobe
Still hoping love hasn't gone the way of the CD
Yeah it's cheesy, I know, I guess im talking to I
I still hear Isaac Hayes strings, when she's Walking On By
I been heart broken before, man im not gonna lie
For a bit, I quit hopin, said im not gonna try
I said its not gonna fly
They told me to spit something new
I said you can't force some things
I will when I do
I said I'm not gonna cry
They told me to find someone new
I said you can't force some things
I will when I do

I do I do I do
