[Verse 1: Lights]
Well, I guess I lost this round
The mountains have come down
I won't go where they go
No, I'll be back around
With our heads above the trees
And the storm at our knees
Come all the tides and tows
We'll stand above the sea

[Pre-Chorus 1: Lights]
Highs and lows
There are pits and lands
On the ground that you stand

[Chorus: Lights]
So flux and flow
Flux and flow

[Verse 2: Lights]
When we taste a bitter end
And hunger life again
We take another turn
With a better hand

[Pre-Chorus 2: Lights]
Highs and lows
There are pits and lands
On the ground that you stand
Flux and flow
And you fix your plans
Then you trade in your hand

[Chorus: Lights]
So flux and flow
Flux and flow
Flux and flow
Flux and flow

[Verse 3: Shad]
In the rat race, Ready, set, go
My heavy step slow, but I'm first at the finish line
Simply cause I never left home
I'm a rock man - Megadeth
That's key - treble clef lead
Better yet just be, let 'em see how you get your fresh
How you get free, how you shake 'em
Epilepsy with that Etch-A Sketch scenes, then remake em
Show em how you bend without breaking

[Chorus: Lights]
Flux and flow
Flux and flow
Flux and flow
Flux and flow

[Outro: Lights]
There are pits and lands
On the ground that you stand
And you fix your plans
Then you trade in your hand
