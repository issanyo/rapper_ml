[Hook]
Hang, you've got to hang on
Baby, baby, on

[Verse 1]
So you know, dudes complain about distribution
The game and the radio stations looping the same stupidness
But maybe they ain't playin' too much music on MuchMusic
Cause there ain't much music out here with much to it
When the music plays, we ain't saying too much through it
We just add to the ads, we just do it
Then get mad when they don't add us
Now they love Louis C.K
And David Chapelle cause the truth is
Comedians speaking more truth than we in music
Like we traded mediums, now we the ones that act foolish
Plus we need to laugh cause peep the stats, see the facts
That murder in Ferguson ain't even half
So it's either laugh or we crying
And if it's that, then we dying
So we quiet now, ain't a lot of rappers really trying
We goin' out without as much as a sound
Rest in peace MuchMusic
Rest in peace Mike Brown
This is right now
My man said he can't pipe down
They're putting pipelines right through the grounds in his town
I'm waking up too with too much music to write down
That's what we fight now
We fight pride, we fight doubt, lights out
I tell 'em listen, this system takin' my hope away?
That's like me not comin' up with something dope to say
It only motivates, I'm so awake
I'm dreaming of teaming up more mentors and protégés
To go and play on this field shoulder-to-shoulder blade
Steel-like composure, flow's real like a roll of tape
How the young boy make it feel like the golden age
But still so forward, this warrior's like Golden State
Over-standing like Golden Gate
These gold bars worth more than some gold record or golden chain
Take that momentum, don't let it go to waste
Feel that faith growin' everyday
Stay strong, hang on

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Feel me, yeah
One time for my heroes on the frontlines
Saving young lives on the daily, still driving Hyundais
Up at sunrise, see the sun shine
And when you come undone try to just hang on a hot minute
Hang on, I'm not finished, stop, listen
The Old Prince story, the plot thickens
Hang on, I saw a vision then lost it and caught a glimpse again
Saw it off in your distance, I'm walkin' out on a mission
The picture's always slippin'
This talking is how I hang on
Hands on, keep grippin' to it and stand strong
But that resistance, that commitment in a dance song
For all the children that the banks didn't bank on
For all the sistren that sick of no understanding
Played slow pitch but won't hit if they underhanded
Once abandoned but know what a loving man is
And that trust ain't too much to demand from a companion
Hang on, I'm Russell Brand entwined with Hustle Man
I'm from London, from the motherland, from another planet
From the underground rubble, I've risen up from Atlantis
Now I'm spitting for the humble in the struggle
Hang on, I'm gone

[Hook]
