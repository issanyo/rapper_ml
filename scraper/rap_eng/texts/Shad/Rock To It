Rock to it, a freak freak to it, to the beat to it this is how we do it
Rock to it, a freak freak to it, to the beat to it's unique music
Rock to it, a freak freak to it, to the beat to it this is how we do it

[Verse 1]
Shad concocts plots and perfects clever scams
You can't find a Better Man in an Eddie Vedder jam
MC's can't see the flow, unbelievable
We set records even when the needles broke
Don't need the dough, asking more bang for your buck
The only landed Canuck that can't handle a puck
Played penalty killers skillfully pass and poke-check
When black flows jet there's more cash than OPEC
Or Exxon ex-cons exploit the oil fields
Of the inner city some day I hope the soils heal
I toil building a dream where my future can stay safe
A place where I never have to move it or vacate
Physically, I'm not in great shape cause I placate
And don't consume greens besides whatever grass my steak ate
The fakes keep fronting but I just don't care
Wearin' Forces is the only time I put on airs
I spit a hard-hittin' verse, when I'm spittin' it hurts
I never shift into first, yet alone put the whip in reverse
My free-styling's like a gift and a curse
So sick with the verse, they gotta think Iâ€™ve written it first
And plus my skills and sounds thrills the crowd
I can fill my mouth with Prozac pills and I'd still get down

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Now whether on stage or in the studio space
We schoolin' in cats to the game it's just the usual case
I'm like you wanna learn to flow homie move to the bass
And if you wanna make dough homie move to the States
I see suckers in style and musical taste
Plus, when we step on the stage and flash that beautiful face
It makes the honeys' hearts beat above a suitable pace
Showing the super stylistics very few could replace
I'm that ill rap scholar never sweat the finances
Just takin' out a bank loan as big as my campus
These MC's need to stop taking their chances
Why scrap when you know my arms stronger than Lance's
Touring France with these mad rappers locked in their stances
They thought they had a move until I blocked their advances
I'll be low-key chillin, rhymes filling the whole sheet
Feeling down loading on sizzlon so seek
Students slash rapper so I'm dealing with no sleep
I'm still a cold thief when I'm stealing the show peeps
Get out this young brother with daps
My tongue smothers the whack
The dub never uncovered the traps
So I'm tryin' to give light through these mic devices
Not that I'm perfect only Christ was viceless
But there's too many dealing with the lightning crisis
All I want's a warm home and a wife thats righteous
We gonna get there y'all we gonna rock to it
We gonna rock to it, we gonna rock to it

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Now like the Biz Mark I write rap tunes in the bathroom
My influence is a Black Moon and Pat Boone
I roll with a whole platoon of phat goons
Who keep the hair on their backs groomed with a Vidal Sassoon
Pick up the phone just to get the tone
My bicep claim I gotta leg ups, so when I walk the talk I high-step
As a fetus I kick rhymes upon their scans
Even back in '82 my ultra-sound was the jam
I just rock to it never get forced into nothin'
But words like a mullet-cutting short on the front end
Y'all life's more than cake, no offense to the ballers
But we all pay too much attention to dollars
Brainwashed now I'm still learning how to be me
Worth millions, I'd rather be free, uniquely
No, I may never know myself completely
If I make it home maybe then I'll peep me
Just a capital B-Boy like meat street and DC
Rock to it while I take it easy
