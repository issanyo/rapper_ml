[Intro]
Stone Throwers
Forced to go toe-to-toe, blow for blow
In a war zone with only stones to throw
Vilified by all sides
Vilified for small crimes
Forced to go blow for blow
In a war zone with only stones to throw

[Chorus]
(Goliath)
We're gone in a blink (Gone in a blink)
We're gone in a blink (Yeah)
We're gone in a blink (Gone in a blink)
We're gone in a blink

[Verse 1]
Game hasn’t changed, same ol' monopoly
Same couple players own all of the property
I ain’t a prop, don’t give no props to me
My people still don’t eat properly
Think we forgot? We was just property
Think we’ll be bought again?
Think that they brought them democracy?
I think they brought back them poppy seeds
My people locked up for chopping
That’s hypocrisy
We wasn’t thought of
We wasn’t brought up and taught we was set up
That’s why we get caught up
Y’all discarded us
Put them bars up
Of course we got guards up
We hard cuz we’re hard up
They got them start-ups and Starbucks’
We got a couple of stars till they turn 'em to stardust
They starve us
Can’t even drink water
Up North with that Flint water
All in the sink as they sink farther
Kids on the brink
Y’all went to Harvard and Stanford
Think harder for answers man, think
We’re far below standards
Don’t tell me anger won’t help us
You told me the cancer would shrink
We need a shrink
We just see boys making bands: N’Sync
Open your eyes my fam, we all could be gone in a blink

[Chorus]
We're gone in a blink (Gone in a blink)
We're gone in a blink (Yeah)
We're gone in a blink (Gone in a blink)
We're gone in a blink

[Verse 2]
Listen, game hasn’t changed, same game of life we play
Maybe I’m only one roll of the dice away
From a Rolls with some ice and some gold on the license plate
We roll our whole life away
I think they gamed us
Made us be gamers
They gamed with the system
They made it to play us
Gave us controllers
But gave no control up
The game wasn’t made so we’d make it
It’s made up
It’s war that they’re waging
Just look at these wages they pay us
It’s pennies, it pains us
They paint us in corners
On corners
What can we do man, we’re cornered
I’m lucky I’m stuck in this booth
Stuck here all cooped up
People get stuck up for loot
Stuck up and bougie ones
Stuck us in Juvie
They could have stuck up for the youth
Stuck up for justice and truth
Now we can either get loud or they shut up and shoot
Give us a shot
Don’t shut us out from the group
You can shut down the nuke
Don’t push our buttons
It suddenly all could go poof
Gone in a blink
Gone in a blink
Gone in a blink
Gone in a blink

[Outro]
Forced to go toe-to-toe, blow for blow
In a war zone with only stones to throw
Vilified by all sides
Vilified for small crimes
Forced to go blow for blow
In a war zone with only stones to throw
Goliath
