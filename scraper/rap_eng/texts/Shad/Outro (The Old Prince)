[Kamau]
We spend our lives searching like scavengers, finding a way
Understanding that light is a sign of the day
So we squint in the darkness in search of a glow
And falter in trying, in trials we grow
Our hearts, they seem broken, our legs, they are weak
Our tongues are exhausted from trying to speak
Cause sometimes they listen, but often they don't
We easily help, but more often we won't
Because we've constructed the things that we want
Ghost our desires, desire to haunt
But our needs as below so above
What we all want, should look a little more, like love
