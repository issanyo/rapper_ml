They see people run, so they run
They see people duck, so they duck
But these bullets aren't real
Wanna feel?

Get it, got it, good
Get it, got it, good
They can't kill us, 'cause they can't see us, 'cause they only see fear
Get it, got it, good
They can't kill us, 'cause they can't see us, 'cause they only see fear
Get it, got it, good
Get it, got it, good

Damn it feels good to be back
Damn it feels good to be black
They keep on killing us
We just keep killing it
Mama said killin' is not where the healin' is
Couldn't speak back
Lord knows she been through it
She said a human is not who the villain is
She said it's fear, it's greed, and it's pride
You see it inside
That's what this system is built on
And what it instills in us
Man I've been feeling this vibe
Honestly the haters can hate
Just let the creators create
And let the creator be judge
I mean too many mistakes to be grudging
Beside, all of us lost without love
'Cause maybe some never get woke
Or tire of staying awake
Or party all night and distraught at the state of the day
Lord what do you make of this way that I'm walking
This path that I'm on, you made a way for me
Hope that my map isn't wrong, nowadays my legs is weak
What if my staff isn't strong, what if it breaks?
Uh, who got me? uh, you got me uh
I know that you got me good

Get it, got it, good
Get it, got it, good
Get it, got it, good
Get it!

Get it, got it, good
Get it, got it, good
Get it, got it, good
Get it, got it, good

I'm talking 'bout wavy
I'm talking 'bout ways we can elevate
Stepping up stair and we escalate
Don't try to separate, we'll get together and celebrate
I can do everything, I just don't hesitate
I can do anything, allow me to demonstrate
I just can't wait, I just can't not be me
I just can't go back and copy me
I just can't not be free
I just can't possibly
Lesson on lessons
Legends on legends on legends
Little black boy with a poem that he showed to the reverend
Jesus saw Judas and ran up to hug the young brother
It dug at the other eleven
Like "why is this traitor in Heaven"
He said it's Hell on Earth anywhere love isn't present
Wherever he goes, we go together my brethren
Get it?

Get it, got it, good
Get it, got it, good
Get it, got it, good
Get it, got it, good

Get it, got it, good
Get it, got it, good
Get it, got it, good
Get it, got it, good

They can't kill us, 'cause they can't see us, 'cause they only see fear
(The truth is bulletproof)
They can't kill us, 'cause they can't see us, 'cause they only see fear
Wanna be free? just answer one question, but answer honestly
What are you afraid of?
