[Verse]
On the subject of subjects
I learned geography is destiny and history is fate
Art is taste and the science of escape
Learned some five percent of math, learned girls love drama class
And home economics taught me class is about cake
That’s why leaders of the state say "Wait
When the homeless don’t eat we got a lot on our plate"
While the kids in class wait with the weight of a world
That’s obsessed with the weight of a girl for a break
And that dating game's chess, still checking for a mate
But what they say is hard for a pimp is harder for a man of faith
Placed in an incubator full of hot babes
Heaven give me Grace like Will cause I'm not gay
Strong willed for so long did not date
Chill, said "I don’t want a link, give me my space"
Like Tom now I’m tryna add a friend
If she on the same page like my comments and Top 8
Fiancé material, I’m writing spiritual raps
To fight with this mask like Rey Mysterio
Hear both sides full stereo
World full of pain got us waiting on a miracle
Waiting on the world to change
When we should wait on the world like a waiter
Serve the world man this world is strange
Bizarro, lovers of tomorrow to break
Under the weight of the wonder and the sorrow
