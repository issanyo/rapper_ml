When opportunity knocked
I had to stand up and come forward
And run towards it
From jump I didn't want more than
Just to make it through that front door without fronting
Just one tour, maybe one more
Then suddenly
The next opportunity knocked and said ‘open up’
One show
If you're dope enough they’ll know what’s up
And someone in the front row will notice ya and go home
And download some stuff and then show it to the
Next opportunity
Soon you might have a platform
Fans to rap for, stamps in your passport
Some bank - some backboard
Amped up - patch cord – I’m plugged in
Eyes focused on that door
The opportunity to give something, see it clear
You need to be aware
To seize it, to see it's there
It might not reappear
No need to fear, just one thing you need to hear
That knock
Now let it drop…

I still hear that knock in my dreams (X3)
That's why there’s no stopping my dreams


Sundays I read the times on my iPhone
Then sit down and read the times with my eyes closed
I feel the winds chilling my bones
Change is in the air and it's blowing like cyclones
See  was raised in the era where Jay said
If you wanna feed the poor, you gotta make bread
We forgot how to break bread
And give thanks - Never give up giving, we'll stay fed
Now that that day's dead, it's all team biz
We need kings that serve and queens to lead this
Less tuition, more each one teaches
Chuuuch - less preachers, more Jesus
Trust, I hear justice at the door knocking
Saying the people need more options
And I don't mean more coke cans or more soap brands
‘Cause more often than not
The word "choice" just means more shopping
And less for the boys on the floor stocking
We got a lot less voice though there’s more talking
The door's open on that lie now, we see through it
Eyes closed – I read the times and I see music
It's time for regrouping
For less people trying to be somebody, more people trying to be human
Before I leave the room I’m trying to keep doing
Keep the door open so we can move in
Let's go…

I still hear that knock in my dreams (X3)
That's why there’s no stopping my dreams
