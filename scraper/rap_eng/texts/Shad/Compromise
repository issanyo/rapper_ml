[Verse 1]
Yo, when I'm writing, I repeatedly edit words and rework tracks
I'll admit, I'm like the Raptors, I got weak first drafts
So when I'm dropping a new flow
It's probably not all that solid at first post, you might call it Araujo
But ballers improve, yo
And in the same way, soon the tunes get better and I polish a Juno
Who knows? I might get acknowledged and kudos
It's cool though, long as I keep rocking a few shows
Not to model some new clothes, pocket that loot bro
I'm still trying to figure tax, stocks, and the loopholes
Like where's the refund, we filed for 'em, deducted from gross
Shouldn't that be taken off the net, like child porn?
My smile's worn off but I ain't that pissed though
I still got cash and I don't lack distro
And if I didn't I wouldn't change to go bag fistfuls
Of cold green, homie I'm no black Minstrel Show

[Hook]
Shad just don't compromise
In this life, yo we just can't compromise
And with our time we just can't compromise
And with these rhymes yo I just can't compromise
Now, we just can't compromise
In this life, yo we just can't compromise
Cause it's a fight and you just can't compromise
Just don't compromise

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling like the people's champ see, my fans greet
A brother with hugs, laughs and daps, they don't yell like banshees
Or stampede, women ain't gotta dress fancy
For the man, please, my listeners understand me
My fight to go about this right what this stand means
It's more than some grand schemes to hold up a Grammy
We fighting in a war that we can't see
My brothers and sisters in this struggle, there's no fans, we family
Same root and branch tree, listen I'm amped, keep
Your hearts warm, mine's on fire and I'm antsy
I know it's so cliche but I'm angry
That some can't eat, meanwhile I'm letting a damn feast
Of pastas and canned meats, rot in my pantry
Like, Lord please, can we speak on this frankly?
Like, God why you letting this happen? Amen
He answered, "Son, I'm asking you the same thing
Cause you're supposed to be my servants out there working
Like you're my hands reaching out to those that's hurting
You don't have long on this Earth and
I hope you won't compromise, I said I hope you won't compromise"

[Hook]

[Outro]
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
Stay true to the finish
