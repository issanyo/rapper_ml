[Peace Intro: Shad]
Clever men and our violence
Silence is when we shoot from the lip to quiet them
We talk nonviolence and stay silent when it suits
It's all violence at the root
But tyrants aren't tyrants in group
Who started the shooting?
Who knows?
We were born inside of this troupe
Taught to shoot as youth
Taught it's just humans being human
But the truth is- (Shoot, get it? Get it?)
The truth is-
We don't know what the truth is
(Get it, got it, good!)

[Peace Verse 1: Shad]
Yeah, yeah
One time for the people in my bloodline
A proud son of the people of the sunshine
My love letter to my people on the frontline
Yours truly, even if my pen was unsigned
Know it, the unnamed poet
My life is just a link in the chain and my chain glowin'
Me and the beat is thinkin' the same, she said "go in"
I just sprint in my lane, Usain, they can't slow him, oh

[Peace Chorus: Shad]
My whole team move at light speed
But we so smooth, the whole movement Tai Chi
I said my whole team move at light speed
But we so smooth, the whole movement Tai Chi
We strike back with their force
They fight, we get more strength like Air Force
No Nikes, I mean no Air Force
More like peace
Soul, body, and psyche, yo

[Peace Verse2: Shad]
Now put this beat on for my people trying to keep on lights
And Nissans with the lease on tight
Black folk like Deshaun and Keishawn, white
Folk get your dijon and your quiche on light, woo
Listen, this is like a "thank you" you can dance to
Jam hot as a sand dune in Cancun
Show you how the fam moves, how a champ do
I can't lose when I'm kicking it, Man U
See they like me 'cause I ain't the type to lick a shot, still
If the shooter make me shoot it I can't miss the shot
Pistol cocked, more like missile launch, chill
And it piss 'em off how they can't piss him off (till it cross)

[Peace Chorus: Shad]
My whole team move at light speed
But so smooth, the whole movement Tai Chi
I said my whole team move at light speed
But we so smooth, the whole movement Tai Chi
We strike back with their force
They fight, we get more strength like Air Force
No Nikes, I mean no Air Force
More like peace

[Spoken]
See, the fool said
They see people run, so they run
They see people duck, so they duck
But these bullets aren't real
Wanna feel?

[Peace Outro]
They can't kill us
'Cause they can't see us
'Cause they only see fear

They can't kill us
'Cause they can't see us
'Cause they only see fear

Wanna feel?

They can't kill us
'Cause they can't see us
'Cause they only see fear
And we're fearless

Wanna feel?

But they said

[War: Shad]
We know life in its sacredness
We know life 'cause we've taken it
You can't know life without death
We know war, we know best

We know life in its sacredness
We know life 'cause we've taken it
You can't know life without death
We know war, we know best

Some wounds don't heal you wanna feel?
You don't know the shame or the thrill
You don't know pain, you claim to be real
But you never killed and you never will
You can't know life without death
We know war, we know best
We know life in its sacredness
We know life 'cause we've taken it

Blood and guns and blood and cum
My Bloody gums, don't mind my tongue
If blood is what I'm bloody pluggin
I'm the vile arm of life

I just don't like sleep is all
It's too close to death
So I'll keep from fallin' asleep
I wanna keep it all
I keep a weapon on me
You can keep it calm
I've been weak and wrong
I've been keeping it cheating, deceitful, and evil
See I know life
These bullets aren't real, wanna feel?
I wanna be numb, gimme the numbers
I live in a slum, I want slumber
They only look at the thumb that keep us under
I know life, I know death
You never shot and stopped breath
See I know regrets, I know debts
You might be right but you know less
I know fights, I know stress
When you can't forget and clean a mess up
When it's not just done
It's true than an uzi weighs a ton in the heat of the sun
Look, some wounds don't heal, you wanna feel?
You don't know the shame or the thrill
You don't know pain, you claim to be real
But you never killed and you never will
You can't know life without death
We know war, we know best
We know life in its sacredness
We know life 'cause we've taken it
And you can't own what you've never known
So I'll take yours, get shown what it's like
This death, this life, this fight is real
Some wounds don't heal
Wanna feel?

Blessed are the peacemakers for...[unintelligible]
