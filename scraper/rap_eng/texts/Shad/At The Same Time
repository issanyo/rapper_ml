[Verse 1]
I never laughed and cried at the same time
Until, I heard a church pray for the death of Obama
And wondered if they knew they share that prayer with Osama
Blasphemy and karma, the comedy of drama
I never laughed and cried at the same time
Until, I imagined, they were suddenly aware of it
But wondered who's the heretic, and is the true terrorist, American or Arabic
A mix of surprise and embarrassment
Laughing and crying at the same time
Different lives, all the same dying
Two enemies of the same mind
Same hope, same laughter, same crying
But I never laughed and cried at the same time
Until, I saw a child wish on a star, and it came true
And realized the two of them, shared the same view
From below and above, with the light within
That glows like love and illuminates the truth
I never laughed and cried at the same time
Like Marvin singing "I Heard It Through the Grapevine"
Until, I saw an old prince, with the fear of a crown
And smoke filled his eyes, with the tears of a clown

[Hook]
I never laughed and cried at the same time
I never laughed and cried at the same time

[Verse 2]
See, my heart cries, out against lies
So I hate when it's sunny, when the world seems blue
It's only funny, cause it's true
But with humour and me it's less funny, more funny when it's you
That's the rules that we play by
So I never laughed and cried at the same time
Until, I saw a boy, with a teardrop tatted
Smiling face, painted with a faint trace of sadness
He was laughing and crying at the same time
They say you can't fall in love with the same mind
I hope it gets there, if I was ever even here
Memory's strange, the past, like the future's never clear
But I'm pretty sure I never smile, while I shed a tear
I never laughed and cried at the same time
Until, I saw my father, as a young man like me
I never laughed and cried at the same time
Until, I saw god, as a young man like me
I never laughed and cried at the same time
Until, I saw a girl, bring a smile to her brother
With the wisdom of a child, for the death of their mother

[Hook]
