[Said The Whale]
If I’m serious and I’m all about it
I could see it through, try to live without it
I seriously doubt it

If I’m fucking up everyone will notice
If I laugh it off like it hardly matters
Then I’ll definitely do it
But if it doesn’t entertain us
If it doesn’t entertain us

If I make it up, lie to you about it
You could see right through
Fortunately for me you will always be there when I hit the ground
(ground)
But if it doesn’t entertain us
If it doesn’t entertain us

But if it doesn’t entertain us
If it doesn’t entertain us
Yeah-Yeah-Yeah

[Shad]
Yeah Yeah
Hosty in the cut
Cocky little mutt
Mug full of coffee
Got me in the love mood
Hot tea in the mug (?)
Young Blood
Rob Lowe
Hockey and a puck
Took a good shot
When she caught me in a bluff
Took a good shot
When she caught me with her bud
Could have bought weed
But she knocked it to the rug
Stop with him
Off beat, off mean
