[Chorus: Shad]
It's just like that as we proceed
And we out yeah
Luxurious limoncello's what we 'bout yeah
Tahiti violin vibrations no doubt yeah
Celebrations and salutations and we out yeah, yeah, yeah
It's just like that as we proceed

[Verse 1: Shad]
Introducing, Cadillac I'm blowing tree finessing slalom slopes down the wavy West coast, making toasts
And a special dedication, up another level, levitation
It's yoga heavy metal meditation
We floating only upwards
Only tenderonies when homies open up the cupboards
Triple kiss fam subtle signal, Prosecco in the pail getting carried in
All white linen suits, still y'all pale in comparison
Y'all stale in comparison, embarrassing a suave C
I'm set off in St Lucia and then sailing to Paris
In the Bay Key, flaky, pastry, paisley
Rug on my back laying flat getting reiki
Que pasa? Steak lobster and talking Gaza Strip politics
Applause at the plaza playing all their hits
Speaking in Aruba with a mademoiselle
Med student moonlighting with Maybelline the moolah

[Chorus: Shad]
And we out yeah
Luxurious limoncello's what we 'bout yeah
Tahiti violin vibrations no doubt yeah
Celebrations and salutations and we out yeah, yeah, yeah
It's just like that as we proceed
And we out yeah
Luxurious limoncello's what we 'bout yeah
Tahiti violin vibrations no doubt yeah
Celebrations and salutations and we out yeah, yeah, yeah
It's just like that as we proceed

[Verse 2: Shad]
You see me dipping in that semi Davis flav'
Sam and Dave is playing
Salmon-glazed sunset sky from the ground
Stone town home silk silhouette on the strip
Shoot a smirk from the shadow, ma√Ætre d', take a seat
As we travel towards a make-believe, make belief
Lake Louise chalet, hate to ski, valet
Take the key, shoot cinematic as we sipping Limoncello
Felica Green and she be sipping Limoncello
Juan LeBron got the gritty shack shaken out
Five figure thread count on her baby crib
The music business class can take
And crystal glass pearls and a blaze of tennis racket and a pistol stashed overnight, flight back to Addis
Shad it's me it's us and we stay elegant as whom

[Chorus: Shad]
And we out yeah
Luxurious limoncello's what we 'bout yeah
Tahiti violin vibrations no doubt yeah
Celebrations and salutations and we out yeah, yeah, yeah
It's just like that as we proceed
And we out yeah
Luxurious limoncello's what we 'bout yeah
Tahiti violin vibrations no doubt yeah
Celebrations and salutations and we out yeah, yeah, yeah
It's just like that as we proceed
