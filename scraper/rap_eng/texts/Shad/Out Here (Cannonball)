[Verse 1]
Real wild, just can't chill out
Since a little child basically 'til now
I been a spaz since Simpson and Milhouse been pals
Since Al and Clinton
Bills now paid, grown and I feel proud
I don't cry over milk getting spilled out
I don't play though, when I play shows
I play those like it's Play-Doh
And I'm paid though
Slave flows like Dope Boy when they hit
Ricky still can't delegate
Look how I get busy, I'm just a menace
Every single sentence I'm sentencin'
Corrupt judges to the peniten-
White Eminem, black Bob Dylan
What more can I say, top billin
Lately I'm feeling like a Star Wars star
Part villain but bigger part hero in the end, God willin'

[Hook]
As we go a little somethin' like this
As we go a little somethin' like this
We come to the party in a b-boy stance
Step on the stage and make the girls wanna dance
We come to the party in a b-boy stance
Step on the stage and make the girls wanna dance

[Verse 2]
These days I walk the streets in a heatwave
Feet achin', my skin tanner than DJ
Brain full of bitties, bag full of beat tapes
Heart full of hope, belly full of cheese steak
Cheapskate, I would buy BK on Ebay
Anything for a free shake and a rebate
Release date? please wait
Promise when I give it, though
It won't be late or delayed, back to spittin' flows
Buggin' out, givin' 'em another sound
When it's found underground, some say above the clouds
Well I can't lie, the man flier than these stand-byers
They just want that plane, I'll take the hang-glider
I don't sell, I never been a Sanjaya idol
Of a boy band made up of vampires
I just spit lava
These kid's hand driers campfires
Someone turn the amp higher, tell 'em!

[Hook]
As we go a little somethin' like this
As we go a little somethin' like this
We come to the party in a b-boy stance
Step on the stage and make the girls wanna dance
We come to the party in a b-boy stance
Step on the stage and make the girls wanna dance
