It's all in your frame of mind
Let It go, you already know
The world is yours, night and day
I want to see you shine

It's all in your frame of mind
Let it go, you already know
The world is yours, night and day
I want to see you shine

Y'all are light work
This my life's work
I don't write verses
I'm talkin' right versus wrong
There's a fight goin' on
Tryin' to find the right purpose
Tryin' to find the right person
Who is at the end of my search?
It's me
I had to earn his trust
I had to learn to trust myself
First, puttin' someone else's concerns above myself
When it hurts
Can you shake it off
When you take a loss
When they make you lose it?
When they say you're soft
Can you play through it
Play music?
Take abuses
Stay in tune
In the game
All the same
Stay improvin'
Keep it human
Keep in tune
While you keep it movin' for the movement

Don't be paralyzed
Don't be be scared to try
Don't carry it all
You can share the weight
Let it marinate
I'm here when you call

It's all in your frame of mind
Let It go, you already know
The world is yours, night and day
I want to see you shine

It's all in your frame of mind
Let It go, you already know
The world is yours, night and day
I want to see you shine

I been feelin' like I'm ready to red stripe and zone
Feelin' like some red lights in the dead of night alone
Too many red eyes and Red Bulls, unread texts and Redtube
No rest in my bed at night at home
Maybe I won't ever get it right
Never set it right
If I write it down
At least I said it right
When I get the mic
Can I give it up
Just to give em' love
Not to get a like
It's cause and effect
It causes the message we get
That we're faulty, defective, a God-awful mess
The effect is depression
So we ball out, put walls up to protect from rejection
Pause and reflect
Acceptance, acknowledge this breath
What we've got is a blessing when it's all in perspective

Let it out
When in doubt
Though we all
Feel in doubt
In the clouds
In the rain
Sing it out

It's all in your frame of mind
Let It go, you already know
The world is yours, night and day
I want to see you shine

It's all in your frame of mind
Let it go, you already know
The world is yours, night and day
I want to see you shine

Can you bear it, bear witness to pain
Theirs and yours, In silence?
