Spittin' images, a couple double Ds
Two couples double-dating and a bacon doublecheese
Stuff I must've seen many times on a billboard
How to make a rich man buy? Make him feel poor
How to make a stick many cry? Make him real or
Just draw on eyes, let him see what he was built for
Someone was bored and made us to fill space
On a big black board until the day we're erased
Little black boy with a smile on his face
Some chalk on his hands and some thoughts on faith
Maybe heaven is the height of the stakes at the gates
Where they ask what you loved and how much time did you waste?
Hate's the hell at the bottom of a waterless well
We scale down but get less in the pail
Guess it's something like an addict's life or like a battered wife
What we cling to can kill us but still it's hard to sacrifice
There, I'm over being over stuff, I care
I told this old soul to never settle for despair
I told this young heart that a rebel isn't rare
There's a few that keep the devil in their prayers
