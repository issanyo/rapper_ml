[Verse 1]
Never worry 'bout a single hatin motherfucker
Lookin like my next supper, all these moves that I'm makin got people talkin
Like how many papers is this man signin, I'm back wit the backpack rap
Man I'm thinkin that this shit finna make them scat, got a bag full of cash if we talkin bout that
Run run it like Forrest Gump can you feel that, ay
I'm a renaissance man, if you wanna get a feat you not gon get response man
I be hotter than some shit your mom cook in a sauce pan
Don't be jealous don't be rude go back to rollin up grams
People think I'm sick as shit but I'm just eatin on ham
Wanna beat me in my game then bitch I'm settin up camp
When the females hear my name I know they pussy all damp
Mr. Veterinarian I make that kitty go ham (damn)

[Hook]
Ballin only seventeen my skin is green
Watching numbers goin up that's just the everyday routine
All my old friends hit me up they wish they had a time machine
Feelin like I'm Cube I always hit 'em with no vaseline

[Post-Hook]
Always sayin no when you ask em if they got beef with me
DMs blowin up I always say no bitch this dick ain't free
Watchin on your every move I got that shit on DVD
Flexin all the time but I just know that you a bourgeoisie

[Verse 2]
You got cash, buy sum chains, I buy houses ain't that strange
You ain't shit, I get lit, all you do is counterfeit
Little chick, but she thick, and she always on my drink
Shit I'm thirsty give it back, and she blondy just like Zac
("who the fuck is Zac?" "high school musical")
Bitch hold my stacks I'm 30 minutes late to France
Gotta get this cash, never give no chance, better bounce that ass, paid her an advance
Got me thru this day, sippin on Bombay, I dont trust you gotta take this survey
Man I don't look back, never cut no slack, better get way back, fore yo ass get smacked uhh
Memphis flow but I'm from Jakarta ho, never understood my hustle but I guess the more you know
Checkin on your Instagram I see that shit is going slow, always hating on the progress man yo ass has gotta go

[Hook]
Ballin only seventeen my skin is green
Watching numbers goin up thats just the everyday routine
All my old my friends hit me up they wish they had a time machine
Feelin like I'm Cube I always hit em with no vaseline

[Post-Hook]
Always sayin no when you ask em if they got beef with me
DMs blowin up I always say no bitch this dick ain't free
Watchin on your every move I got that shit on DVD
Flexin all the time but I just know that you a bourgeoisie
