[Chorus]
Word on the street, they said that you close to me
Don't like the energy, are we friends or enemies?
Stay away from my face, man, you give me allergy
You just hate while I phase on another frequency
On so many lists, but still pull up in a Lyft
Lately I'm on my ways, listen what my gut will say
In Airbnb's, got one hundred-thousand keys
But you know where I stay, don't let me catch a case

[Verse 1]
On my way to the bank, got more checks
Last night she fucked me way too hard
I'm 'bout to crack my vertebrae, I do more than what I say
You just talk but when time comes you really can't locate
I been back on my bullshit, tell your bitch to suck my dick
You remind me of what I don't wanna be
Be the worst, be the name in case you start an agency
My dad is a lawyer, he would tell me 'bout his days at work
That one time he thought his partner tried to get him fuckin' murked
Last time that I saw you, I gave you a lesson to be learned
Sit down do your homework, I'ma count my blessings like a clerk

[Chorus]
Word on the street, they said that you close to me
Don't like the energy, are we friends or enemies?
Stay away from my face, man, you give me allergy
You just hate while I phase on another frequency
On so many lists, but still pull up in a Lyft
Lately I'm on my ways, listen what my gut will say
In Airbnb's, got one hundred-thousand keys
But you know where I stay, don't let me catch a case

[Verse 2]
Reppin' red and white so hard I barely can control it
I don't care 'bout relevance, I write my bars then I go drop it
Poppin' mollies not important, on the uppers, I'm in heaven
Ready for the revelation and the best for all my bretherens, aye
Eatin' on that Frito-Lay, give a fuck what they gon' say
Girl from Hawaii told me that her name was Lilo, ayy
And that pussy bald, look like it just got a chemo, ayy
Damn, that wasn't cool, honey mustard's got a better taste
I do know what you want, I'm gon' never give it up
I can make you disappear for just a couple hundred bucks
Tryna play me, good luck, young and sharp just like a cut
Get your extras like the first time in the club

[Chorus]
Word on the street, they said that you close to me
Don't like the energy, are we friends or enemies?
Stay away from my face, man, you give me allergy
You just hate while I phase on another frequency
On so many lists, but still pull up in a Lyft
Lately I'm on my ways, listen what my gut will say
In Airbnb's, got one hundred-thousand keys
But you know where I stay, don't let me catch a case
