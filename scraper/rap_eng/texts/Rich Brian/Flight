[Verse 1]
Ayy, ayy, now I see that everybody start to fuck with me
'Cause they feelin' like I'm finna go down as a OG
Flame lowkey on the top of their dictionaries talkin' down on me
And I always say, "Guess we'll see"
Guarantee that you're always finna think I'm on speed
Sound a little trippy, think I'm on LSD, 14 when I started doing it
Home school kid never knew he was a prodigy, aye
Get back on the track, with the crack stack
Pilin' in my wallet, gettin' fat like a shake shack
Pictures on my Snapchat, that's all I got about last night
All I know is she was goddamn tight (aye)
Went to America, shit is feelin' biblical
All my life I only saw it on the digital
Said, "I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po"
On the visa so I can't be smokin' indica

[Chorus]
Flyin' 20 hours never felt so right
They say I get better as the days go by
I'm just tryna be the goat, used to see them walk by
Gettin' ready for this life,  all I see is red and white
Flyin' 20 hours never felt so right
They say I get better as the days go by
I'm just tryna be the goat, used to see them walk by
Gettin' ready for this life, all I see is red and white

[Verse 2]
Landed in Chicago, met the customs
Mean muggin' mothafuckers let me tell ya something
And I almost got deported back to the home town
'Cause I didn't know what road my hotel's on
Then I met my manager, Sean 88 chillin' in the passenger
And I'm feelin' tripped out, seein' him for the first time
Worked overseas for a year, that's a long run (88)
Now I'm finally here
What now? What to do next? I don't care
Every single day feel like I'm on a mission
Workin' with Pharrell on my first damn session
Never had to write in a room with nobody
Feelin' under pressure, man this dude made "Happy"
Wrote a couple bars while chuggin' on a Red Bull
Then all of a sudden, all my worries turn into vapors ayy

[Chorus]
Flyin' 20 hours never felt so right
They say I get better as the days go by
I'm just tryna be the goat, used to see them walk by
Gettin' ready for this life, all I see is red and white
Flyin' 20 hours never felt so right
They say I get better as the days go by
I'm just tryna be the goat, used to see them walk by
Gettin' ready for this life, all I see is red and white
