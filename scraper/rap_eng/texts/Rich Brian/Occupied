[Chorus]
I done wore a lot of hats
Tell my team "take all my people to the back"
I don't need to flex or tell the people where I'm at
Who I'm with or who I'm seein' later, where I went
All their validation ain't gon' matter in a sec

[Verse]
Throw back to the fake Rolex
Put it on and went into the club like "Where the hoes at?"
'Member sittin' down on my computer bumpin' Kodak
Thinkin' I should probably go delete all of my old tracks
Silly me for thinkin' I should probably done more of that
I like all my women short and sweet like all my old raps, uh
Gotta wait 'til I'm done (ayy)
Don't need no more trash, I got too many where I'm from (ayy)
I done put in work and now I'm havin' all the fun
I just did a tour, I'm ready for another one
I can turn your girl to mine in just a second
Don't get fooled by how I smile 'cause I can get to actin' reckless
I been livin' so good, it's been a while that I've been jealous
Killin' shit is what I say when they ask 'bout my occupation
Got my U.S. Visa on the day before I flew in (ayy)
I don't got too many friends, I just hang with the 88s
Red and white, born and raised, took a flight, to LA
Hang with my, day to day, kiss a chick in the face
Then I put it on her face, we still goin' through this phase
We been fightin' everyday, shit is sad like anime
Never wanted it to be a mess, but you gotta get up out my way
Driving lesson, shoulda told you stay up in your lane
When I'm doin' business, better stay the fuck away
Made me blow up like a microwave
I be makin' sure that I be fuckin' up your day
I don't mind the fans
Showin' love to everybody be the most important thing
I got Andrew with me, and he down to take a stab
Wait for me to walk it, is the word he always say
All these protocols, I'm slowly turnin' to a diva man
I'ma beat the runners ass if he don't got my Chic-Fil-A, aye
Never like to brag, but I do it in my raps
What I'm tryna tell you is

[Chorus]
I done wore a lot of hats
Tell my team "take all my people to the back"
I don't need to flex or tell the people where I'm at
Who I'm with or who I'm seein' later, where I went
All their validation ain't gon matter in a sec
