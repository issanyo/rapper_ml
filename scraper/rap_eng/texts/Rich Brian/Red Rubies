[Intro: Yung Bans]
Aye, aye, aye
Red rubies and they bleed
Yeah, pop some percs, I might O.D
Aye, yuh, aye

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
(Yeah, aye) red rubies and they bleed
(Yeah, aye, huh) Perkys make me sleep
(Aye, yeah) Pop ten percs, I might O.D
(Aye, aye, yeah) Tryna fight away the demons

[Verse 1: Yung Bans]
I’m tryna fight em' away
I mix the Sprite with the lean
Young nigga ride with it, uh
Young nigga ride with the thing
Young nigga ride with the cling
Young nigga ride with that .30
Choppa it doin’ so dirty
Freaky lil bitch, she a squirter
Fuck the lil hoe and I work her
They give me head like a turtle
Dive in the pussy, it's surfing
All of the addies and perkys
I sip the lean with no mercy
I am so high, I'm on Mercury
Slim in the cut and he lurkin’

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
(Yeah, aye) red rubies and they bleed
(Yeah, aye, huh) Perkys make me sleep
(Aye, yeah) Pop ten percs, I might O.D
(Aye, aye, yeah) Tryna fight away the demons

[Verse 2: Rich Brian & Don Krez]
Rubies dancin’ they help me take yo bitch
But you still hit me up but I'd rather choose to ignore you
What’s the need for college at this point
We gon be on this fuckin' all night
To stay up she can’t afford a coffee
Pussy ring, I could see the future change
I’m alone, she can see I’m not the same
She want me to wait for her, then I said “No Thanks!”
We really in the jungle ‘cause I’m only seein' snakes
Don’t know who to trust, I need a break
I can feel my soul running away
Hope the rubies gon' brighten my day
Pray to God that I won’t ever fail

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
(Yeah, aye) red rubies and they bleed
(Yeah, aye, huh) Perkys make me sleep
(Aye, yeah) Pop ten percs, I might O.D
(Aye, aye, yeah) Tryna fight away the demons

[Verse 3: MaSiWei]
Red ruby jello on my strawberry (yeah, aye)
I eat her out, make me stomach ache (yeah, aye)
She wit' me and oh, and she on my dick (yeah, aye)
I’m feeling lust to suck my dick (aye)
Red like a block (block!)
Haters suck (suck!)
Pussy so rich, she want me to stay
She know what’s up (she know it)
She kinda cute (ooh, yeah)
She draped in Chanel (Chanel!)
I'm making her drip
You be hating but
You just be look like a joke (look like a joke)
Be who you wanna be
Working, never sleep (I never sleep, I never sleep)
She don’t even speak Chinese (yeah, aye)
But she can't stop looking at me

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
(Yeah, aye) red rubies and they bleed
(Yeah, aye, huh) Perkys make me sleep
(Aye, yeah) Pop ten percs, I might O.D
(Aye, aye, yeah) Tryna fight away the demons

[Verse 4: Yung Pinch]
Is this real or am I dreamin’?
I need to know now
You cut me deep, I can’t stop bleeding
I’ve been on the deep end, fighting all these demons
Don’t think you can help me
But that’s just what they tell me
Look, I’ve been on my own
Ever since a youngin
Supposed to be nobody’s son
Just living like “Fuck it” (fuck it)
Count up all these hundreds
Stack bands in my pocket (yeah)
Took off like a rocket (yeah)
No way that you can stop it
But they don’t want to see us win
They think that shit's obnoxious
(They think that shit's obnoxious)
But I ain’t got no option
(I ain't got no option)
But I ain’t got no option
(I ain't got no option)
We ain’t go no option

[Outro: Yung Pinch]
Yeah they bad, yeah
I just want to go to sleep, yeah yeah
Oh no not me, yeah yeah
