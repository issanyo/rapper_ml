[Chorus: NIKI]
I got a secret, I gotta keep it
No, I ain't 'bout to jinx it, though
I'ma knock on wood and climb uphill
Lookin' out windows, I'm wishin'
I'm seein' bills, mint condition
No, I ain't gonna tell a soul, I'll just make this real, I'll show ya

[Verse 1: Rich Brian]
Born in Jakarta, but I live like I'm from Calabasas
Roll seven deep, they make my life feel so much like a movie
I don't really know what I'm watchin' (what I'm watchin')
But I know it's Royce that I'm ridin' (that I'm ridin')
Go 'head and dream, take some melatonin, it 'gon help you sleep
Point it at the target, shoot your shot, while countin' 1, 2, 3
No, this ain't a game that we playin' (that we playin')
This is life and boy you better not go waste it (go waste it)

[Chorus: NIKI]
I got a secret, I gotta keep it
No, I ain't 'bout to jinx it, though
I'ma knock on wood and climb uphill
Lookin' out windows, I'm wishin'
I'm seein' bills, mint condition
No, I ain't gonna tell a soul, I'll just make this real, I'll show ya

[Verse 2: Rich Brian]
Uh, too lit for my own good, hopin' I'ma make it
My fans, they are doubtin' but that ain't no environment to live in
Ayy, they just walk around with no direction
Think we got a different destination, man
Too dumb to listen, goals already written
Fire in my soul can't hold no composure, I'm goin' off
It's my dream and ain't nobody finna wake me up
Don't wake me up

[Chorus: NIKI & Rich Brian]
I got a secret, I gotta keep it
No, I ain't 'bout to jinx it, though
I'ma knock on wood and climb uphill
Lookin' out windows, I'm wishin' (Look out windows, I'm wishin')
I'm seein' bills, mint condition (I'm seein' bills, mint condition, ayy)
No, I ain't gonna tell a soul, I'll just make this real
Ayy, ayy, I'll show ya
Let's do one more later
