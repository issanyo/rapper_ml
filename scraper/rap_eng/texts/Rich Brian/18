Part I

[Intro: Kris Wu]
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, oh it's a vibe
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, vibe

[Verse 1: Kris Wu]
When I jump into the temple (when I)
Prefer a local mental
Bending knees and wishing place inside to hide low, go
Took a beer I need a 这个beat让你倒地
能力超出你底线
帮助你觉醒
或是打听你的一字一句
都已经到期
都是我玩具
都对我赞许
所以才会把你领地占据
Yeah, like I'm running the game (game)
Don't you fuck with my fame
Light it up, spark it up, burn it into flames
I'm the one and only motherfucker from the East
All them bitches lining up to feel me, spit it then I peace
Gettin' in my zone (gettin')
I do this shit alone (I do)
I'm the Yeezus of the East
You need to Watch the Throne (yeah)

[Chorus: Kris Wu]
All this ice be on me but I still be risin'
I’ll be on your labels but I'm still ridin'
Say that I be falling but they see me flyin'
When you peep me, I’m at the top
Ayy, turn up, turn up
Oh now, the tides are turnin'
I ain’t never, ever doubt what I’ve been affordin'
All this ice be on me but I still be risin'
Say that I be fallin' but they see me flyin'

[Verse 2: Rich Brian]
Yeah, tell your chick I like her, take it on my Leica
And I'm always stacking paper, but my name ain't Michael
Got a crib in Indo, it's tall just like the Eiffel
I could get her number if I put it on my rider (yuh)
God damn legit, told me that she liked my fit
When I take her out to dinner, man, the check ain't gettin' split
Don't look like I'm getting thinner with the chickens and the ribs
Man, your bitch is what I say
One day, I saw her and got the kiss
Don’t say my name, I never wanna breathe your air
Coke and Kool-Aid, there’s just some shit you don’t compare
I got a x-ray and I just saw my old girl there
She was my ex babe, but now I really just don’t care
I'm so tired, but my mind is racin'
Fuck with me and see what kinda problems you'll be facin'
Friday 13th, I make you look like you met Jason
Like a damn femur poppin', just what I’ve been cravin'

[Chorus: Kris Wu]
All this ice be on me but I still be risin'
I’ll be on your levels but I'm still ridin'
Say that I be falling but they see me flyin'
When you peep me, I’m at the top
Ayy, turn up, turn up
Oh now, the tides are turnin'
I ain’t never, ever doubt what I’ve been affordin'
All this ice be on me but I still be risin'
Say that I be fallin' but they see me flyin'

Part II

[Chorus: Joji]
They said that I won't make it
They said that I won't change
They say that I'm not flexin' (Pow-pow-pow)
Now they say wow, you've changed (skrrt)
Now they say why you change
Now they say why you changin'
Yeah, they ask why you've changed
When the rest ain't looking like me

[Verse 3: Trippie Redd]
(Fourteen and Seventeen)
No way, no way, stay the same
Got that purple in my vein
It ain't hard to feel their pain
While I'm rocking Saint Laurent
Purple body like a Saint
Ooh, big body coupe just like a tank
I'm just swerving, smoking on some dank
I'm just tryna fucking ease the pain
‘Fore I blow my mind like Kurt Cobain
No I won't change
No I won't change
No I won't change
Yeah, and I promise I won't change
And I promise I'm the same
Trippie Redd, you know my name
Bitch, they say that I'm insane
I might blow your fucking brain
Bitch, I'm fly just like a crane
Feels like I'm fallin' off a plane
Feels like I'm fallin' off a plane
And that bitch got angel wings
And just spitting all these flames
And it just 'nnihilate the lames
And it annihilate the lames

[Chorus: Joji]
They said that I won't make it
They said that I won't change
They say that I'm not flexin' (Pow-pow-pow)
Now they say wow, you've changed (skrrt)
Now they say why you change
Now they say why you changin'
Yeah, they ask why you've changed
When the rest ain't looking like me

[Outro: Joji]
Ooh, call my name
Spit at your feet
'Cause I'm alone
Don't call my name
Need some sleep
And sing along
