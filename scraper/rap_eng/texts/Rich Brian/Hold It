Bitch, hold my strap
He don't wanna see me snap
Tryna front on me then see
Who be the quickest to get capped hoe
Rich is my name
Cause I'm stackin' like Cobain
Smokin' on that shit bitch
I'm just gettin' used to all this fame

[Verse 1]
Bitch you claiming you a savage
But you really just a sad bitch
I don't wanna talk with you
We see that you is lame bitch
Thinkin' that you dope
You nothin' like that shit you slang bitch
Catch you in these streets
And imma pop yo ass on gang bitch

All these homeboys looking like a farmer
All these cloutboys all rock designer
None of these lames tryna catch that come up
Bitch don't start shit unless you got your body armor

I don't hit the gym
But I still be tryna flex
Pull up with the mechs
Lookin' like you owe me cash

[Hook]
Bitch, hold my strap
He don't wanna see me snap
Tryna front on me then see
Who be the quickest to get capped hoe
Rich is my name
Cause I'm stackin' like Cobain
Smokin' on that shit bitch
I'm just gettin' used to all this fame

[Verse 2]
50 clip
I don't see nobody tryna hit that lick, I'm 'bout that shit
You can't tell me nothing, you a goddamn bitch
Whip a freak, suckin' dick
You better take yo fuckin' pick
Going on these airplanes every minute
Got me fuckin' sick

Yo bitch, she sucking up like Kirby
Wondered if she pink inside
And if she hairy like some Furby hoe

You say you fresh but boy you rotten
Lookin' like some damn tomatoes
Shut yo mouth or get that [?]

[Hook]
Bitch, hold my strap
He don't wanna see me snap
Tryna front on me then see
Who be the quickest to get capped hoe
Rich is my name
Cause I'm stackin' like Cobain
Smokin' on that shit bitch
I'm just gettin' used to all this fame
