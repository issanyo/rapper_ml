[Verse 1]
Save your explanation
I don't wanna hear it baby
Lay off with your handy work of candy words
You don't get to call me up later

Anyone can do better than you
You can't tell grime from jewels
But I'm too chic for no vendettas
I'll tell you though
It takes a brain to leave and I went to school

[Pre-Chorus]
Whyn't you go and tell that bitch I wish her best of luck
Honey, he gon' make a break for the door when it's too much
He gon' make a beeline for me but I, I won't give no fucks
You're full of shit 24/7 mi corazon
I hope your mama proud she raised a pussy for a son
I won't be there to kiss any wounds when everybody's gone

[Chorus]
'Cause I'll be seeing you never
I'm living free, light as a feather
When you're chilly, alone in December
Just remember, I'll be seeing you never

[Verse 2]
Cruisin' down 11th
Glance to my right, the passenger seat's unoccupied
Here's how I know that we had nothin'
'cause when I'm driving alone
There's no waft of your cologne
I'm so relieved, I swear I could cry
I dodged a bullet when I bid you that fast goodbye
Why, mister you missed a dollar to get you a dime

[Pre-Chorus]
It's bewildering that you would leave a vixen for a snake
You beg me not to hate you so here's what I stipulate
Whyn't you go ahead and pack up your shit
That includes your ugly ass suedes, yeah (That I paid for)
I was so good to you I gave you all my assets a la carte
I let you pick and choose all the desires of your heart
Joke's on you for messing all that up babe
Your foolishness is state of the art

[Chorus]
Guess
I'll be seeing you never
I'm living free, light as a feather
When you're chilly, alone in December
Just remember, I'll be seeing you never

[Outro]
See you never, I'll see you never
See you never, I'll see you never babe
See you never, see you never again
See you never
