[Intro]
Hello, Brian, this is your Grandmother
Um, I don't know if you remember me but
Do you have time to maybe
Meet up and touch base about
You know, talk about life maybe
And catch up you know

[Chorus]
No, no, I don't know, don't be askin' me no more
I just close my door, put the "do not disturb" on
Don't you get too close, you know I'm an animal
Don't want to stay too long, I just get this shit to go
Slo-mo when I move so I do not lose control
Lomo camera every time I fuck your hoe
Airbnb's now, start to feel like second home
She on my dick now, this is just a second song

[Verse 1]
Actin' like a hooligan, I swear I think I'm fuckin' losin' friends
Somebody called me up and told me I'ma meet the president
I said okay then I proceed to leave my friends
And every citizen and everybody where I'm livin', aye-aye
Yes, lawd, bought some Bitcoin, was 'bout to buy some more
She a vegan eatin' seared 'loins, can't commit to love
I ain't Google, I don't give no answers, got the firewall
They keep askin' me about some things that they already know

[Chorus]
No, no, I don't know, don't be askin' me no more
I just close my door, put the the "do not disturb" on
Don't you get too close, you know I'm an animal
Don't want to stay too long, I just get this shit to go
Slo-mo when I move so I do not lose control
Lomo camera every time I fuck your hoe
Airbnb's now, start to feel like second home
She on my dick now, this is just a second song

[Verse 2]
Back in my hometown, got me feeling extra strong
Where I'ma go now, nobody gon' really know
Came with a new sound, just by sitting in my room
Smell hella good now, I been puttin' on perfume
Takin' pictures with the girls, I keep my hits up in my vault
My rhythm still left in the winter, think you gotta wear an extra coat
I'm Tarantino with the shit, directin' music videos
Man, I can sense your cluelessness, don't even interview me, hoe
Hoe, tell your man to go 'cause he been stickin' like some throat coat
I don't like your energy, I skate away like Frozone
You been hearin' things about me and you want to know, know
If it's true or false and then I hit you with the

[Chorus]
No, no, I don't know, don't be askin' me no more
I just close my door, put the "do not disturb" on
Don't you get too close, you know I'm an animal
Don't want to stay too long, I just get this shit to go
Slo-mo when I move so I do not lose control
Lomo camera every time I fuck your hoe
Airbnb's now, start to feel like second home
She on my dick now, this is just a second song
