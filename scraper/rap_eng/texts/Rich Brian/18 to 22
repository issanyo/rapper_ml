Young fool out of school, not sure what to do
So much time on your hands, with nothing to do
Got no skills to make deals, or even pay bills
Ain't gone work for Mickey D’s and clean up spills
Your homies ride up and he’s sitting on them ports
Cell phone type ride and he’s puffing on a torch
What’s up for the weekend, hello, what you’re thinking
Party on the eastside, you know we be drinking
Appreciate it dog, that might be just what I need
Have some fun, wild out, live life with some speed
The party fellas flossing, blue racks with no precaution
Honeys with hair-dos saying hell yea it cost him
Dj music hitting so many women to get in
Super game spitting, sorry it won’t be no tricking
Young G’s don’t spend cash, just to get sex
Got to have candy paint and the Caddy to flex

So what’s next? Hot sex, your mama house or mine
Make up your mind quick
Cause we’re running out of time
She will park it on the couch about half pass nine
Come on baby I want you cause you’re looking so fine

Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while
Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while
Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while
Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while

Birds and the bees getting wild on the couch
She’s wilding, drunk to, first time taking it in the mouth
Never did none of that’s for sure no doubt

But what do you expect when you’re alone in the house
So hella good nothing else can get with this
Went bare back bc you’re a pull out speaclist
New to use a rubber from the very first kiss
Didn’t find the time, hoping for a blank in this
Fools rush in with a wise fear of the –
Is she knocked up going all through your head
Now you ask yourself, do I even love her
Would have been a lot easier if you used a rubber
But if she is, that’s just one mistake
One little ol’ baby won't seal my fate
I wanted a job before, but now I need it bad
Child support payments make my baby mama glad
In a dead end job, and I get no respect
Child support payments coming all out my check
I got to a better job just to up my cash
Fools raise child support, they can kiss my ass


Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while
Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while
Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while
Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while

The only thought I have left is to live the street life
I got to late start so I ain't serving right
Complaining smoked out fool’s bout the size of my white
Slap my hand, snatch my cash, ran off in the night
Told my homies what happened
Yall tripping stop laughing
Busta’s hurt my feelings
Lose control and start blasting
Shot my own homie and really didn’t mean it
I can’t lie about to many families seen it
Every fool in my hood hate me and want to see me dead
Ain't nobody left to trust and I’m crying in my bed
I said mama I love but I done had enough
Life had beat me down and I can’t get up
Stressed out beat down and I’m tired of living
If my homies don’t get me, I’ll spend time in prison
Unload my pistol, outside with my unloaded gun
Jack an on duty cop and take his honey bun
Put my pistol in my pants as I face the cop
Draw at any time, our lives got to stop
I draw, he draws, just like the unforgiven
Thank god for cop, because I was tired of living

Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while
Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while
Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while
Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while
Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while
Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while
Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while
Eighteen to twenty-two you’re hella wild
Won't you wait a while
