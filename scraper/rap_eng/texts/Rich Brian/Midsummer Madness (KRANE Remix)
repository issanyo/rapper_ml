[Intro: NIKI]
Rules, rules, rules
Rules, rules, rules

[Verse 1: AUGUST 08]
Make it make sense
Make it make sense, I
Can't hide a heart in a black tint, I
You were off the bullshit and the tablets
Under 21, both savage
All these blurry nights feel the same to me
Heart full of hate, no vacancy
Only one you gonna blame when it's over
Can't look me in my eyes when you sober
Hey, I'm the one you call when you feelin' low
Running up a check just to help you cope
I just want to live in the moment
You just want to fight 'cause you lonely
Tryna see a milly then be really up
Rockstar crash in my Bentley truck
You need all my love
You've got all the love

[Chorus: joji]
Last night, I lost all my patience
You were fucked up, I was wasted
Midsummer madness
I can't take it no more, no more
Fuck the ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-u-oh
Fuck the ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-u-oh

[Verse 2: Rich Brian]
Been a minute since I heard you wanna stay as friends
I learned from my mistakes, you make me want to learn again
I don't really see the problem, it's a risk I wanna take
You say "let's see where it goes" but I don't really wanna wait
Ayy, look and listen up
You've been smiling when we fuck
Let's not even think about it, we ain't gotta talk a lot
Make it hotter than the summer, I'll stay with you when it's not
Put the slow jams on, I wanna see you make it pop, ayy
Moving all around the bed like we just toss and turn, ayy
Playin' with the fire, I don't care if I get burned, ayy
I'ma treat you good like you've been waitin' for your turn, ayy
Nothing in the universe feel better than your tongue, ayy
'Bout to go home, I know you finna come with
I'm playing these games like a pimp on the strip
Conversations late night about how we gonna live
I don't got the answer to it, all I'm finna say IS

[Chorus: joji & DZ]
Fuck the ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-u-oh
Fuck the ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-u-oh

[Verse 3: DZ]
當光灑進了 white Porsche
I never felt so good
Call me DJ Knowknow, oh-oh no
播放列表歌很夠
你點頭我心裡會滿足
博物館給了更多感悟
在天文台半山道漫步
拼LA夜景的版圖
Fuck the rules
距離不是問題, I know
為了這一刻的feel我值得飛了那麼久
She lookin' so pretty, I wanted a kiss
把beautiful memories 存入我的iPhone X
I,I,I hope 24 can become 48
看日落 粉的天 有藍月亮陪
想要擁抱 你在我需要前給
Sunny gone, I don't care, you're my sunshine babe

[Outro: Joji]
I don't feel control
I'm better on my own
I'm used to being so gone for way too long
Long, long, long
