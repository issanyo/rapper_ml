[Verse 1]
Out of reach
Out of time
Maybe I'm too high
Out of mind
Out of line
Almost lost my sight
I don't know why I do this
I feel like I might lose you
Out of drugs, out of love (oh)
So let's compromise

[Pre-Chorus]
The floor is raising, the sky is falling
The tides are turning, my eyes are burning

[Chorus]
Head in the clouds
And I'm not coming down
I used to swim now I'm ready to sink
I wanna give you what I can not do
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Hate our haze
Different days
Maybe I'm too nice
In a maze, in a daze
How to read your signs
I knew that I was foolish
I was young and I was stupid
Never change, never take
Thereâ€™s no compromise

[Pre-Chorus]
The floor is raising, the sky is falling
The tides are turning, my eyes are burning

[Chorus]
Head in the clouds
And I'm not coming down
I used to swim now I'm ready to sink
I wanna give you what I can not do
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
