[Intro]
Woah, Yeah, Uh, Ay

[Verse 1]
Back on my bullshit man you can't believe it
Who the fuck just said I should quit, they gon' prolly take it back
We make the people book it, see the zeros goin' up
And we just gettin' started, why you always talkin' shit
Go look at your deposit, always got excuses
But I never see the problem, why you never made it yet
Talkin all that shit, but you never seem to back it up
I don't blame you if I were you I would be mad as fuck
Run it run it back, stop makin' false accusations
I didn't go international that's where I fuckin started
Then I went local all of you fuckers start recognizing
You too focused bout appearances and flexin' for nobody
God damn, every move I do is on the cam, if I say another word
I might just end up on the gram, lookin' at this year's blueprint
You know it's full of plans, yo career is goin' slow no need to take another xan

[Hook]
I don't even know you please get the fuck up off me
Know it's never personal I don't trust nobody
I'm just gettin' in the game no time for the nani
I'mma do what I need please just let me do me
I don't even know you please get the fuck up off me
Know it's never personal I don't trust nobody
I'm just gettin' in the game no time for the nani
I'mma do what I need please just let me do me

[Verse 2]
H-H-Hotels got me sleepin' well, every week a new touchdown like I'm Odell
Now he's talkin' bout his lifestyle if you couldn't tell that it's all he fuckin' talk about, man we can't relate
Shit what can I say I don't look rich, I don't wear a golden chain, I don't drive a cool whip, this only way I can flex
For your main bitch, I'm just sayin' what I feel had it with the fake shit
Can't forget about me cuz I'm always on the timeline
I been learning bout the market got me on the limelight
Never been speaker I just think of shit like Einstein
Never make the wrong move I look at shit with hindsight
Yea man, hold my glass, boutta take my shot she better catch
Hit that ass got me reminiscing bout the past, you don't get the picture
Always gotta take em with the flash, hip game on hourglass (shit)

[Hook]
I don't even know you please get the fuck up off me
Know it's never personal I don't trust nobody
I'm just gettin' in the game no time for the nani
I'mma do what I need please just let me do me
I don't even know you please get the fuck up off me
Know it's never personal I don't trust nobody
I'm just gettin' in the game no time for the nani
I'mma do what I need please just let me do me

[Outro]
Let me do me
Please just let me do me
