[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll

[Post-Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll

[Verse 1: Rich Chigga]
Yeah, uh
Bankroll city pay slow
Everybody on the payroll under control
Every twenty minutes change clothes
Shout out my boy Post only that
You wanna say go if you say so, uh
Run up in the scene in my tight jean shorts
Looking like a pimp but I got one hoe
Try to shut me up and I say hell no
Never switching up, only switch up flows
Bling blau, honey on the carousel
She get looking at me now
And she hit me when in town
She thirsty like she in a drought
Does she want to fuck no doubt
Living life like a king
I ain't even got a crown, ay
Hundred bands, hundred bands
Hold up bitch I got hundred thousand in my pillow case
You can try me run it with the Nike
But you'll never do it in my pace
Hundred racks, hundred racks
Hold up hoe, this is my first time in the States
My aura so bright but my bars so dark
You would think you wanna sack up face

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll

[Post-Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll

[Verse 2: Wyllable]
I possess many bankroll
And the headphones as I keep prankcallin'
Chicks go west, women gang falls in
Love, fuck hoes' ass on trampoline
What I'ma do is to swang, ball
And party, they call me Ken doll
Tease a bitch with my skank troll
Deliberately smash her ankles
Smack, maul and drag tall hoes
'Cause they actually fake thralls
When the maids bawl, play song of this fuckin' man named Jake Paul
Until that small (that small) ear bleeds and slap 'em to the blank wall
Stab all asshole's' dang skulls
Hit 'em pussies like ejectin' Aang's soul

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll

[Post-Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Got a blue bankroll, my money don't fold
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll

[Verse 3: Rephrase]
My face is smeared with no eggrolls
2 fingers in her vagina like a chopstick
Solo sexist at her best, I snuffle the sperm stain on her pink
Polo necks, stick it in her pussy like a coin
Call it vending machine for gigolo cheques
Your Ovary's Lit One, swear to God, #YOLO
Next, fucked Grace Vanderwaal while she was drinkin' vodka
Whipped her butt with her sport bra
But she did ballet with polka
Just pulled out these ho's brown nipples, lookin' like Willy Wonka
Bleeded then blacked out 'cause she used that dildo 'til it conked out
(Get in bunker, motherfucker!)

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
