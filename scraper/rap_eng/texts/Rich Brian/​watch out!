[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4

[Chorus]
They be salty like sodium
I just do my shit and I'm turning up the volume
Fuck a foreign whip, man, the Uber's what I rode in
Yeah, my shit so flames Elon Musk could prolly sell it, amen
A, B, C, D, E, time for your ass to leave
I just need time for me, if you don't, you, we gon' see
1-9-9-9, hide your bitch 'cause I'm here
I've got nowhere to be, 88 be the team

[Verse 1]
Taking on the whole world and we learning quick, uh
While you out here actin' like a mothafuckin' bitch
Can't you see, can't you see? I'm so cold like Febreze
I've been up for two weeks, I feel like countin' sheeps (countin' sheeps)
Doin' numbers like I'm Ed Sheeran
Movin' with my A-team, yeah we staying coherent
Mind so deep, you will prolly die if you go jump in it
Only thing I do is cook some food and mind my own business (yurr)

[Chorus]
They be salty like sodium
I just do my shit and I'm turning up the volume
Fuck a foreign whip, man, the Uber's what I rode in
Yeah, my shit so flames Elon Musk could prolly sell it, amen
A, B, C, D, E, time for your ass to leave
I just need time for me, if you don't, you, we gon' see
1-9-9-9, hide your bitch 'cause I'm here
I've got nowhere to be, 88 be theâ€“

[Verse 2]
I just say the number in my head, then I make it, ayy
I just killed that pussy, send your thoughts and your prayers, ayy
I don't need to see your pasty face, see you later, ayy
Go ahead and tell me 'bout how long you just waited, ayy
She call me papi, she murder my meat
Leave with no warnin', leave when I want it
Intimidate, little bitch, I'll make you vomit
I put a line, when I do you do not cross it
Too high to say nothin' or be normal for a second
I just gotta tell you something, man, this shit gon' last forever
My guys, they don't need no strap to smoke you
They be doin' Muay Thai
Gettin' physical like PE is a subject
Saw a pretty girl, I'm like "Baby, where you from?"
Long brown hair, she got that shit from Amazon

[Chorus]
They be salty like sodium
I just do my shit and I'm turning up the volume
Fuck a foreign whip, man, the Uber's what I rode in
Yeah, my shit so flames Elon Musk could prolly sell it, amen
A, B, C, D, E, time for your ass to leave
I just need time for me, if you don't, you, we gon' see
1-9-9-9, hide your bitch 'cause I'm here
I've got nowhere to be, 88 be the team (yuh)
