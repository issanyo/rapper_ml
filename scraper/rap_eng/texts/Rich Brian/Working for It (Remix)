[Verse 1: ZHU]
You've been working here all night long
Let me see if I can give you better
Even when I'm far and gone
I know you're working for it
You've been working here all night long
Let me see if I can give you better
Even when I'm far and gone
I know you're working for it
I know you're working for it
I know you're working for it

[Chorus: ZHU]
I'll make you better
(I know you're working for it)
(Money on my mind)
I'll make you better
(I know you're working for it)
(Eyes on the dollar sign)
I'll make you better
(I know you're working for it)
(Money on my mind)
I'll make you better
(Eyes on the dollar sign)

[Verse 2: Rich Chigga]
All I want is just the money
Pockets at the gym 'cause they got a lil' chubby
Never go out on a limb, not ya friend I'm not ya buddy
7 zeros be the flow, stew dough
With the hoes going faster than a motherfuckin' rally
Never seen nobody flossin' like this
Bank roll over reporters, s'why I named myself Rich
Put in work, never worry 'bout a goading-ass bitch
Why you hating when the resum√© got the dollar signs in it?
Working too hard, always got that back pain
Every single night, I hit the port or the airplane
Only time I's running when the cheques told me roll lanes
Driving home, speeding past the cars when it's two lanes

[Verse 3: THEY.]
She want it all
She working hard for the money, she want it all
She want it all? She want it all
She working hard for the money, she want it all

[Verse 1: ZHU]
You've been working here all night long
Let me see if I can give you better
Even when I'm far and gone
I know you're working for it

[Chorus: ZHU]
I'll make you better
(Money on my mind, money on my mind)
I'll make you better
(Eyes on the dollar sign, eyes on the dollar sign)
I'll make you better
(Money on my mind, money on my mind)
(Travaillant pour elle)
I'll make you better

[Verse 4: Rich Chigga]
Ay, dancin' in the crib
Lil' shawty with a ass, she tryna strip
Man, I shoulda brought the rubber, but she lickin' on my tip
I'm on my young shit, lights off, cuddle in the bed
I'm on my dumb shit, clothes off, rubbin' on her clit
Why you talkin' all that shit?
Why you mad that I'm not lettin' your little pussy-ass win
On a trip with Skrillex and he probably wanna trip
Young boy told the world that I'm always off the shit, sike
Fetty, fetty, fetty
Always workin' hard, but she never get the credit
Erryday gettin' paid, every night she go and shred it
Long dick, long pants, all she wanna do is grab it

[Outro: THEY.]
She want it all
She working hard for the money, she want it all
(Travaillant pour elle)
She want it all? She want it all
She working hard for the money, she want it all
