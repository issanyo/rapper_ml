[Chorus: AUGUST 08]
Diamonds stay disrespectin' (disrespectful nigga)
Whole clique's some veterans, you can tell by their necklace
Came through with the extras (extras, extras, wooo)
If they poppin' set we gon air 'em out like a mattress
Hey, I just took your bitch
Diamonds dance like J-Lo hips (hey)
We fly high as shit, 80 gang is reckless (hey)
Watch us all get rich
Spent 10 racks just on the kicks (hey)
Better hide your bitch
Disrespect all on my wrist

[Verse 1: Rich Brian]
Tell your man, he don't get my respect
Throw the man five bands, and he'd never collect
Got a bitch that dance, and she came from the 'jects
Never hold my hand, but her booty is fat
Got my eye up on the gold, the riots happened at my show
She cryin' 'cause yo ass is buyin' diamonds from the local mart
Never hit a bitch, never popped a pill, never stole a single fucking thing 'cept for your bitch ass
Then your ass in my thoughts so you can swim fast
I spat like a goat gon' make you eat grass
One, two, three, four, five
We're about to take off to Dubai
Never learned how to drive, but bitch I fly
Pussy the only thing in my eyesight
Ayy

[Chorus: AUGUST 08]
Diamonds stay disrespectin'
Whole clique's some veterans, you can tell by their necklace
Came through with the extras (extras, extras, wooo)
If they poppin' set we gon air 'em out like a mattress
Hey, I just took your bitch
Diamonds dance like J-Lo hips (hey)
Hey, we fly high as shit, 80 gang is reckless (hey)
Watch us all get rich
Spent 10 racks just on the kicks (hey)
Better hide your bitch
Disrespect all on my wrist

[Verse 2: DZ & MaSiWei]
我的項鍊怎麼那麼閃?
我的手錶全鑲了鑽
你愛偷看我Instagram
Breaking to bad you are pink man
I got too many style like B2K
I got too many bitches wanna come to my bed
Mr. enjoy the money 會得到屬於他的cash
摘下面具看著我的scar face
我變的不止一點點
不想聽的話 隨便你說幾遍
給你耳朵嘴巴貼個創口貼
等我回來看你還能狂幾天
Going crazy they do mosh pit
Super flashy you know what is it
I’m waiting my new AP bust down
先把五個十字架掛脖子上

[Chorus: AUGUST 08]
Diamonds stay disrespectin' (whoo)
Whole clique's some veterans, you can tell by their necklace
Came through with the extras (extras, extras, wooo)
If they poppin' set we gon air 'em out like a mattress
Hey, I just took your bitch
Diamonds dance like J-Lo hips (hey)
We fly high as shit, 80 gang is reckless (hey)
Watch us all get rich
Spent 10 racks just on the kicks (hey)
Better hide your bitch
Disrespect all on my wrist

[Verse 3: Melo]
Be my man, and be my fans, be my family
困難的日子裡抱歉我又不認識你
不用去 pretend
幾百萬都爬開 you are not my friend
Calling my flow sick making the music
航班到紐約 hol' up, hol' up
我說完全沒得問題很ok
製造so many new shit 直接讓你們休克 hol' up, hol' up
You don't understand
Different from others, only me special
I will bounce back
How to be a man
Let me tell you who is a real friend
Give me so show 一幫mooch跟隨在你後頭
Iceberg帶在脖子上cool
Take a photo

[Chorus: AUGUST 08]
Diamonds stay disrespectin'
Whole clique's some veterans, you can tell by their necklace
Came through with the extras (extras, extras, woo)
If they poppin' set we gon air 'em out like a mattress
Hey, I just took your bitch
Diamonds dance like J-Lo hips (hey)
We fly high as shit, 80 gang is reckless (hey)
Watch us all get rich
Spent 10 racks just on the kicks (hey)
Better hide your bitch
Disrespect all on my wrist
