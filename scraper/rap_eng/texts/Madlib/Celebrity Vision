[Verse 1: Hemlock Ernst]
Celebrity the vision in my face before I left her
Bottom of the circus, we were twins of silver circuits
Red and blue pills, with a two dollar purpose
Love ain’t a dollar sign, drug me up on wine
Heart ain’t the mushy kind, fleshy pulpy lime
Now it’s cable ready able willing, ill-refined
Ill will spill from my hand like a foreign bill
Pass me my landing card, story board and chlorophyl
Not much else, left to do today though
Blow through a smokestack
Sip a volcano
Apes drank drano
When Cain ate Abel
I Betty like Grabel
Talking to her like she paid though
She gets full service cuz i work with no conscience
Used to be a lover, now a fighter and a monster
Once a Henry Fonda, now an anaconda
A predator of posture
Walk the line before the concert
Stomp out the stage lights
Show you how to work
Keep it real humble -- then again i’m in my workshirt
Make em eat earth
To teach them bout my birthplace
Forgot her for a moment, straight tears rollin down my face
You never forget that
Like opposites attract, i polish the 'Lib scratch

[Verse 2: Hemlock Ernst]
Put your anger in a proper place
Jar it up and sell it
Wanna be a millionaire
Then you live the story -- tell it
Tired of hearing bout that fake shit
You bake shit? I build shit
You take shit? I make gangsters feel shit
That real shit
No apologies, people call me lottery
Arrogant monopoly I run on pens and pottery
Spin you up a sipping bowl
Ashtray or kitchen tool
Momma raised me right but that pussy make me act a fool
Sometimes cool, sit around and think about it
Death and taxes on my mind nobody wanna hear about it
Trust must bleed, lust busts seed
Dust off my dick, took a week to think about some shit
Now i’m bout to split, out the house
Down to corner store
Get a 3-pack, 12-pack then go hit the bar
Pushed through the glass all barstools took
Used to know everybody, now just a couple homies
Seen this one hottie, she look like biscotti
My brain thinkin, probably she taste like it, honestly
I feel heavy bodily
Nerves like pasta
Tired of hunting strange
Feel the dread like a rasta
About to be the same situation that I left
Self-evaluating, hating, had me wanna go and hurt myself
