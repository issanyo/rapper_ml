What's up world
Forward pass the weak so don't sleep
I got my man M-E-D in the house
We got some conversations for you this evening
So pay attention, this is real..

[Verse 1: Declaime]
Fire from the sky
And so many people dying
Can you hear the baby's crying?
Chaos and destruction
Hate and separation's, how we function
So me and M-E-D had to say a little something
So how infinite we're filled with spirit
Time's up, always just soon dry up
Like water in a thirsty ground
Still as a stillborn never heard a sound
Of their momma's voice
Never had a chance never had a choice
We're so mcs that don't achieve
And all creeps believe in greed
And that's real

[Verse 2: Medaphoar]
I'm stuck in them last days
Down the fast lane
Time don't, wait won't catch me
In the same place
Folks take note
Knock up in a nigga face
Most's faith, peep for the snakes
[??] niggas two face
Here comes the truth
Seem that's too late
For most of these lost souls
They're dead weight
Set it straight don't let them lies
Of the shady see your faith
Get your tapes stay true to the dying date

Man did you see those two buildings
On their film?, On CNN?
"Haha, what're you telling me?"
Ain't no joke..

[Verse 3: Declaime]
Did you see the twin towers fall
And how it did affect us all
How it led us to see
This world just ain't what it used to be
Way too much poverty
And are we truly free? No!
They use terror as their tools
Half ass teachers in their schools
They lay the law we break the rules
We go to jail this earth's in hell
'Til death where you park [??]
These are the last and final days

I just can't cope
In this world full of lies
Pull the wool over our eyes
I rather be dead than be misled
This is how I feel and so what it said [2x]

[Verse 4: Medaphoar]
I'm stuck in them last days
Down the fast lane
Time don't, wait won't catch me
In the same place
Folks take note
Knock up in a nigga face
Most's faith, peep for the snakes
[??] niggas two face
Here comes the truth
Seem that's too late
For most of these lost souls
They're dead weight
Set it straight don't let them lies
Of the shady see your faith
Get your tapes stay true to the dying date
