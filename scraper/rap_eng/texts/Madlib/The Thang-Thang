*You're tuned to a special edition*
*With Madlib taking over the airwaves*

(Give me my goddamned cheeseburger)

*Different strokes for different folks*
*Don't be ashamed mother fucker raise your hands*

[Verse 1: Prince Po]
Prince Po
Calico flow, nasty habits
Yeah
Ow!
Why you hogging dog, pass that
Mass it, the sweat splash down your asscrack
Peel out
But roll something before you jump on the five
Alley cat on the rise like NASDAQ
Love when i lick her inner thighs, ooh
I seen you with that bitch but wasn't gonna say nothing
But you treat a sister good while other cats stay fronting
In other words boy, we good tonight
Prince Po, ghetto love, I bring the hood to the mic
Its so real like (?) I'm all night
Can't even sling some crack without some skill
Bob Barkin', spark if the price is right
Do what you feel

[Break: Various Samples]

[Verse 2: Prince Po]
Two girl
Touch yourself and let the world konw
Hip-hop is love, step with Prince Po
I'm not a thing thug but I'm kind of slick
Toe to toe
Back in the mix with some lyrics to go
I throw stones, the stones throw out hardcore joints
To make bones grow
Peaceful, but a beast with the 44
Never go out my reach for the cho-cho
You be tricking but snitch is a no-no
Underground gritty gorilla gargantua romancin' ya
Barry White ya 'til its time to go
(?) tell me to pee on, emcees be  gone
These ice cold flows getting hot girls dancing
Klingon

[Verse 3: Prince Po]
Reactivate 'em
Marinate 'em
Nasty habits flavors straight cajun
Claim you Jamaican but you hate (?)
Quick to flush (?) and can't replace a razor
Cats claim the best smoke
I'm just blazin'
Lyrics vivid, just ask Wes Craven
Feel my heavy metal rock, Iron Maiden
I'm far from the plantation
But I'm still slavin'
(?) misbehavin'
Good business player
Certified heavy weight when I'm awaited
Lyrically out of shape dogs you whack and lack training
I'm on Access like (?) and Matt Damon
