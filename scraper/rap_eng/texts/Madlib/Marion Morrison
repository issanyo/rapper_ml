[Verse 1]
The world is unjust
So I don't plan to do the beat justice
DOOM set the bar so high it's got the munchies
Here we are, check the breath
Forget the mic, discover if I'm dumb or deaf
Ask me how I embody legacy, it's no games
I'm here to match the set
Bet for five and I'm countin' on ten
Stones Throw paid the man and I gave them cassettes
And they sold like it wasn't a dead medium
Then he could feel the ghost of those that preceded him
No presumptions
Here to crush and watch people malfunction like Johnny Five or somethin'
But it ain't easy winnin' over fans who's waitin' for Jaylib 5 and Madvillain 7
That's why I'm working everyday
I realize the asshole that's parked in my space
And by those I mean the weakly ignoramus with nice teeth, abs and got some dumb shit to say
You and I are not in the same lane
I speak deathbed regardless of where the cards lay
Best cover your heart with Leba spray
You shouldn't touch this brother like a wet coat of paint
I'm here to force the rap world motion
To the final frontier, be it space or ocean
I came king from a towel boy, know my name Jonwayne
Iller than that fucking actor cowboy

(Ahh, don't clap, you know you don't mean that shit)

[Verse 2]
Aw, fuck you, I'm on the fringe, Mackelmore ain't got shit on me
The next person to give me the white handicap
Daps gets diced like the cheese that you beat
Get slapped like the beats of ????
Rest in peace
The bass never cease, the coffin never creaks
'Til I'm deceased, but my fans plead with me to keep singing decrees
I will, when I'm up in the scene, I can feel the whole room sink 100 degrees
As if it couldn't handle their mind free of disease, they put on their pleather jackets and leave
They don't wanna hear the truth
They'd rather turn up, pop molly and shoot the juice
You would rather do lines then hear 'em
So I'm on the backburner as I contemplate the serum
Not the syrup, dammit, don't make me stir up the pot and smoke you out like the Neighborhood Watch
So what I got the hood watchin', I been had the coast buzzin' from Long Beach to Stockton
But I still got a long way
I'm hoping this mixtape will take me over the bay
Even your Momma knows I deserve it by getting the platinum plaque for outstanding service
I'm here to force the rap world motion
To the final frontier, be it space or ocean
I came king from a towel boy, know my name Jonwayne
Iller than that fucking actor cowboy
