[Verse 1]
Cute girls with boob jobs
Light blonde hair, blue nikes and white tube socks
New school
Wash down Vicodins with juice box
Madchild get so stressed I say oosa
Oosa
Your arrogance offends me
Terribly urgently
My therapy's a Bentley
To true addict
Mad pure as dope on the street like blue magic
Get you hoppin' like a frog leaps
Stop you then I drop you then I chop you into dog meat
The mighty legion of heroes is calling
Temples are burning, the statues are falling
Get swept from the earth, it's destruction
A sacrifice after my birth
Order execution
Release me from beast, keep your distance
Master and apprentice, Disaster for a dentist
Bastard with a pack of matches, gasoline and vengeance
Faster than a engine while I'm blastin' up a sentence
I have to be an end of me, I'm actually pretending
I'm smashin' while i'm thrashin'
These graphics are authentic
Half of us are pacifists the other half are venting
