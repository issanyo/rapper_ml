Spazzing over the minor seizure
Little needle
You sleeping on me
With a large dose of anesthesia

I feel it in the slumber
Blow smoke thru the muffler
Put it on your eyes
It’s a slice of a cucumber

Hit the trombone
Piano
Laid back relax
Dumb flow
I’m flying to my future I’m dumbo

Nuts hung low
Portable bungalows
Move mo
Cash snow
I know I stack those
With bad hoes

Girls ain’t the main attraction
Cut them in half portions fractions of the masses
3 strike chances

Transition with the bad kids
Detention
After classes
I wonder if it’s packed yet
They couldn’t track it

The monster in the basement
Crack accolades on ya shoulder blade
Excalibur swinging thru the pavement

Grab the markers
The pencils the pens
Use the cement with a spray can
If you plan to attend

The public assembly
I kill instrumentally
Just let it be
Telepathy
Testing me
With yellow bees

I drop the stingers In the grass
Flip the words
So I can mix match
Get stung with the tip of the mask

It’s all caps when you say the name
This ain’t a waiting game
A patient with no patience
Are the hardest beasts to tame

Fix the pipe for the track
While I’m bar bending
Transcending
Word flexing
Beginning with an ending

End it where I start the verse
Saliva served with lava
That’s a lot of pasta
Tossed and observed in the universe

Your careers leans more than the tower of Pisa
Don’t know your name
Like first day teachers
With amnesia

Reply and I’ll answer faster than a cheetah
Please speak up

Take a final breath before I leave ya
