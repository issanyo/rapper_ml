Before we go any further I'd like to show you all a game I made up. This game is called "Sounds of the Studio", and it can be played with any record, including this one

You can play it, uh, with... you can play it with your favorite record - you may be surprised. Now if you have a pair of headphones you better get 'em out and get 'em cranked up 'cause they're really gonna help you on this one

Now I'm sure you all recognize this. (hissing noise) This is called hiss. It comes on records that were mastered lousy, or, uh, mono re-processed for stereo, or any number of things

(Humming noise) This of course, is hum

P's popping - This is the sound of bad editing

And here's what happens when the machine gains control and mangles your tape. Punch... outs

Now all you have to do is find these sounds on the record, and whoever finds the most wins of course
But don't-
