You know I wanna give my best love to you...
You know I wanna give my best love, it's true

Heard they bombing Libya, it puts me in a mood
Heard they bombing Africa, puts me in a mood

You and me, we can make a difference if we try now
Just you and me, we can make a difference if we try now

You know I wanna give my best love to you...
You know I wanna give my best love, it's true

You and me, we can make a difference if we try now
Just you and me, we can make a difference if we try now

You know I wanna give my best love to you...
You know I wanna give my best love, it's true

Ooh what's going down in the Congo, put me in a mood
Seems like everywhere in the world there's pain my dear, and that puts me in a mood baby! Ooh baby

But You and me, we can make a difference if we try now
Just you and me, we can make a difference if we try now

Come on baby don't be late
Ain't got time to hesitate, come on baby please don't wait
I need ya, need ya! Got so much work to do

Give me a $100 dollars to build a well in Africa
And make it betta, betta!

Give me $50 dollars boo to build a well in India...
Give me $20 dollars boo to build a well in Mexico, make it betta, betta...
And then feel betta!
Why don't we make it good for real?
