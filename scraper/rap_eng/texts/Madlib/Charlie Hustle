[Verse I: Krondon]
To often, Kron’s caught for arson, scorching
Caution, protect your noggin, far some
The common murder rate to lawmen, charging
More ghetto real estate to auction, pardon
The daisy dukes, Dolly Parton, hard nipples
Triple X, twin tossin’, eight drive adrenaline
IPod feelin’, what more than big shillings want to feed children
Not ham, hogs, and chittlins, best beginnings
Don’t need the best endings without winning
The lawsuit pending, no pension, career of addiction
Bumping New Edition out the German engineering
Melle or Boondocks, Biggie or 2Pac
Both a tell the truth about the youth in the soon lockup
Every market is a registered target till we've finished what we have started

[Chorus: Phil Da Agony]
Yeah, and we just getting started with this
Get on your job and get gone
Put in your work then go home

[Verse II: Phil Da Agony]
Thousand-dollar Loui loafers, silk socks
I come from the only planet that rocks
Go on and hand me down a planet that’ll never stop
I put the thirteen on the rocks, never catch me drinking Ciroc
I pop off like gun shots, hotter than red dot pointed at your knot
You get it on it from the words that I drop
Disappointed I ain’t get to the top, still happy that I get what I got
Stick to the plot, I mean, hey, look at Barack
That’s a ---- you can learn from a lot
Campaigning you can rise to the top
Champagning when there’s bottles to pop
Special ops with the intricate plots
Top notch and it’s sticking like scotch
Give it all that you got, Backwoods burn a colorful crops
Fuck the others, Imma smother guac
This for the mothers and my brothers on lock

[Chorus: Phil Da Agony]
Get on your job and get gone
Put in your work then go home
