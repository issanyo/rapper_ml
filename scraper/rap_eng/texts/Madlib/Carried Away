I guess I got a little carried away
I guess I got a little carried away
I guess I got a little carried away
I guess I got a little carried away
I guess I got a little carried away

[Verse 1]
Met her at the comedy club
Connected more than I expected, didn't think we'd hook up
I wasn't looking for love but she was easy to talk to
Positive and intelligent, can't easily walk through
Sent her a message, she responds down for whatever
We'll stroll in the park, unless there's bad weather
Walking together seeing striking similarities
I think it was a date, but I'm biking there for clarity
The next time I see her I'm gonna flirt
We ate tapas for dinner, she kissed me for dessert
Now is when I'd get defensive but I'm open and I'm falling
And I'm hoping I can see her, and I'm texting and I'll calling
I'm committed, what woman doesn't want commitment?
I'm telling my friends potential is infinite
In the perfect neighborhood, love her apartment when I visit
Envision myself as a tenant

I guess I got a little carried away
I guess I got a little carried away
I guess I got a little carried away
I guess I got a little carried away

[Verse 2]
She and I were thriving, I'm telling everybody
Want her to meet my friends, inviting her to parties
Memorizing the age and location of her brothers
Preparing to meet her sister, learning about her mother
I've known her for three weeks, but I'm pretty sure I love her
Planning activities outside the city for next summer
She's going to school soon and it would be a bummer if she left town
But I'll touch down like Plummer
I'm talking about the future, she talked about it lesser
I'm sharing all my feelings, she winks and gestures, I found it cute
She's fallen ill so I'll bring her soup
Keep her company while she recoups, not in the greatest mood?
It's cool, when she gets better there's so much to do
Couldn't imagine being used, it felt so new
I'm having fun, there's no one else that I would choose
I think that she might be the one

[Hook]
I guess I got a little carried away
I guess I got a little carried away
I guess I got a little carried away
I guess I got a little carried away
I guess I got a little c...

[Verse 3]
Hadn't seen her in four days, I'm fiending
She just got back from Philly and her energy was leaning in the opposite direction
Said she hadn't been alone enough
I was too happy to see her to notice that her tone was rough
She asked me to leave, figured she'd reach out in the morning and apologize
Next day was silent, I'm in mourning
I wanna ask what's going on but she wants space
Plus if I don't, maybe she'll think I don't care
Sent her a text in case what happened is something we can repair
I'm about to leave the state, she wants to meet before I leave, a netural meeting place
I know she's breaking up with me now, you should have seen my face
I wasn't eating so it wasn't something that I ate
All I could do was wait, I'm bracing for my fate
Call on my friends and family to help me lift the weight
Try not to feel ashamed, nor hyperventilate
Arrived a little late, we small talked and then she said she wasn't feeling great
And didn't feel the same, needed to be alone, and that I'm not to blame
The timing's right, many commitments end of summer brings
And now I'm realizing my girlfriend was a summer fling
The funny thing's I knew, I saw it coming 'cause I've done it too
Feeling the guilt that someone's hurt by you
Reeling, I built us up to be something that wasn't true
I'd be less crushed if I played it cool

[Hook]
I guess I got a little carried away
I guess I got a little carried away
I guess I got a little carried away
I guess I got a little carried away, a little carried away
A little carried away, a little carried away

[Outro: Chris Rock]
If you've been dating a man for four months
And you haven't met any of his friends
You are not his girlfriend
