[Verse 1]
Okay, we party from country to country with more respect
The game with the movement of the hustle
The promoting each step
Ever since microphones were clinched
Drop exclusive for your eardrums
You can still smell the stench up in each venue
Continue to bring out the wild up in you
The doors open, you gonna rush the floor
Motivatin', they play you
Know a brother from Cali, came out to spread love
In the form of music
Knockin' like a head does noddin'
Unanimous agreement that a brother never left
Just misunderstood, step out from the oxy caps
Can feel the breath
Landed in Norway like, no way
I'm really up in this side of the globe
Let's let this old player see what happens
When an actual intellect rap, yo
Walkin' the streets of Oslo, using my headphones as a city map
And as a matter of fact
The boom-bap still attack
The kids comin' up, Lootpack
Glad to see you're back, cat
Oh shit, that's what's up
I acknowledge, give 'em big ups
I know when to step it
The mind's a true weapon in the right hands
The tongue is a caliber
When posted up in front of mic stands
Come on, my peeps, they grind

[Hook]
Waitin' to shine on the streets all day
Dues been paid, so tired of foreplay
Life strugglin', stress jugglin' always
Let's see what happens when they let the soul play
It's for the best if we progress a little bit
Make amends and we break bread a little bit
Reflect and take it back, just for a little bit
Take time, then we'd all shine a lil' bit
Progress a little bit
Break bread a little bit
Take it back, just for a little bit
Then we'd all shine a lil' bit

[Verse 2]
Fresh off some more frequent flyer mileage
A two hour flight to Norway
So comfortable, I had to thank the pilot
On to the baggage claim
To find the airline lost my luggage
Forgot to put a nametag, had to turn thuggish
They claim it might have mistakenly got shipped off to London
Actually, that's my next stop on tour
I wondered if I could just pick it up there
Swear, if I can't reclaim it
A brother might lose his mind
Havin' nothing to wear was the last thing I would have expected
Stewardess lookin' at me like
Calm down, Mr. Brown
Don't be so overly affected
Cause if we lost it, we'll find it
Please give me your tour manager contact
And stay open minded
Look, it's not about the clothes
I got valuables in it
The things that my kids gave me for luck
That's why I feel offended
You tellin' me to remain calm
You got your belongings
I'm out of luck, as far as I'm concerned
We ain't on the same page
Until you find and deliver my luggage
And that's reality
Excuse me if I don't seem open to your hospitality
Just get my shit
No more words need to be exchanged
I'll use discretion next time
And book in a more reputable plane

[Hook]
