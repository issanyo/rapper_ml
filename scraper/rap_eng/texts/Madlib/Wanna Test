[Madlib]
It be that Tascam villian, not claiming I'm a Sicilian
Gambino at the pavilion, frontin' like I got a million
While y'all niggas coming up to me, "Hey yo, can I get a beat for free?"
That's like the dopeman selling all his stash for no fee
Or a ho working on the ave. for no money
We keep it movin like poverty, my whole zone's on that Lost Art tranquility
Stashin' styles like the lottery the novelty of soul
I'll hit ya in the head, the slang buster
Niggas wanna test, we shine like Almustafa
"Madlib the bad kid", I'm the one to hit ya with the total bliss
Whether extra crisp or mad dirty poppin' hiss
The shit sound better than yours cuz we got the force
While you're going off course, like you're giving up drawers
"The beat conductor", I simply grab the mic and bless
I wonder how many jealous suckers are gonna try and test, so yo

Chorus: Medaphoar
Why ya wanna test like you're keeping it real
While faking for the success and dollar bills
I'm gonna make the cash for the reason I still will
Keep it how I kept it no matter on how you feel
It's like
Why ya wanna test like you're keeping it real
While faking for the success and dollar bills
I'm gonna make the cash for the reason I still will
Keep it how I kept it no matter on how you feel

[Madlib]
I'll take it back like Just-Ice
And keep my flow on the basics so I'll hit precise
Kinda like we device on the 1200, DJ Romes give a slice
While ya rhymes sound like Fisher Price
Heist, I run a shiesty pon mice
When the design hit nice
I'll bet none of your lines can suffice
In my realm of darkness, use you as a sacrifice
The only thing that you can take from me is advice
Stepping over here to battle me, I'll strictly entice
Like my nigga bag the dice watching your crew splice

Chorus

*scratches till fade*
