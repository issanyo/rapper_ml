[Verse I]
Go figure, figures and figures, and I'm back at it
Stack cabbage til I'm red in the face, like a radish
Imagine my life, that lavish
Black planet nigga, cash king, jack rabbits, snatch carrots
Bagging the green, flights to Paris
With a young Janet Jack on my team
No comparing, less I'm paired on the cover with Darlene (ortiz)
Pardon, but I ordered a chai tea not an ice tea
Patience is pricey, time is money, bitch, buy nice things
I might bling on 'em, if the right scene summons 'em
Mic fiends wondering, if ima bring bundles of that white queen
'Cause I way I make the night gleam
Boy must be pushing the snow, the glow so clean
Gold fourteen and my daughter 5 months
Hey, time to celebrate, rolled five blunts
Livest ones only want riches
Go figure, figures and figures, and I'm back at it

Go figures, figures and figures, and I'm back at it

[Verse II]
She said, "Why you always act like you that mackin'?"
'Cause I'm in a black palace, bitch, stack napkins
Got it made like I got a maid
Got paid then I got laid, fill up my lemonade
Don't forget, my shit bang like nigga's gangs
Niggas came and claimed, and ain't shit changed
'Cept the numbers on the pay check, bitties on my latex
And all them big bodies they ain't made yet
I may get her begets, pair of gazelles or Chanel
Been her well, like Louise does films
I been a beast since, Della Reese was filmed
I felt compelled to mention her, she was beasting 'em
Chuck tees, khakis with the crease in 'em
White tees, out the cleaners with 'em
Is it spank?
Got damn, bitches in the bank
Go figure, figures and figures
And I'm back at it
