And Anthony was into this other music
And it just really spoke to me
And I started hearing musicians like Bud Powell and uh
Charlie Parker, and Dizzy Gillespie, and Miles Davis
And boy that was, that was it
And uh, and I would recommend
That if somebody's really serious about music, to study
But I was hungrier and hungrier to get into some new sounds
And uh, the first electronic instrument, keyboard instrument I ran across
Got a lot of electronic pianos around
The one I particularly like is the Fender Roads electric piano

Then there's the electric clavinet
It's really like an electric clavicord
And it has strings
And it has little rubber hammers that hit the string when you press the key down
Like this

I think that's sort of the most guitar like
The clavinet sound, when it has that wah-wah thing going
Then there's other kinds of things you can do
To a signal source to alter the sounds
Then I got into the wah-wah peddles
Here's how the wah-wah sounds on the clavinet
The last keyboard instrument that I got into
Is not truly a keyboard instrument
Its a small synthesizer
There's a whole universe of sounds with this
And this is not representative
Its just one of a trillion sounds you could get

And off from ground zero
With no preconceived ideas of what we're going to play
Either rhythmically, or melodically, or harmonically
We don't know what's going to emerge from moment to moment
And there's no real leader of this kind of music
The focus shifts
Sometimes the music is coming right from the center of the room
Somehow through us, and we're just the vehicles for it
It can go any direction

Where we begin from somepoint
And emerge out of that explosion
Into some kind of walking jazz time
That's something that we like to do
Ok?
