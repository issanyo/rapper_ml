[Intro]
There's a book, I once read
And in a chapter it was said...

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty having me
Daily told the people
"You can call me Your Majesty!"
Keep your battery charged
You know it won't stick, yo
And it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick 'ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter
Peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow
Don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa
Whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try
Villain: the worst guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out of square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly, like look at you
It's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name

"It's over now, leave the game"

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off!
The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'
The pot doubles
Now they really got troubles
Madman never go *pop!*
Like snot bubbles

[Outro: MF DOOM]
Yes, no?
Villain, Metal face to Destro
Guess so, still incredible how cess grow
Just say Ho! I'll test the yayo
Wild West style fest, y'all best to lay low
Hey bro, Day Glo
Set the bet, pay dough
Before the cheddar get away, better get
Maaco
The worst hated God who perpetrated odd favors
Demonstrated in the perforated Rod Lavers
...
Quad flavors
Still back in the game like Jack Lalanne
