[Verse I]
Yeah, it’s like, who got it jumping?
If you said Nitty or Lib, you sayin’ something
And it’s nonstop like the tick goes tock
Drop shit like pigeon drops flying from the rooftop
Who’s hot, who drops shit like this?
Even ghetto bird booties be like, “That’s my shit”
Frank Nitt, Madlib, uh, no they didn’t
Connect the midsection and the west then it’s hitting
The underground hidden in the sunshine
One rhyme, one beat, nothing like them niggas ‘cause they dumb sweep
We just let it beat in the jeep with the buddha
Beats by Dre on your laptop computer
I’m the future like Guilty said
“Them chickens give me filthy head ‘cause now they know my name”

[Chorus]
And I hope y’all ready ‘cause we about to go on, on, on
I want to see them hands up high
Like you’re looking for your dreams
So reach for the sky, we go on, on, on
And I hope y’all ready ‘cause we about to go on, on, on
Let me see them hands up
All my real live people stand up
We ‘bout to go on, on, on

[Verse II]
I’m electric, that’s my plan
I’m an honorary member of the jutang clan
We that new thang, man, like Usain Bolt
Go buy your own fire like we in a speed boat
Might choke on the flame smoke, blunt rolled proper and
When we runout, we see the weed doctor and
The beats bang proper and I’m something like a pimp
Roll up, get money then I’m out this bitch, then go on
At the speed of sound, at this high speed with ease I move around
All across the bubble, Frisco to Spain
And when we go there, all the girlies know our names
And no it’s not a game, it’s real life pimpin’
And pimpin’, if you’re slippin’ on your pimpin’ then you trippin’
And we go on

[Chorus]
And I hope y’all ready ‘cause we about to go on, on, on
I want to see them hands up high
Like you’re looking for your dreams
So reach for the sky, we go on, on, on
And I hope y’all ready ‘cause we about to go on, on, on
Let me see them hands up
All my real live people stand up
We ‘bout to go on, on, on
