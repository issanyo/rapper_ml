I'm perplexed But i do  not flex
Skinny nigga with a chicken chest
Wear a Bullet proof cause it's proof that i have Ammunition i'm on a mission to be the best I used to be the biggest hypochondriac I'm an Insomniac with a brown pack as I kick back jamming to flowers I regret  everyday I smoked the power eating some cauliflower watching power

Blomming like my First name Moderate my dream is to have babies at a first rate detonating every structure tryna extricate depreciate like cars ejaculate initate all the failed attacks at my head I've got this Game hanging by a thread feather bed fucking clutching my gun confusing everydody used to a nobody a missfit tryna fit in complex rhymes and dimes that you probrably won't get a head

The bread is everybody's goal everybody is trying to sell their soul with no parole population control I go through the border control I hope everybody will listen to this song and loose control reflecting erecting expecting a new spawn mami put on that thong and take me out of this world like the mastodon that's heavy like the band

I use to tie I used to tie I used to think about the time I die unsatisfied mystified thoughts in my head trying to quantify equal balance that will leaves you mortified calculating my greatness alternating what is right but I keep going left blessed I'm not stressed I used to stare at the constellations croatian bitch she'll get her pussy wet like a fucking  crustacean
Chrous
Lately I've been hearing the reaper Im calling I'm falling x6
Lord take my soul the soul of my heart speaks x1
I hold my face and start
Levitating x1
