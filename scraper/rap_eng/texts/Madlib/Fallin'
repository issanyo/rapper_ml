[Intro]

[Verse: Asce Blayze]
Flippin' verses like I'm door to door selling bibles they get the boot I get invited in right on arrival
It's brute force when it go to doors that I'm kicking but I'm stealthy I'm like level 100 lock picking
When the light dying know the resident is evil, Everybody like a zombie feed on brains of the people
Seem like most want Zeni what would you do for a penny what about acceptance I just want y'all to respect this
That's why I stick with content I went through my years of nonsense so I'm never bouncing back unless I put that on the track
Just a hurdle that i'm bouncing over spitting like a Squirtle you're a hare so you know exactly how it's over
Offending all these brothers at once like black face fighting for the same crown homie it's a rat race
That's why I keep my halo on me flow on a different plane than them it's alien man I'm an undercover covenant
I love anonymity hope you sleepin on a bed of clouds but I'm causing thunder I'm enlightened when it come to sound
Asteroid to the planet coming down got a killer style something like the moon it ain't ya day when I come around
Dig into your skull kid tryna get get up in yo mind genius wit the wisdom give em knowledge wit a little rhyme
Dr no Seuss, keep it surgical wit the moves but no scrubs get down to business what's an ace without a suit
