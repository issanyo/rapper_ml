[Verse 1]

It gets real ya’ll, gets pretty real ya’ll
Piece by piece, it’s hard to eat with no peace
Gotta work it for the meal, fuck dreaming ‘bout the mill
You gotta grab it like it there
Ain’t no give and go, no ally boutta give you throne
Mercy is out yo
From murders to my brother back when black ain’t in style though
Rap like I gotta gat packed inside my windpipe
Your girl, she my pipe hoe
I cut that bitch off like a typo
Claim me that killer kicking cats when they kittens
Claim me that crown, I stop crawling when breathing
Crossed the bridge while ya busy solving the riddle
I’ma be the main main, ain’t no Drew in the Middle
Most ya hating, saying we ain’t boutta steal your fairytale
Make the bitch very real
Want the whips, chains man
New slave, new slave
We been saw the Batman but realize the Bruce Wayne
Looking at you sideways, give a fuck what you say
It’s my day, mayday
This your last reign day
Excuse me, who’s he
Hit ‘em with the uzi
I’ma run ‘em out till all they can do is sue me, excuse me?

[Chorus]

(‘Fore I go mad me take control, trip
Now you know, step me dare that you trip)
Here we go now, here we go now
Can’t stop now, you gotta
Cop the flow, can’t keep it slow cause it
Get for real gotta catch the feel
Get for real, gotta get for real
Get for real
Here we go now, here we go now
[Verse 2]

It’s gets real ya’ll, gets pretty real ya’ll
Once you realize you the one behind the wheel
I been sleeping on wheel
Thank the Lord ain’t crash the whip
But I’ll come back from the dead on some Through the Wire feel, shit
Your homie acting funny like he reading scripts
Why I keep it dolo, prove myself I’m worth the Grammy chip
People keep the shade, they ain’t tryna see your shine in it
You be wearing diamonds, while all I need is my face and my features
My bank account would be big to be featured
I’m staring at you like that’s why you been reaching
Tippy toe and grab the bar and throw it right where it’s needed
My flow too deep it’s swimming right above demons
My competition is the man I’ll be
My B game is an A on your sheet
Ya knockoffs, I’ma stay on my feet
I told myself nowadays like man there ain’t no slipping
No slipping
Fuck the bullshit man, no tripping
Man no tripping, mind your business
Who watching, bitch who watching
Take knowledge, take knowledge
‘Fore I go mad with it

[Chorus]

( ‘Fore I go mad me take control, trip
Now you know, step me dare that you trip
Watch me go here, here we go now
Here we go, here we go
Watch my gold crown
Watch my black, black be gold in the now
Watch my black, black be gold in the now)
Here we go now
Can’t stop now, you gotta
Cop the flow, can’t keep it slow cause it
Get for real gotta catch the feel
Here we go x4
