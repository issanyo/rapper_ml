[Verse 1]:

Hard for me poke her, god forbid, I offer man I'm far from mediocre
I was eating like a needy greedy ogre
Now my heart is bleeding and I'm sitting eating yogurt
Almost lost completely, see me on a milk cart
I can't trust my sweetie, I'm defeated now the Hulk hurt
Little giant lying in a puddle not to soak her
But little giant getting muddy I'm the joker
Study my report card, buddy i got four stars
Everybody huddle while I'm bloodier then war scars

Ey

Underneath the north star, war horse
Hoping that a porsche will be my fourth car
Sippin' from a gold tea cup, girl B cup
Wanna be a C cup, telling her to speak up
Walk through night club, people still clearing space
Keep doing shows, soon I'm gonna need a hearing aid
As an old man i'll be Conan on a stone throne
Pointing up to space saying phone home
I'm arnold scwharzenegger with a chrome dome
I'm a terminator, Imma burn em with these gold poems

Ya

Smoke you with this home grown
Livin' in a glass house, careful of the stones thrown
Roaming like a cellphone ya I'm in my own zone
Killin all these drone clones
