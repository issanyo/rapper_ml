[Intro]

[Hook:]
I want what I want, I’m never happy
It’s my life and I do what I wanna do
You could say what you want, it ain’t changin’ me, me, me, me
I want what I want, I’m never happy
It’s my life and I do what I wanna do
You could say what you want, it ain’t changin’ me, me, me, me

[Verse 1: TiRon]
Man I want a Lexus to impress the opposite sex
And get the exes mad they ain’t with a nigga
I wanna get a better crib and yeah, I should be happy
That I got this one but this one ain’t that one
And that one got a swimming pool, more rooms than I need
But shit, you see the view?
Bigger backyard, garage with two cars in it
Mine got an Astro van that stay dented and yeah
I know it took a minute to get it and
Mama helped out with it by givin’ us the cheddar
But, but, I want a beamer, wait no, I wanna be the nigga
With a better beamer, yup, that’s me, but am I happy?
Nope, never...

[Hook:]
I want what I want, I’m never happy
It’s my life and I do what I wanna do
You could say what you want, it ain’t changin’ me, me, me, me
I want what I want, I’m never happy
It’s my life and I do what I wanna do
You could say what you want, it ain’t changin’ me, me, me, me

[Verse 2: TiRon]
Man I want a Bentley, plus a crib with a high ceilin’
To get all of these women feelin’ bad they ain’t with a brotha
I wanna get another whip but nah, I gotta spend money clearin’ up credit
And Sallie Mae ain’t makin’ that an option, I know I should watch it
Cause I’ve been blessed to go to college when other folks
The same color as me couldn’t get a job
Cause they never graduated so they stay up on the block
And yeah, I know I’m not in a bad position
Cause I got a pot to piss in and a roof over my head
But, but, I want fame, wait no, I wanna be the nigga
With a bigger name, and that’s me, but am I happy?
Nope, never...

[Hook:]
I want what I want, I’m never happy
It’s my life and I do what I wanna do
You could say what you want, it ain’t changin’ me, me, me, me
I want what I want, I’m never happy
It’s my life and I do what I wanna do
You could say what you want, it ain’t changin’ me, me, me, me
