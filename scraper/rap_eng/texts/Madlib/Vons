In the fucking vons building bonds with my new friends following the trends and for safety have a condom on
Never have a fear of the future. Never let a guy touch your girl or you’ll lose her
It ain’t no fucking game when he screws her. Buy a 9 milli play silly and amuse her
Rack 40z's off the freezer. Blast the cashier disappear in a breather

Shaker. Pulling chronic outta pockets, I promise. Nothing bad reeking in the chocolate
Faker. Selling lows for high profits. Speaking to my prophets to prevent the full coffins
Taker. Stealing markers like a novice. RSK on the fucking walls and on the faucets
Breaker. Find a snitch who ends the project. Kick him in his nuts so he can feel that he’s object

Masturbate to your own classmates and ask the judge whats big deal about ass rape
Friendships shatter like glass breaks and if you wanna be fed lies just ask Nate
Your girl wanna hang you can't fight it. Try to put it in without a rubber, it’s a tight fit
Ass cake owned and you liked it. Brag to all your friends show the pics and then wipe it
Depression plaguing all your rap night shit. Writers block keep your ass coming back to my shit
Hype up the album like you typed it. Yet if someone asks you to rap you can’t recite it

Going back to watch the old blues clues breaking news pass your ill mind eat your baby food
Momma screaming at you when the Lakers lose and daddy yelling at you when your fapping hand hit snooze
Rip back to real life? I refuse. Drinking all the booze til you’re dizzy getting arms bruised
Driving like you going on a night cruise. One mistake end you permanently like a tattoo
