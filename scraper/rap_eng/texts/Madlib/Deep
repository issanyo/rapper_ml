[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Alright now
Baby times is hard so I'mma change my hustle to hard white now
And couple of my customers chose with they nose
That I suppose they wanna light up with the pipe now
Sellin straight dope out the ride
Speedin past the police wouldnâ€™t advise
Got a hard pack, of that Star Trek
To make a bitch beam up to the enterprise
And you a Captain Kirk, trading ass for work
Let a bitch sniff your pack, you got burnt
Still owe me $2300 for that twerk
Finna post up at your place so don't worry
Nigga don't snitch, don't tell
Rap niggas they recite that so well
Be the same mothafucka that done ratted out his homie
He ain't even have enough no money for his own bail

[Interlude]
Let's go
(Deep inside the ghetto)
Where I be

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Fuck with a nigga
Yellin' I be fucking with them fellas
If you buying or selling you can find me
In the hood with hot goods, we got those
Nigga I just stole these rims, watch the potholes
All laws and street codes, y'all forgot those
Homie I done been on the block since a snot-nose

[Interlude]
(Deep inside the ghetto)
Where I go

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
East Side, 17th Ave
Better keep a G-pass on ya G.I. to Chicago
Where the real niggas dead or locked up
Teenage pretty friends get knocked up
The young niggas out here tryna get guaped up
They ain't got no other choice they washed up
Living on the edge of addiction, STD's, and enslavement
Black blood tend to flood the street pavement
White man set the price and we pay it
All a nigga want is whips and chains
Probably cause a nigga wasn't whipped and chained
To the bottom of a boat in the middle of the ocean
Stripped of my own motherfucking name
Stripped of my whole motherfucking culture
Sold by my own to the snakes and vultures
Reality is sad, but it's true
So what can a nigga do when your own people don't support you
Fuck ass cop tryna pull me over
Trunk full of dope but I'd rather get smoked than live, shit

(How brave of this pig ass nigga man)

[Outro]
I'mma take ya
To a place where a muhfucka gotta be a thug by nature
Where it's really all about that paper
Nigga try to jump, always think you're

(Deep inside the ghetto)
Where I be

Fuck with a nigga
Yellin' I be fucking with them fellas
If you buying or selling you can find me

(Deep inside the ghetto)
Where I go

G.I. to Chicago
