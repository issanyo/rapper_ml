[ Poem: Genesis the Greykid ]

There are things unseen,
That i've seen asleep,
The sound of snow the humble feet,
Of spiders crawling a-top a peach,
Smaller than the grands of sand,
That cloth the land...along va beach,
You know what I mean...?

[ Verse 1: Genesis the Greykid ]

(do y'all know...what I mean?)
(do y'all know...what I mean? huh, huh)
This old man ask me,
"what sits in the water, but doesn't touch the water?"
I said "i dont know?"
He said reflections, now the lesson,
Is to try and understand when people gaze in your direction,
The confessions by the tongue are over powered by perception,
See, no one will ever believe a thing when you talking dreams,
Until you live in/(living) them like Inception,
Came from the dirt,
So the ground is my complexion, follow the message,
And leave the jag like Leftwich,
I asked him "what you mean?"
He said, "dreams and material things can be ya death wish"
...death wish

[ break/chrous ]

Made me ask that question...
"do y'all know (ahhhh I can't sing), what I mean?"
But y'all get it.
Huh,

[ Verse 2: Genesis the Greykid ]

See I done seen times harder than you think,
Nothing here to drink,
Had to fill the milk carton with the water from the sink,
No money in the bank...
Man I went a year where I couldn't put more than three dollars in the tank,
(laugh)...really humbled my attitude,
I stayed grounded verifying my altitude,
Even though I could brag about what ima do,
I was raised that its way better when it comes from you,

A lot of rappers all the same now,
Strip club hundred dollars from a rain cloud,
Since im trying to bring change to the game now -
They'll probably wanna take aim and try to shoot my plane down,
(laugh) that might be why I gotta fear of flyin',
Man of faith but I still gotta fear of dyin',
I believe in the most high,
Throwing prayers to the sky,
But I still got a feel for science...
(feel for science).

Y'all know what I mean...you know what I mean?
Huh,
Huh,
