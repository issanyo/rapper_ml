Hate my life but handle with patience
Yall act hood on family vacation
I'm from the lower class you are a spoiled brat
Smile in your face than stab your back I am full of crap
A stranger to my best friend you think a man know me
I use to stay around the ice like a zamboni
That means I hustled jib and lost a lot for it
Got locked up and had knives to my esophagus
Never birded off one of my accomplices
I'm proud of that don't have to many accomplishments
We use to make chops on the next man block
I'm stagnant now and work a dead end job
Tried to fit in with peers but nothing panned out
The writings all over the wall like a hand style
I'm either above these mother fucking  crumbs or just feeling myself cause I'm coming from the slums
I'm sicker than sticking dick  and the balls  to a syphilis broad than twisting her up like she's piff in a jar
Fuck that I've getting side tracked this ain't the time for a drill were not in chiraq
If the pistols on your waste you running with rookies
This is Canada we keep our guns in the bushes
And if I pull it I know exactly where I'll put it
Secret places on reservations where I can hide the bullets
Or we can fisticuffs I'll just drop dudes
So prepare to touch the ground like top rock moves
This is my gospel what I writes proper lines so dope you think they going up the nostril
Want me to kill myself? you better do it for me
I fathered your style we can get the news from Maury
It don't matter if you thinking that it real I'm in your girls box like a letter in the mail
I got medicine for sale a little heaven to inhale and its called Tim Sellin known for pedaling the real
Still I don't have any prejudice when you speak to me
Yall pieces of shit  I hate equally
Whether your white black yellow or brown get stabbed severed then found no mans hearing a sound
Your life's a bigger waste than hand roll hash
Man the reaper on your back the SAMCRO patch
I'll rock cross colors and a kangol hat before you catch me in the club trying to hang or dance
It's like maw fuckers  is sleeping go ahead and grab a blanket
You only banging cause you hanging with a gang of faggots 
I've got a roll of quarters under my knuckles before I punch I'll say something like homie I'm a be putting my money where your mouth is
Than say the same thing to the hooker that im counseling
