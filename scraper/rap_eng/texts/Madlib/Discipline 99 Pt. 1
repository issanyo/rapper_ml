[Verse 1: Quasimoto]
It's Lord Quas with the pack up on it
Got a crew up in the bay that's always dropping components
When you're stuck in highway one
We jump the gun and try to get the Mass Appeal

[Verse 2: Wildchild]
(Ha-ha)
LP's
That's the MC to raise the roof
Its not a promo
So wheres the photo
Of Quasimoto
Hes looking in the back ready to attack wack MCs with peanut butter.. wolf
Who drops the beats that make you stutter
I jump up on the spot like Dominique Wilkins when he be hot, come at you unexpected like Gary Coleman
The scary sole man
Where freestyle flows every now and
Don't even own blunts but I be clouding

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Quasimoto]
I got the lyrical stamina
Always programming a
New type of Antidote
In your perimeter
While you niggas just limit the
Styles you could be doing
Lord Quas keep the crowd from booing
Always stay true'n
Everything I kick stick eternal
Leaving them crisp like an inferno
Y'all niggas ain't learn though
New songs to pound
Its like I'm J-Bees
Relaxing on the scene
Plus I'm taxing smoking green
Quasimoto
We drop the natural ingredients
All over you greedy pimps
Playa' haters
Niggas acting wild on the mic need obedience
Y'all niggas running through
Like y'all nuts off to screw
I feed y'all niggas to the gators
(And watch y'all gonna go?)
Its funny how y'all front like you niggas got money
But at the end of the day you stuck looking like dummies
While I hit ya' with Discipline 99

[Hook]
