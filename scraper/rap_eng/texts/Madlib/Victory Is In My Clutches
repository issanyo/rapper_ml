[Intro: unknown sample]
You open up this door before I tear up this place
(Knocking)

[Hook: Tone Treasure]
I want to thank you
For being so blind (so blind)
You didn't know (didn't know)
That it was my time
They should have told you
I am for the people
And on my shoulders
Carrying the world
Say it sir victory is mine oh yeah

[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
I tumble like the dice do
Stay on the humble like Christ do
Piss stanzas and shite haikus
Since I was a young tyke who
Tried to moonwalk like Michael
I understood the Universe's cycles
Positive negative neutral
Impoverished kids on sedatives'll never live mutual
Where reverends, presidents, movie stars, cinema-togra-phers
And producers, so standardized education in its current state
Is useful, I'm mean useless
Pardon the slippage
The dead'll probably target the jargon as gibberish
Meanwhile I'm off in the stars warring with Iblis
You see them atoms spinning
You see them waves shimmerin'
You see them Wisdoms grinning
The masculine energy make them feel feminine
I transformed, they start assembling
From Moab to Menden
Sitting bull is twisting sitting ducks like dutches
Victory is in my clutches
Motherfuckers

[Tone Treasure]
Victory is mine, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
You can't touch this like Hamm and them
I'm on auto pilot, sipping Pinot Noir, eating sal-a-mon
Brother with Falon, and the son of Marilyn
Chancellor of hope
Sharp like razor, clean like soap
The simplest metaphors be the dope
They stumbling out of focus
I spit that hocus pocus
Man these niggas absolutely bogus
Your cockroach flow is hopeless
I'm on they ass like locusts

[Tone Treasure]
Victory is mine, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
In and out the studio
The flow is unruly so
My attack level is way higher than Yu-Gi-Ohs
My defence level is in the trillions
So if you want to duel
Your rocket better be filled up with fuel
Cause when you get here, I'll be on the stool, cracking booze
And you'll be tired from the journey
So how you think that you could ever burn me
Man these wack niggas don't concern me
Bring out the gurneys and summon my attorneys

[Hook: Tone Treasure]

[OUTRO: Muhammad Ali]
Well my resolutions are to become the youngest Heavyweight Champion in history, that's nothing new to my fans, they all know that I will be the next Heavyweight Champion
