As our eyes meet,parallel
You have a nigga thoughts spinnin' like a carousel
And plus the fact that you're attractive that's a blessing
With your lovely figure captivating gazes with your methods
Your sex appeal is separate
Peanut butter skin posing graceful with your necklace
The fisherman is casting out their bait in your direction
I just fall back with my intentions of progression
With perfect timing showing that i'm different from the rest
And, visions of you got a nigga craving for the record
Hoping you the destination on this journey of affection
The chemistry is tangible i'm feeling the connection
I'm interested but i'm second guessing your acceptance
Yes i am detecting any traces of deception checking for them lethal weapons
No sign detected, i agreed to her acceptance
So i proceed to focus on the steez of my impression
I kept it smooth trying not to go beyond my measures
But i kept it real and told her that i'm in it for the pleasure
It's all good cause you swerved in the right lane
With Loui_D, a pioneer with his pipe game
If you could settle the score with the right change
It will be a ninety nine percent chance of slight rain
Or splash waterfalls, down to your ankles
Hit the sweet spot like vanilla cones with the sprinkles
Scoop of Ben and Jerry's hitting it from missionary
I don't know who invented sex, but i'm a visionary
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye but not between the sheets
And blasting off to take her to the highest height that she can reach
And this goes out to all the females that be teasing
And the ones that need it like a pacifier when a baby's teething
I'll power stroke you to the best gettin' booty song
And have you saying "thanks for introducing me to LouiLong"
