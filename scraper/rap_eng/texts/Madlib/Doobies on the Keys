[Intro]
Showtime
Smudges on the whites
Ashes on the blacks
Hammers hitting strings
Pedal pressing
Just enjoy the sound
And the atmosphere
Cloudy visuals
Just progressing

[Hook]
Heads are nodding
We are rocking
All inhaling
Clouds of notes
Just keep listening
While it's burning
On top of the piano
Float along
Exhale the less
Realize that your blessings
Are on the grand
Please swipe the doobies off the keys

[Verse]
Jetting on the staff
Play the wonders light
A fog fills the air
Streaking shrills of static
And pitch
With tones deeply
Rolled within
The saga begins
Bring a pack or two
Or sheet music will do
Long as the descant is slow
We can burn fo sho

[Break]
Descending on the line
Diminishing the tune
Crescendos from my fingertips
Fill the air now
Go deep within my lungs
And travel to my soul
I'm flying close to the melody
I hear now

[Hook 2]
Lighters flicking people talking
Silhouettes all made of smoke
Reigniting chants and chiming
All around the clavicle
Ebony and ivory
With little tiny green
Spots on the grand
Please wipe off the doobies on the keys
