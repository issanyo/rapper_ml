[Verse 1]
Let's do a little catching up
Cause we ain't talked years
Sometimes I told myself I was good without you
Other times I sat in my bedroom and shed tears
Just from thinking about you
I swear it's hard not to think about you
My quote on quote father figures never showed me the ropes
Where was you at?
When I needed hope
No hard feelings
Cause I learned to cope
Nobody's Perfects
Its a lesson in every mistake
So everything was worth it

[Hook]
Aye
How you been I ain't heard from you in a while
Just checking on you
Just to see how you living now
Man its crazy how time flies
I could never say good-bye
It's defiantly been a long time, x2

[Verse 2]
All we ever talked about
Was rapping and sneakers
A lot stuff woke up
But at the time we was only dreamers
So we grew together
No matter what we go through together
We keep fighting
Until we see a break through together
My nigga
I love you like you was the other son from my mother
Yeah you like my blood brother
Aye babygirl
How you been
We don't even conversate no more
You say you miss me
I ain't even got fate no more
You bit the hand
That gave you food for thought
Now you ain't even got a plate no more
Love
It ain't no more
Look at me now
I'm like painting pictures like a young Picasso
I got the hunger for success
For you its hard to swallow
But on the real
How you been doe?

[Hook]
