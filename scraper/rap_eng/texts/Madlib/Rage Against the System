[Verse 1: Big Diesel]
Creating a system in which they cannot control
A progeny of sex, money, drugs, oh yeah, rock and roll
Listening ever since I was a snotty nose
Begin pursuing when fluids started leaking from my hose
I apologize for that deviating metaphor
That would leave you confused like you are doing Tom’s chores
Haters tend not to understand anything in my perspective
So they try to shield their ears away as a contraceptive
They want to typecast the youth in attempts of classifying
But this is a new era and your attempts are asinine
This is the kind of music that’s not for the narrow minded
Because I remembered the days when I was once misguided
But, today I flip lyrics like I flip pancakes
And later eating MCs for dessert like they some cupcakes
For those who claim host of the show, well I am the invader
And you the boy who shouted fire in a crowded theater
Music needs a revival, not claiming that I’m their savior
But as a prophet to lead them away from false creators
Empire mindset coming from the land of the pelican
Leaving no trace of anything that Caine can find evident
But it is evident that the absence of evidence
Is not the evidence of absence is just another avoidance
To generally accept facts to appeal to the ignorance
Shifting the burden of truth away from the innocence
That is ignorant that it lies within their consciousness
Accepting a standing ovation for false accomplishments
Creates delusion to those falling prey to the system
If we continue to overlook, then we are forever victims
I just want to be free not living in nobody’s shadow
Or standing in front of the man in black with his wooden gavel
But it’s all up to you create a name or a nameplate
Creating a system like establishing a cognate
