[Verse](Madlib)
Everybody wants to carry around gats
To get stacks around the way with the mislead facts
But most niggas dont even know where they at
Added self with no knowledge but street smarts
On the west rock the zest to put any heads to rest
Not even criminal, I bet you wouldn't
Even pull half the time talkin bout you can rhyme
You better get that yayo out of your mind
And you'll find that one day theres only one way
For you to go out one route to take you out
You walk around the line like you're in a cowboy flick
Acting like you gonna stick when you really ignorant
