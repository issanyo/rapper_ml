I breathe, spit, shit, and hiccup flames
You might catch me flicking bricks at a pick up game
Need a dime to gimme dome, I'm tryna pick up dames
Like the trailblazers, and I'm a call em later
But they way up the ladder, see my minds on other matters
Let em hate, I love the chatter, stats don't measure stature
See I don't trust the data


And to think there was a time when I began to doubt this shit
On the outside looking in, they had me camping out this bitch
Like "Get Brandon out, he can't amount, he's tantamount to shit"
I knew I deserved the fandom, like I ain't about to quit
I'll go ham in every stanza til they chant and shout the shit
Man my fans about to flip..
