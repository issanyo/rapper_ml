[Verse 1: Quasimoto]
Look, I know you didn't cut that whole thing
It happened last month anyway
I had my eyes on you (here's the deal)
You just been walking about a week or two
What put you on the block anyway?
A kid, an old man, the drugs, probably all three
(Here's the deal) Wouldn't be no news to me
Cause ain't nothin under a rock that I ain't seen
I'm just a guy collecting my money, smokin green
Nothing's gonna happen to you, at least nothing new
(Cry and you cry alone) It's cool, I'm black too!
(Smile! (?)) If you know what's good for you (shh)
You make enough cheese you could be my main boo
Smile (if you know what's good for you)

[Interlude]

I'm takin care of business, like they say
Green is business, they say oh boss screamin the funny way
Comes all the way in a circle is what I mean
It all starts and finishes with green (right?)

[Verse 2: Madlib]
Green ain't only money you know
It's silence, country, and things that grow
You could have your foot in a drift or watch it be
That's where it's at, in a funny way, if you follow me
(Then) maybe I'll work on my ratio some
('Till judgement comes)
(Just tell them everything)
(Green) is a lick no matter where you place it
(Green) is the color today, always been, face it
The (green) on my scene change everyday
(Let us do unto you they say)
Green is a life bag in a different way
But it could lead to a death bag too (neon red anyway)
It could lead to a death bag too (neon red anyway)
