[Verse 1: Napoleon Da Legend]
I touch a generation what I generated got em jaded
I dropped a tape all this garbage no longer tolerated
You dropped your pants to get famous I’m anticipated
I got a plan and plus I cannot be manipulated
I’m from the jungle half of you bums is domesticated
My sound is rugged but I like my chicks sophisticated
Fuck with me I’m KGB get physically eliminated
Its rather particular the way that I articulate it
Your raps is gibberish I rep for the indigenous
You getting cash I’m getting stocks that give up dividends
That’s the fundamental difference
Not to mention the legend’s not sentimental kid I’m not conscientious
Bomb your henchmen catch me on the big shit
Lama’s spit bullets to racist folks acting condescending
Get smacked like Trump supporters at a Farrakhan speech
The pharaoh lives long like the legacy of Sean P listen

[Chorus x2: Sean P]
I’m in a whole different space call it Andromeda
Battlestar Galactic with the ratchet I will lama ya

[Verse 2: Napoleon Da Legend]
Proper Kundalini opposite of Mussolini
Picture two centerfolds poolside in blue bikinis
Who can see me send a missile through your beanie
Whodini if you don’t like it delete me
In a tipi with a native you might see me on a playlist
Might be cheating on your wife she might be cheating with your neighbor
They watching every step thinking you smarter than the rest
Ready to stab you in the back like Monica Seles
People love success but they hate successful people
So I let my music do the damage that’s the lesser evil
The devil’s in the details reach levels unheard
So when you hear a bar from PO put respect on his word
