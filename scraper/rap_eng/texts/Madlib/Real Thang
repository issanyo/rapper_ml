I know a lot of people been telling you this and that
Oh, but don’t you listen, ‘cause they don’t know where it’s at
They don’t know where it’s at…fall back
Think you better tell your soldiers...fall back
Ladies! Ladies and gentlemen, come on

[Hook]
I do my real thang, real thang, real thang
Real thang, real thang, treal thang

[Verse 1]
You don’t, a-don’t, a-don’t know me
So don’t discuss with your homies
Poker face for you phonies
Start the show, man
I’m ‘bout to summons my soldiers
Can’t wait to, wait to take over
Kick the door down
Gon’ rush the door now

[Hook]
I do my real thang, real thang, real thang
Real thang, real thang, treal thang (treal)
I do my real thang, real thang, real thang (Oh, oh, oh)
Real thang, real thang, treal thang

[Verse 2]
It’s ‘bout to, ‘bout to get nasty
So nasty, pull out your plasty
Zip it up, go spastic
Zip it up now (Shut up)
I know you thought what you thinkin’
Flip the script, your ship’s sinkin’
Cut you low and I’m shankin’
Clean the floor now

[Hook]
I do my real thang, real thang, real thang
Real thang, real thang, treal thang
I do my real thang, real thang, real thang (Come on, uh)
Real thang, real thang, treal thang

Fall back
Sir, I think you better tell your soldiers that they need to…
Fall back
Hey, oh, ‘cause we coming with a centrifugal force, come on
Fall back
Oh, the force is with you, come on, come on
Fall back
It’s about to get metaphysical
Ladies and gentlemen, reload (Reload!)

[Verse 3]
Through sympathetic vibration (Real)
You ‘bout to feel my sensation (Real)
Pendulum in rotation (Real)
Polarizing, come on (Real)
Toolie parks on my dresser (Real)
Shatter glasses like Ella (Real)
Touch a port and add pressure (Real)
Crystalizing, come on (Real)
‘Bout to balance your chakra (Real)
Raise your octave to opera (Real)
ZAP—electrical shock ya (Real)
Magnetizing, come on (Real)
Ella fists on your temple (Real)
Augmenting your dimple (Real)
Your double helix gon’ triple (Real)
Visualizing, come on

[Hook]
I do my real thang, real thang, real thang
Real thang, real thang, real thang
I do my real thang, real thang, real thang (Yes, come on, uh)
Real thang, real thang, real thang (Oh, fall back)

Real thang, real thang, real thang
Real thang, real thang, treal thang (treal thang)
Real thang, real thang, real thang (Come on, uh, uh)
Real thang, real thang, real thang

Fall back
Real thang…fall back (Ladies and gentlemen, come on)
Real thang…fall back
(Erykah Badu, 1997
Wait a minute, did it get leaked to the radio?)
Fall back (Uh, I think y’all better tell Flex to drop bombs tomorrow
2007 A.D.)

I do my real thang, real thang, real thang

Thank you
