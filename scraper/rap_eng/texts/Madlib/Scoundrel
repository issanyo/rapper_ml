[Verse 1: Abstrakt]
Fancy flows with the nasty prose, I’m going hard
Got these kids pulling back their skin with some glass shards
Apparently, the situation is still prevalent
I’m making dead presidents by killing all the residents
But wait, I gotta get rid of the evidence
Because it’s evident that I’m the culprit of malevolence
It never ends, I was never offered severance
I’m Godless, with no plans of meeting with a reverend
I’m stab him, and dab 'em, like he’s a wax concentrate
I’ll aggravate and irritate, but not stop to contemplate
I’ll leave his body burning at the stake, for the kids’ sake
And toss the burning carcass in the center of a frozen lake
A simple cripple creepin' in the deep end when the people sleepin’
Told me I’m a heathen that ain’t a regular human bein'
Dismissed in the courts due to reason of insanity
No vanity, introverted in my mental cavity
Going against gravity, scientists getting mad at me
I’m awake in the reality, but asleep in the mentality
Killin’ pain, floatin’,  potent as ibuprofen
But not as potent as the sticky green that I be smokin’
My flows are everlasting, fuck the whack rapping
Using cred, smashing heads, your’s is what I’m capping
Your bones going crunch, you can call me your cap’n
‘Cause that shit is how it ends like a burning log cabin
Yo some say it’s breezy, and some say it’s steezy
But I’m just teasing when I say that this shit comes easy
Upperhand, I’m uppercutting people in their faces
Turning them around to see the shockwaves in phases
So basic, these other rappers can’t face it
So take my raps and go off and fucking annotate it
