[Verse: Karriem Riggins]
People made me in the city of the D
They never underestimate the talents from my team
Know the style got’em coming from miles around
Groups of sounding red, everybody with their hands in the air
I’m collecting my paper like a pimp, go get it (Bitch!)
Get money, yeah, pun intended when we got J Rocc
You know Supreme Team’s in your auditorium, yo
In the morn got to pray to the most high, give thanks
We mumbling words, stumble on samples like Peaches and Herb
And, Madlib and Rem-Rig know to pull a shove out
Dig a hole in your local record store coming out
With records by Roy Hayes and Elvin Jones
At night we doing shows, turntables, microphones
We can hit you with that, we bound to get you in the zone
While I’m speaking to my people, I represent my home
In the D, you know your mellow’s never wearing flip-flops
You know my beat knocks, so what you can beatbox
You know they say I’m like the microphone fiend
Who likes to say interesting –
I like to talk about getting cash in astronomical amounts
Journalist try to be subdue, interviews about it
And they ask me about it, Rem
“When did your self-esteem sprout, and when you brainstorm
What you think about?”, and ahe asked
Will Supreme Team move her body?, tsk, uh
It’s ultra-hot, I’m a hip into the hop
Never fumble when we drop the beat – yo
I’m on a mission, and my people gonna understand that we
Study divine secret patience, Riggins, certainly
For the clones, Thanksgiving, I’m like Indian giving back (huh?)
Black sheep like this-n-that, and I like to ride a seven-forty-five
‘Cause that’s my fifo squad, light the green like a light show, yo
Some sneaking trifling like a snake slithers in the gravel at night, an-
(Whatchu say?)
Stab me in the back, jab me with a knife then
You really hating on a classic team just like the Vikings
(Why is that?)
You know the J masamba year is so exciting
(Why do you think that is?)
Wondering if I wrote the words I’m reciting, yeah
Supreme Team make the music all night (Bitch!)
