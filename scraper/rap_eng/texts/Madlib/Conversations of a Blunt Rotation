Maleek:

I'm Never looking at the daily time
Living life working hard just a daily grind
Lone wolf but I'm one of a kind
Flying through sky's so sublime it's truly fine
No bud as prime as mine
Busting niggas up If they stepping outta line
Hold up
I treat a ho like the ho she is
If she smashed the homie then she burning the spliff
It's kinda
Slick
I'm Tryna get rich
Ain't bout a bitch so I fuck and I dip
Just Riding the clouds spacing
I'm moving in fast motion but I know it's all patience
No need to hate cause I'm bringing it to the bank nigga
Stay calm and steady and maybe I'll blow some stank with ya
I got it get it
The women can't deny my pimping
Now I'm in it swim in the pussy then slide out when I'm finished
The one and only ain't fuckin with these gibrronis
Leave a women cold and lonely
Im'a dog Im'a dog
Hopefully I'll be the one to pass it on when I fall
Two phones I turned em off so don't call
Calm like a bomb
My nerves on thin line so I'm picking these niggas off
But I don't mean no harm times two

DeLaNoise:

Don't take it likely, I'm busting these rhymers Gladice Nightly,
Hands off my mic G I'm smacking you stupid only slightly
Come off politely, but in my top im thinking slyly
Dr. Wily to these types, chaos is brought highly
Bring the destruction, like I bring a gloc round the clock
Don't care who flock you speak a lot you getting popped
Better bet, disrespect, classes getting dropped
Rock em on the discrete, like you're was rocking crocs
Slew a crews choose to lose, make em bruise blues
Snooze ya lose dudes, don't get it confused, La rules
Fuck trues, pulling all these bitches wearing trucker shoes,
Royal how I move, Emperor with the Groves
Ugh, now its back to the daily schedule
Bring it back killing tracks stepping up my rapper level
Tears whispering from a devil when I hit em with my bezel
Catching bodies like a Simpson, six niggas maybe several
Phelps with the metals, arsenal of a ninja turtle
Fucking pricks, Ima make his appendix external
Internal dispersal I open up his sternal
Said, Thanks a lot colonel, now back to the herbal circle
