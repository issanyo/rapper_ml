Do y'all believe in god?
Do you actually know what god is?
I know what god is

I was lost
Walking this planet
With no direction

Didn't know my way
It actually would have helped me find my way
They gave me no direction

First searched within my self
I dug deep
I read a few books, I learnt a few things, met a few people

And then I found out about the energies within
My soul, my god, my light

Do you know the way to my home?
I'm lost and i'm all alone

Do you know the way to my home?
See, i'm lost and i'm all alone
Lost and i'm all alone

God shed light on this hell-troubled soul
See, i'm lost and i'm all alone
(All alone)

I have traveled very far
Get my eye on the north star
Lost and i'm all alone

I have no clue on what to do
If I stay this way I know i'm through
All alone (All alone)

Feel the agony of defeat
Walking down the one-way street
All faces i'll pass are sleep

Alone
Lost and i'm all alone
Lost and i'm all alone

(yeah, yeah)

Do you know the way to my home?
See i'm lost and i'm all alone
Lost and i'm all alone

Do you know the way to my home?
I'm lost and i'm all alone
Lost and i'm all alone

Home is where the heart is
Home is where the heart is
All alone

Home is where the heart is
Home is where the heart is
All alone

Do you know the way to my home?
You see, i'm lost and i'm all alone
Lost and i'm all alone
