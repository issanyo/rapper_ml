[Intro]

Check it, check it

I like this beat

[Verse 1: Kevin WA$ABI]

Word to Hov, I'm not average
More like a stallion mixed with a greedy minded nigga to a side chick
Kick it with the best of the group to make the best hits then take a rip of whose bongs got the best hits
I'm about the message
World domination
Then take a trip to my world dominatrix
Yo $iz, I think NL might make it
Then take a trip to see Keanu in the matrix
