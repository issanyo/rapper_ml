[Napoleon Da Legend verse]
Cop this product wholesale my soul ain’t for sale
No need to ride any coattails you know the smell
When Lucifer’s ass pops up in the room
Like a Piru wearing blue, I do not approve
I’m scoring bucket making awkward moves life is hardcore
I just parkour over the obstacles
To the limit pushing anymore would be impossible
It’s obvious, no need to call a whore a prostitute
I got the proper tools to rock a tune opportun'
Hit em with a chopper "Boom" make sure they copping two
This is proper food come feed you too comfy
I hustle like I’m in a third world country
Pimp C, Bun B, the sun on me
Blue chips this shit stupid kid I’m dumb on beats
Carry the burden of my people got a ton on me
When I enter they stare like I got a gun me
Chapter 4, page 6, don’t play around with these chicks
Fuck around you’ll get jacked for all the paper you get
And these well branded bandits in the music scene
Throwing smoke in ya vision and compromise what you believe
This the real talk not that fake woke shit
Well grounded on earth no Frank Ocean

[Napoleon Da Legend verse]
This that real talk not that fake woke shit
Well grounded on earth no Frank Ocean
That Ambrosia for Heads minus the hipster bloggers
Respectful but never been an ass kissing artist
Matter a fact, I’ve been known to go against market
And penetrate despite they efforts to defend the target
Muddy shoes over the red carpet this is Ted Talk bars
Smashing records in the box office
Fuck ya firm, you can get boxed inside ya office
And then get put in a pine box, that’s ya coffin
This is rarity like a moment of clarity
I caught a piece of ya attention momentarily
This what it feels like to be dealing with integrity
Here to unlock a few doors, here’s a set a keys
Barrels of gems, buried in the ground like Medellin
Had to hustle, out on my own before seventeen
Nothing to lean on, other than my vertebrates
I had to come up plan and make it percolate
And there were days where my courage would break
When Too much pride and ya money low a terrible place
Had to scrape, feeling sorry for self, never an option
The best lessons are left behind at the bottom

[Napoleon Da Legend verse]
A plate of escarole in life I play the Escobar role, no stress
Working hard to worry less tomorrow
Fresh barramundi, Fela Kuti In Burgundi Ferrari 2-seat
Bumping Alborosie, my life’s movie...
