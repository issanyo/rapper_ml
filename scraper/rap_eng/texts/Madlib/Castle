Intro :
Been in this pixelated fantasy
Plays weren't better than the quality
All that really mattered was the MC's skills
Oh, that's all that really mattered to me (Oh baby)

Verse 1 :
Never been to First Class
But Exes wonderin' what I'm thinking
Call me Magneto
Flow so deep and chill
Call me Subzero
Godly Zues lightning in a bottle run in terror said the mortals!
Screamed!
Saw no error then the rabbit choked
Cause directors never saw the plot-hole
I'mma decap Rio
Long live Cap Steelo
Zip zap hero
I'm higher than a C-Note!

Verse 2 :
They, can never reach his altitude
Jetlagg, the master of Raz Al Ghul
Born in the pit, shunned away by light
Chose astonishments
Wordplay glows like, Pulp Fiction's briefcase
Gulp Nixon he stayed, wait
I got the wrong notes might as well flow
Don't you be there when the fans line up
When I'm prime-lux with this Kimono
You be sniffin for attention like, Soda
Spittin' Rusty on the mic, ebola
Oceans can't reach high tides slick
Classic movies, I got the cool flick
From the stick shifts
We ballin, I already ate
Eatin' off of bones, shredded my gums cut
Splinters on my teeth, grab my nunchucks
Skatin' on the NY Streets, Cowabunga!

Verse 3:
Huh, take a step back this from my heart
Don't clap when you don't understand art
Take time to realize every word I say
Cause it's called rhymes and poetry for a reason
If you only got half, then this a treason
If you ain't fuckin with the vision
Bitches can square up till roots fall apart
Tired, so I'mma let the shrooms rap this part
They trynna sound nostalgic, like Jurassic Park
Futuristic vision to astound T-rexes like I'm Howard Stark
This the Sistine Chapel, let it take you backwards
So many patterns they terrified just change the channel
Too much for commercials to handle
Stoop down to the king just show manners
I apologize, for too much bable
Welcome to my home and this the Castle!
