[Verse]
Welcome everybody, to this show of a century
You’re host is the enemy of your personal treasury
Now see if it is your pops, your pal or your girl
I curl up on your mattress and testing out my hurl
Now I turned the flow mainstream on this track
But this here still better than being another 2pac
I hoo-haa like Sparta and breach out like the Holy Father trinity
Beyond this, I’ll see that I’m the enemy
Yeah – now let us switch this up
I hit another exit door with forty-niners in my yard
Some call me Bastard, overheard that
And learned that, I’m Marquess
Not Outkast, but still good, like
Buck up, a clusterfuck of livers, wine and fava beans
Aqua so jellybean and took more lives than Mao Zedong
I’m in the wrong, but still Kong, a king like a hit song
Make rites like Semites - see themselves as Christ
A feisty side from a stupid companion of mine
We broke up -  he showed up - a terrorist – bye
They’re not the cleverest men, but still get millions of eyes
A missile might be fizzle for their sizzle and their shite
Balls so light weight, no challenge to provoke
I bait them like a broken fish tank - lake crystal
A brain missing is a brain pissing distal nonsense
So hit me up with another con man
Making me look like I’m part of the KK-Klan
I’m planning these May-days like cabaret in Iran
Hope they don’t spy on my little wordplay
If they wanna kill me, better get a Doomsday
A Rebel with a Boombox
No weed up in my shoebox
It’s hot down here in Tartarus
So call me King Kronos, when I stop this like mad wuss
