[Verse 1: Maleik Dion]
I’m just reaching
Seeing past the reason for believing in death
Even when the minds at rest I’ll be breathing
Inhale the esscene from the ruler of the seasons
Escape the vessel now I’m changing like a leaf in
The autumn breeze
Breathing trees keep my soul at ease
Holding these poems packed with potency
Knowing we got the gold and the gift
Just walk with me watch your souls catch lift
Like the littlest child when he smiles at the loving
I place no one above them while you place them in the oven
That’s disgusting
Why lie you busted
You claim you sprinkling gold you saying nothing
I bring the heat when its cold we call it substance
I spit to speak to the old as well as youngins
A single source of the soul I know its love in
The center of the struggling
But still

[Verse 2: Maleik Dion]
I’m just fiending
Needing new steam in the heathen
For feeding demons
With the burning bush
I got the diamond mind
And the golden look
My kind is hard to find
This knowledge ain’t in books
Cause ignorance a crime
Time spent with the mind set on silent
I’m sent so divine in my eyelids I’m climbing
Back through the eons
Platonic what I be on
Playing with the aeons
You fearful of the séance
I’m saying something different why you spitting slime of Satan
Sharpening the sword suit to slit the wrist of sheitan
Until they stay gone
Just keep on striving till they stay gone

[Verse 3: Maleik Dion]
I got a beast the breaths and never leaves
I’m forced to watch it live
It pleads and never sees
I know not what it gives
It grieves and plays the lead
Never giving though to script
To eat and sleep and breed
Only reason it exists
Experience is bliss
Buried by the ruthlessness
Of being in the flesh
Illusions all the truth there is
So who are you within?
The answer some may never know
We all were blessed with gifts
I’m just writing thank you notes
The soul float and glows
The ego it goes
What he knows
Is we own
Only those and bones
Mount a mission for your mental that’s the throne
No longer servant to your issues and it shows
Some may misuse turn the temple into unknown forces home
Shit I been through made a master of the matter in my dome
All the plastic and the actors don’t have action where I roam
It’s a battle with the clatter anytime I write a poem
So
Don’t take it as a game
It’s written from the pain
Just so all the seeds know
We’re grown from one and the same
Divine encased in evil
So really I can’t complain
My mind had tasted free fall
Before I had a name
I was dipping diving flying towards the Earth
Right on time when I arrived here for the birth
Now I’m crying what’s it worth?
Life hurts (hertz)
Like sonic energy
If every soul is kin to me
Then why I see division?
Chasing after wisdom cause the ignorance has risen
Facing a collision so I’m lacing up the rhythms with the message from the visions
And I’m just praying that you get them

[Outro: Jim Carrey]
I suddenly felt
Like I was looking at these thoughts from another perspective
And I wondered
Who is it that’s aware that I’m thinking?
Suddenly I was thrown into this expansive amazing feeling of freedom
