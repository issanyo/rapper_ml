[Intro]
Ah-hah! I might gotta take my shirt off (yeah, kid)
I like that one (uh-huh, go in, go in!)

[Verse}
Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car
I got five hundred, hundred packs in my backyard
Clear twelve-twelve's that look like stuff shells
I'm cuttin' niggas throats on the sails while they puff L's
Don't leave nothin' unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything (to save everything)
They come by one more time they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that
Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me (Run!)
Besides that, I got about 5 years on me (Run!)
Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me (Run!)
My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me (Run!)
It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the through-way
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm tryin' hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm asthmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
'Magine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do

[Sample]
Baby, I hear you knocking at my door, I look
Baby, I hear you knocking at my door, I look
Baby, I hear you knocking at my door, I look
