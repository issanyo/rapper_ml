[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
C-A Dr. Flow more
Got bars like I fucking had no doors, they don't want
But shut your mouth like a cold sore
Sick like herpes, y'all can never hurt me, nah
Daydreaming got me hoping for wealth
Yeah, I'm calling myself and I'm focused to help
Keep it brighter than a street light
We fight, all up in this Keef
In the meantime, can't you see we high?
You hip-hop generics are weak
I'm Leif Erikson, watch me as I sever the beat
Yeah, I'm clever to speak, as I pleasure the peeps
Show her how to ball, brush the dirt off my cleats
Gon' do it, gon' do it, attitude precipitate
Leave 'em all wet with the reapers on deck
What the master gon' make
I'mma trash your whole state, won't last
Bet that I'mma gas a full tank, we um
Right skating, bank making, swank shaking
Leaving all the cats waiting
What's next, man? I've been waiting for a minute
But I masterpiece forms, do the time, look within it
So, I grind on ma', I'mma grind till my limit
Press on a shooting star like I'm Billy Kidman
Don't dig 'em, this is what Chris did put me in a mindset
Where I don't minds jet
Timeless rhymes when I find this, I don't lie
And I put it on my eyelids, open, yeah
And now we got you hoping on the one
E'erything, high track got you soaking in the Sun, yeah

[Hook: Nyck Caution] x2
Ah, we so deadly
Bossed with redemption, lost with progression, fenced in
Flow sick, unhealthy, P-E-L-P
Pelp you, pelp me, ah

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
This that 5 star, Top Chef, bringing you that hotness
Won't stop until my name's never forgotten
A prophet, resembling a god in flesh
But the way he spit it was monstrous - Loch Ness
Had it locked down since a child
Now I'm in the clouds raining hell on that
Make it rain rap sound, rollin in like thunder
Ninth wonder, and I keep a pipe like plumbers
Causing a scarcity, on trees on tundras
Gone green, by all means like entendres
Insane in the membrane, and mitochondria
You niggas synthesizing, any light, you might've conjured up
Got hits, but the Pros went and countered ya
They calling us a pain in the ass like suppositors
Ill minded just trying to remain positive
And spit it hotter than a top of a thermometer
Illiterate, real skilled lyricist
PEEP coming soon, this is just the gist of it
We too ignorant for ignorant
A major league problem if you pitching it
Pro Era

[Hook]
Ah, we so deadly
Bossed with redemption, lost with progression, fenced in
Flow sick, unhealthy, P-E-L-P
Pelp you, pelp me, ah
Ah, we so deadly
Bossed with redemption, lost with progression, fenced in
Flow sick, unhealthy, P-E-L-P
Pelp you, pelp me, ah
