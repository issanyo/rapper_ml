And watch the balls erupt
The break was so loud that it hushed the crowd
That it hushed the crowd
Hushed the crowd
The break was so loud that it hushed the crowd
It all grew quiet and still
And sunk the one
And thus begun

The break was so loud that it hushed the crowd
That it hushed the crowd
Hushed the crowd
The break was so loud that it hushed the crowd
It all grew quiet and still
And sunk the one
And thus begun
