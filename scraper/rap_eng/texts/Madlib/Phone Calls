On a winner's roll, for how the winners go
My life is a "3 piece-free dinner roll"
I'm writing to see the seams where the middle's sewn
And rightfully be a fiend for a bigger stone
The irony in my neighbors feeling the same
How I'm looking for baguettes and they waiting to get a trade
Hoping it's 80-20, it's more 40-60
They can paint you the world when the talk is all whiskey
I'm in the same vision
They blind enough to let us
So if diamonds is forever
Then why not just chase prisms?
The hoodie black and the 'Brons is grey Prisms
The goal is to leave with your hearts and grey brim 'em
I'm dating all the broads they hiring for they vids
The money they paying them is the bottles that's in my crib
Encouraged to stay with em, but yo, I just be on my shit
Dying for the moment is dying enough to live
For the record, as true as the truest is
The dudes I grew up with is the dudes that's doing bids
So, with no big brother stretching his arm
Swear to God my co-sign is where the peddlers are
I mean, thirteen, writing rhymes on the step
Looking for a metronome and only sirens was left
So the verse was to the horn
And working in a song
Had me jumping to a trumpet full circle all along
And when them horns blow, they play what the vibe be
If motherfuckers wait, you'll be waiting to find reach
I mean, they said my mother got cancer in her breast
And my pops got cancer in his neck
It turned out my mother is straight, but my pops ain't as blessed
So he at a cancer center trying to rest
I pray to God the money I'm chasing is at least worth the journey
And the ones who lose lane is the ones who was trying to murk me
Cause good aim will have them hanging your jersey
Like, "Son had good game, it's a shame to hang it early"
Early to the money and missing a phone call
I hope when I call back and get him, I don't bawl
Ivy League mind full of prodigal thoughts
And when he was fathering me, I was fathering y'all

One time..
One time for the phone call
Hoping when I call back, I don't bawl
