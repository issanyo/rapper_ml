I flip it on ya
Like we outer space
I'm the type of nigga
That'll never leave the same taste
On your head knot
Coming through like head nods
Snakes and sharks and (?)
Lyrical speed knots
At your dome piece
Rocking my sound piece
Niggas (?) peace
While I'm in search of peace
Niggas falling down
(?) hoes walking past

(Devastating)
