[Verse 1]
It's nothing to be stepping up and coming with the vibe
They're loving to be bunning like the summer in July
Coming with the shit that's fatter than a yatty on the pill
Slip a reeler oh the women slapping on the Vagisil
Young killers are packing steel where I'm living at
Skinning out the rizla with their fingers in the sack
Of that lime green skunky shit
And dumb chicks around the way are into sucking dick
Hip hip hooray while the police investigate the latest murder case
Nobody in the neighborhood has got a word to say
The red tape is blocking off the end of my street
I see the same fiend begging with no crepp on his feet
Keeping it live
So feel the vibe...

[Verse 2]
I see shottas in the ends, shottas in the ends
Plotting like the money and the profit never ends
When I had the product I was out here on the regular
Getting up at 9 in the morning yawning and selling skunk
The blunts kept me high for hours
Around the guys who say they got the white and sell you flower
The boys are getting louder
Whenever they have a drink or puff the izm
Asbo's saying fuck the system
Because it's nothing to be stepping up and coming with the vibe
They're loving to be bunning like the summer in July
Keep it live
So feel the vibe
