[Intro]
Go on to the next shit

Which I want you to listen to me very carefully
The text says very simply
Its not the man
Its the plan
And
For those of us who need
More explicit explanation
Those of us still caught up in the dreams
That rhetoric will solve our problems
Let me put it another way

[Verse 1: Georgia Anne Muldrow]
Prosaic lifelines
Retrieve sunlight wisdom of a new identity
And uh interplanetary justice
Is uh, the INI

Madlib on the music yah
All in sound yah
Well evidence of sunray within my human flesh
I can see the world
From what our trueness gives
With melody surrounding
Our each and every step
Sending back the love (?)
Fragments of an earth will still be living things
The evidence of love resides in everything (everything)
(?)
Can't you see
Can't you see

[Verse 2: Georgia Anne Muldrow]
Damn
Blasting
Up from out the box 'cause (?) never giving up
My only motive is to be with the one
Inside the solar orbit of solar humanity
But then the answer balance all questioning one
Moments of the heart have contained centuries
Pieces of a dream somehow aren't meant to be seen
And even when the heart don't beat
The grace of virtue'll sweep me off of my feet
Supreme reality is the identity of we
That's real
And that's real

[Sample: (?)]
(?)
Good to see all of y'all
See at first I was nervous
So I had to go out to the parking lot
With a friend of mine
Get my (?) together
(Sniff sniff)
So the boy is ready now
And its mellow to be out here
I always dreamed of being in Hollyweird
