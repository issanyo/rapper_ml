Hehe, Good morning Sunshine
(Damn) Good morning sunshine
(Yo) Good morning sunshine sunshine
Good morning Sunshine-shine

I ain't the cat y'all saw yesterday
At least, I mean by tomorrow I won't be anyway
Whole new ballgame, (whole new day!)
Bugs you, don't it?
You overgrown headlight
I asked you for the last time, why you so unkind?
How many years a time I ask you?
You just make us blue
You don't look out for us the more you do
Curious, curious, yellow, ain't you
(Now, I ain't religion)
You know I don't go for that chosen view
(All right just testing you)
Rain
That sure is lame
You must think I stone lost my brain
Rain
Boy, that sure is lame

Good morning sunshine
I ain't the cat y'all saw yesterday
At least, I mean by tomorrow I won't be anyway
Whole new ballgame, (whole new day!)
Curious, ain't ya?
Curious, yellow, ain't ya?
My Aunt Emma
She drowned in that boat on labor day
She was wearing that big wide yellow hat
It was all yellow and brand new
The hat was green and she was too
(Everyone was there)
When they found her
Because she didn't come up right away
Reverend Coleman said it was to punish her for her fast ways
But he always talk like that anyway
(It's contradicting)
Trying to scare folks to grease his tray
(Be praised)
At least that's what my Uncle Leroy used to say
And Emma was always the practical one
In the family anyway
(The bitch in the park has your number
It's gonna hit today)

Good morning, sunshine
I ain't the cat you saw yesterday
At least, I mean by tomorrow I won't be, anyway
Whole new ballgame, whole new day
And the first thing I'm gonna do is send down a box load of roses
And have em put on Aunt Emma's grave
Next I'm gonna buy myself some shades
So if I'm out today, I won't have to look at you
Laaaaast time you and that garment district Cadillac
Gonna trump on me
