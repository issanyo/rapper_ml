The last song on A-F-R-O DOOM
Ha ha ha
Hope ya'll enjoyed it
Chill

Another visionary picture with the tall screen
On scene, long John green spot mockery
Shot Ross the Janitor, the cashier at Walgreens
Had fear in arms (Womp, womp)
I'm Charlie Brown, spark a pound, talk aloud and walk onwards
To the darkest round, somber in fond songs, mark a sound
Exclamation point, detonation joy
Meditation ploy, said amazing Etta James joints
The music plays
The beautiful and mutual illuminated, discomboomberated, mutilated shame
The person in the mirror hurts first when you're nearer
You learn clearer, all concerns worsen the urge to hear it
I wish a different dimension splits images in each significant direction
Every choice I make is specific selection
Since infantry I reckon I was infinitely edgin'
A non-successful life, shocked potential lies
Locked utensils pry the optical advice
Which draws eventual sight
Life is a gun-battle with myself every night, robbin' me

The A-F-R-O villain
Gives gratitude and sends thanks
To all the people who've been there since
Day one

I got my dude, Blind Toxic who helped me with this
5-track special project
To myself

I got my brothers, Overcast, holdin' it down
Those are my dudes right there

Y'know... I got... I got...
Everybody... holdin'...
In the heart of A-F-R-O the villain

Ha ha ha haa

And all of ya'll that smoke... I ain't even mad
KEEP SMOKIN'

We gotta get this shit off our heads someway, huh

Ha ha haaaaaa... ayyyyyyye

All ya'll, peace

And A-F-R-O villain will be back...
