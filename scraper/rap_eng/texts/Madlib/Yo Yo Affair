[Intro: David Peel]
I pledge allegiance
To the bag of marijuana
Made in Mexico
And to the public that's always stoned
One nickel or a dime, forever!
(Cheering)

[Hook: Frezna]
Bring me up when I am down
Take me there to higher ground
Leave me then I'm coming down
It's just a yo-yo affair
(Repeat)

[Verse 1: Frezna]
Don't wanna mix you up with nobody else
Just like your idol all to myself
Maybe I'll pass you 'round with my folks
And when you're back I'm feeling choked
My mom and dad are losing sleep
Saying what will the neighbors think
Some say they'll lock us up if together
Sentence if I give you to another
There are times I wanna roll you up
One of my friends tells me to stop
But they don't know how good you are
You have me floating with the stars

[Hook]

[Bridge: Frezna]
You help me to escape
From the day to day
Of this rat race
Put a smile on my face
Its that good addiction
Bringing me satisfaction
I'm numb from all the pain (all the pain)
I see clear skies in the rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain

[Hook]
(x2)

Its just a yo yo affair
Its just a yo yo affair
