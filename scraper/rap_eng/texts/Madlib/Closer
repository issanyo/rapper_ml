[MF Doom]
Physically, mentally, spiritually not nowadays
Madvillain get more spins than the power plays
These hymns earned him a tower of praise
Wet more Timbs than agua from shower sprays
First dropper to the last
The same way the super got hits for that ass
Put so much heat out on the street
He lock his self up and put the beat on repeat
Stamp here go a kite to the world
It's more nasty than what you write your so called girl
Tramp a spade is a spade
Spit blades like V playing with grenades
He say these black negro's is crazy
Hey these wack trees don't even phase me
Part of a new race
Chrome face 24/7 stay screw face
Play home base

You'll never come closer to where they want to be

Soldiers in the out field
With or with out a deal
Is it all about the steal

You'll never come closer to where they want to be

Ask yourself the same question
Don't mention it to him or any of his henchmen
This flows style in exceptionally
It grows wild and splits exponentially

[Quasimoto]
MF DOOM, QUAS high like sky scrappers
Quasimoto gettin more ass than toilet paper
Who
Astro Black on attack you up on the bozack
Know smarts
Lightweight
Ya bald head like Kojak
[Madlib]
Kinda like a wild cat out of his habitat
Tryin to grab the door mat
Close to the combat
[Quasimoto]

Holdin a black cross
Ya hat toss
[Madlib]
Ya'll niggas on some skinny dip
[Quasimoto]
Looking at his henny sip
Look at little pretty chicks
Sucka's tryin to penny flip
Niggas looping any shit

[Quasimoto]
Yo, yo
What's the password, curse word, last word
Huh
It be the fat serve, mass nerve, black bird

You'll never come closer to where they want to be

Quasimoto down with Madvillian
All up on our shit while ya'll nigga's all be killin

You'll never come closer to where they want to be

[Quasimoto]
Always on the up and up
Chocolate heat for beat
Ya sucka's always fuckin up
