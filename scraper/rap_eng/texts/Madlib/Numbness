[Verse 1: Maleik Dion]
Easy breathing
Heavy beating
Right behind the chest that’s heaving
Hunting like its open season
Just to give the rhyme a reason
Needing new light
Despite the brightness sight and silent comfort
Must recover from the numbness slumber I’ve been under
Otherwise I’ll suffer from another something syndrome
Stuff the substance in ‘em just to get ‘em through the service industry?
God damn!
These surface lives is ending me
They serving lies relentlessly
I search to find and seek the deep
Surf my mind and feed the meek
My streams a sea
Some thoughts are creeks
You’re too weak to peep what’s underneath
You see Maleik
You face defeat
Like sleeping at your cousins
I take flight
While these mother fuckers buzzin
Back when I wasn’t cold
I was just an embryo
But now I’m older bro
Fighting life with righteous soul
Although I know I often find my foe
In my own dome
Suited like the romans
For a battle
With my shadow
Owing only my own negligence
Omens show I’m heaven sent
Hesitant
But excellence
In presence of my next of kin
That’s Jadie
ImanI know we bout to be the greatest
Game is done cause we ain’t playing
Checking in these reservations
I’ve been impatient with the process
Motivation ain’t an option
It’s a must and trust I got this
Stopping conscious is impossible
The obstacles of darkness farthest from the light
In sight they slightly dissipate
So focus love and slay the hate
Praise up above
You like my blood bruh if you relate
Just take mistakes
And make them fuel to feed the pace
You chase your place in fate
The sun will rise sun it ain’t too late
