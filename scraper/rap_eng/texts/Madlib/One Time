[Verse 1: Dskillz Harris]
I wonder what it would take for labels to notice me
Would it be the reunion of Dru Hill and Jodeci?
I'm just trynna let it be like Nina
What's Love Got to do with it, Like Tina
And Ike
I break mics
With these vocals
Kill you, and your local focal points
While I write these global joints
That you can feel, like the cold steel
That was used to reveal, the man who you believe
Stole the wheels off your ride
But was that just a dream
It was that, triple beam scheme
That was used to kill teams and teens
I'm just trynna get my Queen to come like it's mandatory
Waterfalls across the walls and now ya'll get the story
Counting inventory, fridge and freezer, empty
That food in your mouth, looks good homie
Don't tempt me
Heart Darker than Wesley, Snipes
I'll put this microphone down your wind-pipe
