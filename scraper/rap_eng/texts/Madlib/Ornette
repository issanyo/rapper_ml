Many people, even Methodists
Find that after smoking for hours
Particulary with good grass
They'll still fell absolutely no effect the first two or three times
For them, we recommend needlepoint, weightlifting
Or any of the traditional methods of reaching Nirvana
(I can lift 347 pounds over my head but still nobody likes me)
We believe that except for a few weirdos here and there
Everybody can feel the effects of grass
Fortunately all the barriers which keep a person from getting high
Are easily overcome once you know them
The first barrier to overcome
Is the belief that smoking grass gives one a kick
It does not
You do not get a "kick" nor a rush from grass
The second barrier is
That there's no way to know how you're supposed to feel
So you don't know what to look for
And the third barrier is a roadblock
You papers please
(Um I only have a pipe man)
Then you better come with me

Creativity
Time and space
Your awareness of time and space also becomes confused
Things seems to take an unearthly long
Time

I've just been reading a very important motion picture script
Which has already been filmed
Why am I reading the script
When I could be watching the movie
Simply because I feel this film is of great importance
Not just to the Afro-American community
But to all negoes
For this is the first motion picture to our loyal knowledge
That has dared to be suggested
By the life of the late reverend Dr. Martin Luther King
Junior
It serves as a living testament
To the dignity of man
And to the beauty of his woman
That I urge you to owe it to yourself
To undergo
This uplifting cinematic experience
