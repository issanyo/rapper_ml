[Intro Skit]

[Verse I: Guilty Simpson]
She had a coke bottle frame and a random name
I can't remember; however, when I ran my game
She was so into what I was saying and shit
Back then it was so hard to stay with a chick
'Cause I was pulling every pretty face giving me the play
But this one makes me wish I would've went and stayed
I believe in don't call for days, playing strong and drop by
Pretending like doing this with the wrong guy
I apologize I told a lot of lies
All for lust till trust was compromised
And after me, I heard she did a lot of guys
Scorn and resorted to camera-less porn
Every pair of jeans is flashing the thong
All she know is fuck a dude, get cash, and be gone
In-n-out of bars in-n-out cars, stricken hard
Call girl knock the bass head on the boulevard
Ten piece no question, but it's quite wild
I feel responsible that she choose the lifestyle
It was the winter, but I played it colder than December
A time that we vowed to remember

[Verse II: Guilty Simpson]
She had dark brown eyes that can hypnotize
I still remember, a lot of times I made them cry
I never meant to be what they told you I was
Sobering now, I'm probably blowing your buzz
You probably paved over them potholes in your soul
When a chick finds a boyfriend and hormones
But I was young, you feeling me
I didn't understand relationships, responsibility
Heartbreaker when I did her dirty for another broad
I found another girl, didn't take another call
Cold turkey, remember when you said, "Don't hurt me"
Now I'm acting like you ain't worthy
Years later, I saw her with a dude in the mall cashing out for clothes and new shoes
Face to face with the monster I created
Looking through me with hatred
I couldn't say it at the time how I wish I could've handled it better
At this rate it's like you gonna be mad forever, damn
