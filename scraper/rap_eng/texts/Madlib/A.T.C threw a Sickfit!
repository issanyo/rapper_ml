I use to go to school without the class
While I smoke grass
Off campus without a pass
Some homies couldn't go a day
Without a flask
Or smoke cigs
Couldn't go a sec without a drag
See the results of growing up
Without a dad
No wonder y'all can't ever
Catch Is without a bad attitude
Spit!
Acid without a tab
Never see me like MF Doom
Without the mask
Wanna battle? then you better
Come without the wack
Or get turned off
Like when I see
Flat tits without the ass
God damn, shit!
What am I without the wax?
A dab fiend who's down and sad?..
No!
A accapella
Wahalla setter
Alotta letters
Attention hyperactivity rageaholic temper
Do you got a better idea, what?
Therapy? Ritalin?
Fuck no muthafucka, I like ganja better
Thank God for Hip-Hop forever
From suicide attempts, to stormy weather
That's the only thing that kept my head together
They wonder why I don't try
To not be me, please B..
Y'all some superficial toxic species
Wanna make a nigga turn fake?
That's not easy
That's like me convincing
Aryan skinheads to dress up
In dashikis, while speaking in Swahili
And swallowing helium
Till they talk squeaky
My thoughts freaky!
Bare witness as the kid flips
With a Sickfit!
Names written on a shit list
From blood of a slit wrist
3rd eye be my 6th sense
I can see what heavent sent
And the 666!
