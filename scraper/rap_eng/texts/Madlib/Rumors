Yea Malachite


-Verse 1-
I apologize to my family and fam
A never worked came up with another plan
I'm back it's the man from the motherland
Malachite be the man need no other hand
But damn
Look at my boy Walcott
Tore his ACL and now his World dropped
Gotta holla at the boss hit the world shop
Scout 'em out, help us out, so we reach the top
Yea, no joke homie it ain't funny
See we tryna break banks, Mesut Ozil money
I'm tryna be the change like a cashback
Got the media lookin at my past tracks
Like the french steady tryna wear hazmats
And P.S. G, ha, I know you heard that

Yea

I know you heard that

I heard they said this
I heard they said that
I heard

-Verse 2-
Yo I'm E cause I'm leaving all these MC's squared
When I'm thinkin out the box ain't no MC's there
Feel me, see I always got my eye on the prize
I'm a kinder egg nigga with the gift inside
Suprised?
And now before this window close
I got a couple of cats that I'm tryna show
Dude from Switzerland with that grimey flow
From way back homie that I used to know
Or we can try to make a bid for
This really big kid Pompi from Zambia
On that Mayuka tip
But yo on that note while we in that land
Let's try to sign up and cause a Crisis man
Or since its negative 20, where I be
Could do a really cold track with an Ice Queen
