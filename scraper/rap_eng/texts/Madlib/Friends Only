[Intro]
This's a little quote from one of our geniuses
"You don't have to be a member of the KKK
The Ku Klux Klan, to be a wizard under the sheets"
[Chorus: Ndugu and the Chocolate Jam Company]
Take some time to let your feelings
Let your feelings flow free
[Segue: Jimmy Castor]
What we gonna do right here is go back
You can't hide away from what you'll be, yeah
Way back
Search the sky for new horizons
New horizons
Back into time
For you to hold
Set yourself on the oceans of dreams to behold

Peace to Madlib
[Verse 1]
She said she can't stand em
When she's in need she feels so abandoned
Thought she had a lifetime companion
Instead she got a player
Choose his females random
Hole in her heart big as a canyon
She hates his ways
He gone for days
With his mistress
Tellin' her he out on business
Whenever she questions him
He strikes back viscous
And shows in the relationship
Who wears the britches
Friends always see him
Brand new bitches
Now shes out and a about
With a brand new interest
Yours truly
Dinner and a movie
Why?
We headed to The Radisson
To go get high
Fuck the cigarillo
Stuck wit white widow
Afterwards I'm strokin' it
While she bites pillows (uh)
In the hotel faded
Fell for the game
Now she wants to be traded
[Chorus]
Take some time to let your feelings
(yeah)
Let your feelings flow free
Let em flow free baby
You can't hide away from what you'll be, yeah
(what?)
Friends only
Search the sky for new horizons, new horizons for you to hold
Uh, yeah
Set yourself on the oceans of dreams to behold
[Verse 2]
Said she can't take it
And she knows in her heart
They won't make it
She used to think vows were sacred
Instead a love turned to hatred
For the significant other
I urge she stays with
I can't commit
At least not totally
I don't have to lie when she can't get ahold of me
And honestly, I like it
No strings attached
No attitude when I can't ring her back
A side dish
A late-night-drive-with
Ride or die chick
And I don't have to hide shit
It's up front
No deception needed
Just show up
Receive oral sex
And beat it
My little secret
No one knows
She treatin'
She keep her bank roll on swole
I been all around
Still she down
And I love it
I hit you up when I get to town (peace)
No relationship
Friends only
[Chorus]
Let em flow baby
Yeah
That's friends only
