[intro]
Yo, check, uh

[Verse 1]
Said fuck this, i'm out
Threw da snappy on my cranium
What a misfortune, i'm back at the bacchanalian
Broke one with my capers, the truth punched through the vapor
Cus' when i'm with my brethren, feelings get manifested
They never diss-them, loyalty at its best
And best believe i got em', till forever ends
Ladies and friends, i suggest you pay attention
Im innocent like Lincoln, i hope this makes sense
Cus' ever since i started clapping these tracks with missing claps the claps been missing
Just take for instance, a round of applause, is mind healing
Don't have to sugar coated just let me know if you feel it, cus'
Momma always said that i was special, poppa always said that i was mental
I cook dishes in hell's kitchen something fishy with fishes
But cut more tree these sheets look insufficient
Do they know?
Are they blind?
Will they know?
Will they care?
When they see "Eye Dnt Knx" but its.. cool yo its cool


[Verse 2]
Indigo knights we put up with fights
And top it off we stay relentless, on these indigo nights
I ain't feeling the highs bitterness haze muddy purp for the pain
I swear the daze feel the same
Bout to go low with these vocals, son is still on the rise
And i bet, mom's gon' be proud once she visualizes her son-set
I say peace to my foes
Cus' Kobe didn't break when he knew he had 24s
Now he sittin' on 24's, yo now he sitting on 24s
Its word to the G i ain't living the trap
Might cop a, dub for a dime if the dealer a goof
Poof goes the funds, and im out for the night
My knights are gettin' colder still we put up with fights
Despite the fight i might, resort top and bite
Lounge back ignite the flame bright and lights, but
I won't settle for no wager no bling no major independent with my capers
Things of that nature reload and steam
Cus' what's a kid really worth with just a dollar and dream?
