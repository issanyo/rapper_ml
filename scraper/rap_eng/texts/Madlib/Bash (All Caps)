[Verse]
Who am I?
I'm that guy
Spitting rhymes
About lives just ending
My words are so dark
Police shot at the track for it running
The mainstream is boring
I wanna shoot a school up in Flordia
Cuz that's what hip with the kids nowadays
Right, Douglas?
How many "woke" people
Would get upset by that?
And act so appalled
Like FEMA and damaged animals
The stepchild of the black community
Is now rapping
And better than
"Lil Dick Gucci Ad Libs"
I'm batshit
Crazy, from all these faggots
Who wanna act savage
But I don't have time for these sagging procrastinators
Who think they smooth like a G
Or more like rough than a B
I know it's fun to be me
A shit talker you see
Not doing any favors with the rhymes I bring
But I don't give a fuck
Like Eminem back in '98
I wanna break from these hypocritical cumstains
That got their fame by being puppets attach to the strings
Of social media feeding these whores attention cake
That batter fake and your full of yourself
Like egotistical fat faces with dietary arrangements
To Self Indulgence in some fake shit
Or yell about how they made it
Damn

[Outro]
Before I got with my flows
Like bad dads in America
Motherfucking doom to the pauls
And hang them up in the forest
With Ricegum inside the closet
Stay paying bitches to hug him, fuck him
Make him feel like a Bachelor when he wasn't
Fuck it
I guess I'm lazy with my rhymes sometimes
But let's get this show on a roll
Because fuck it, let's do it live (Ya!)
