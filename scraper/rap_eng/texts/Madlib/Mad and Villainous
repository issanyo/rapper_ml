[Verse 1 - Reiki]
Alive somehow, thought I would be dead
Find what thou, thought twice should be said
Bright young smile, false brides should be wed
Find what style, bauxite could be set
One Eight years old, one great career goal
Once played will boast; much weight, hip-po
Just raped your ear hole, some claim your ear lobe
Touched space, didn't smoke, one wake, your kin-folk
When I on stage rappers start to get rowdy
When I on stage bitches dart to get ‘round me
Require name change swarm through then I ground beef
A fire’s namesake forgot you, they all about me
It’s like they already know that it’s gonna happen
Still fine, this MC, throwed your garbage album
Kid shines, deadly, nose pick shards of shrapnel
Fist like, them bleed, know this hard to handle
Got more lyrics than Chief Keef got bangs
Glock cock, little dance, street format
Costs soar, little cash, he has that
Heart pour, existing fan feel not bad
The EP is coming when it’s ready
Eat beats, study text, so know that I'm deadly
See me, fucking threat, like I'm Jim Kelly
CD fund is spent so let’s make this shit trendy
Reiki, remember I, mad and villainous
Remain G whenever I, plan on killing this
Pain seeps every night, but my talents limitless
Hate me fellow scribes, grand champs of dissonance
When I near you don’t touch mics in fear of jeer
Them will shoot you down gun-sights if pistol near
I done said cuz to tough guys who about the thug life
I got a buzz like bug lights, must be doing sum’n right
