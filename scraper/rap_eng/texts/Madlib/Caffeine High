The providential caffeinated beverage had me lifted
From the seat which I was stationed and was leverage for the spitting
Splitting hairs to get a point across
The axiom is loud, but one's opinion's strong enough to tear this mother fucker down
Ah, it's too late
Confusion had them knotted like a shoelace
The scratching of the head had kept them up just like a toothache
Contenders outta be written up into two lanes
With columns that read who can and who can't hang
Stay separated. Convert my verses to Sanskrit
Too many occurrences do not comply with my bandwidth
This tongue is like a rifle and used more than to shoot cans with
Its to overt how in the world I'm still standing
Handshakes solidify an entendre between two parties who contribute all their ends to the machine
You're a day late and a dollar short
Don't wait to honor your commitments or else you'll be scoped under a monocle
Still forlorn and not a damn thing changed
Wish my story was apocryphal so I can turn the page
To see the happy ending and what messages came
It read "go get the fuck out of your head and get paid"
OK. The safetys off. Precautions on
I berate the over-steppers like a crossing guard
If sawn in half? Easy, I can reassemble the parts then spit it cold enough to make you say the frost bit hard
This starving artist is the one who shifts the tectonic plates
Whenever his tummy rumbles that initiates the quakes
No food on his plate but his eyes have desires
Who will stoically abide to rules that he decides
Pride comes before fall
It's a toss up between no risk at all or taking one for the team
Dream-weaving got me nowhere in no time soon
My room is clean except when sad
It's like a typhoon
Let loose up in that bitch. I tell you It's uninhabitable
(it's a lonely sort of place)
The most loneliest imaginable
Infallible mindsets neglects affect effects
I'm caught up in that web that stemmed from sex
But there's a plethora of directions we can choose for escape
Got a compass to encompass all available ways
With no accomplice my accomplishments are flowing like waves
I took this task on my own, and on my own I'll remain
Fucking buzzing off a cup of that good stuff
No sugar, no cream, dark roasted and it's black as fuck
Vantablack can't compare to the content listed, nor the heart of a contract killer's enough
Still buzzing like a beard of bees
Not what I appear to be
Come across calm but deep down I am like a wildebeest
Score my life to Dilla beats
Scorching like the middle east in summer time is how hot my pot gets literally
