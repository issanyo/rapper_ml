[Verse 1: Epifani Telon]

You got me writin this song
And for a long time
Ive been thinkin bout you
For a while
Ya smile keeps poppin' up
Got my heart poundin like athletes in the clutch
And i'll like to admit
You are my biggest crush
With such beauty makes a nigga bust with love
And cupid shot them perfect arrows at us
Soooooo
I'm just sayin that i'll like to be ya man
And if you would like to agree
I think it'll be the perfect plan
Cuz you know...
I think I love you
When push come to shove you
Always there to help me
When I'm going through some problems
Like the way you smell
And i like the way it hits my nostrils
Like her sense of humor
Got me rollin' like some marbles
But when you near it causes me to stay bottled
My hostile heart is too scared so I'm startled
And start too
Think in a sick way, in sympathy
And visually I like you, you're one bad simile
Her love is the remedy
Scared to say it simple, so I spoke it in a melody
Attackin' beats viciously, I did it for you
I want us to stay permenant like ink tattoos
Girl your heart i'll pursue
Even if the world stops my love for you is going
Got that type of style to make the other girls jealous
She's precious, You can tell by her essence
Got chemistry like chemists
Need ya love like an infant
Happy in ya arms, she's a star
And a queen everytime I play my cards rights
Right
Yea she's the delicate type
Rhyme royal thughts king
She's the queen by my side
And the thoughts of other people
We can just set aside
Cuz you know i think i love you
Do anything for you
When it come to stayin' real
No other girl can touch you
Her lifestyle got a nigga too focused
I'm souless without you in these moments
A poet spittin' love but never shows it
Because that fire in her eyes is ferocious
Doses of that love yeah it got me Ford Focused
But I think first and reminise about my dreams
You the one for me
And i hope that you should know
I gotta grip on ya heart and I'm never lettin' go
