[Verse 1]

Connecticut, benefiting animating relevance
Keeping my beliefs, deceased, released, full of grief
I keep discreet rhymes steep, putting you to sleep
Sweeping floors, shearing sheep, creeping like I'm Mobb Deep
The Infamous photosynthesis, maximum chrysanthemum
Platinum showing them, here I come, among
Millennium Falcons, Italian medallions
Riding dragons, breathing fire, getting hired, getting higher, as required
Society, variety, anxiety, irony like clothes, throwing stones, studio headphones, Oxycodone
What have you done? Smooth monotone, in the Thunderdome, hair comb, when in Rome, Google Chrome, garden gnomes, Toblerone
I'm in the Zone- Sonic Hedgehog, chronic bullfrogs, prairie dog, DoubleTripleMonologue
Flashback Vietnam, hatchback letterbomb
Ears ringing, beautiful singing, game winning, upbringing, spinning, old man's hair thinning
Tough convincing, picture printing, beginning, I'm the Sash Ringing, Flash Bringing, Hash Slinging Slasher
I'mma smash her, competitive rapper, Casper (ghost), average at most
Club dancers, dark necromancers, talk to me when you need a true gangster
Salamander Pink Panther, Chief Commander, hockey rink chandelier, stage banter, Tattletale Strangler

[Verse 2]

Clock you in the nose like a pro, like my is Rocky, piano keys, banana trees, fantasy disc jokey
Oh the humanity, please no profanity, bar fighting, bird sighting, candle lighting
Alright then, I'll write your will with a quill pen, chill then, bad influence to children
Brazilian penicillin, civilian, pavilion, Mary-Anne
Sweet just like a jar of mother's strawberry jam, lifespan, you think that you're the man, repeat it again:
I leisurely deal with pressure better than some guy on a landmine, Don't you know I Heard it Through the Grapevine?
Frankenstein's Monster, GGDoubleThotstopper, grasshopper, couldn't pay the rent like a sharecropper
