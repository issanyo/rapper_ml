(Intro)
Come out to show them...
Like, open the bruise up and let some of the bruise blood come out to show them[1]
Come out to show them, come out to show them, come out to show them {*storm howls*}
Come out to show them, come out to show them, come out to show them... {*echoes*}
{*guitar sound, coughing fit*} Music (bad weed)
Listening to music while stoned is a whole new world (to' up man)
Most cannabis consumers report it second only to sex
And grass will change your musical habits, for the better

{*scratched: "America's most blunted!"*}
{"Soon as he start sleepin, catchin you off guard"}
{"If you'll all gather closer at the phonograph"}
Where Quas at? {"Yo!"} Doom, you got the trees?
{"America's most blunted!"}

(MF Doom)
Quas, when he really hit scar mode
Never will he boost loose Phillies with the barcode
Or take a whole carload on a wasted trip
Or slit White Owl laced tip from tip with yip
Some rather baggies others like they cracks and browns
Catch a tag, roll a bag of swag in a Black'n'Mild
See twist Optimo, just the raw leaf part
The list top gold, bust before beef start
At the Stop'n'Go Mart, actin like a spirit host done it
{"America's most blunted!"} Yeah, yo
Doom nominated for the best rolled L's
And they wondered how he dealt with stress so well
Wild guess? You could say he stay sedated
Some say buddha'd, some say faded
Someday pray that he will grow a foreign barn full
Recent research show it's not so darn harmful (true)
Sometimes you might need to detox
It can help you with your rhyme flow and your beatbox
Off spite to your surprise
Turn a Newport Light to a joint right before your eyes
Tear a page out the good book, hear it how you want it
{"America's most blunted!"}

(Chorus)
{"Comin kinda stupid from the station"} {"blunted"}
{"Amazing loops, loops, loops.."} {"blunted"}
{*"The-th-the-best, the-th-best, the-the-the, the best in your perimeter"*}
Yo I can't find that nigga Metal Face nowhere (oh alright)
{"America's most blunted!"}

(Lord Quas)
Doom! The Madvillain killin mad boom
Consume weed and drink brew 'til we perfume the room
The beat conductor smoke twenty-four/seven
Shady.. you can even ask my reverand
Willie knows, how the Phillies roll, really though
I spend my last dough, to pick up the sticky gold
I spark the lah, but don't {fuck} with speed or trees with seeds
Quasimoto crew, we get keyed
The most blunted on the map
The one astro black, in the alley, with a hoodrat
Hoodrat.. when you try to react
{*belch*} Even your pops got smacked
Even your moms got cracked
Meanwhile!! While my bowl got packed
Drop X so you can have good sex (what, no)
I smoke dank so I can grow me a shank
I got the fat sack {shh} all day I'm on it
Who are we? {"America's most blunted!"}

(Outro)
{"Comin kinda stupid from the station"} {"blunted"}
{"Amazing loops, loops, loops.."} {"blunted"}
{"America's most blunted!"}
Creativity, it's a known fact that grass increases creativity
From eight, to eleven times. In fact, everyone finds that they're
More creative stoned, than straight. So remember!
M-A-R-I-J-U... {*xylophone*} ... A-J-U-A-N-A {*xylophone*}
Mari-ah.. {*xylo*} ..juana {*xylo*} Mari-whana {*xylo*}
{*laughter*}
