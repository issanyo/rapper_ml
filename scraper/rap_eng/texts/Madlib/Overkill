My base form garnered strength thanks to experience
Of living in a world that dealt me blows to my interior
Sirius light shines bright enough to make us visible
When night skies descend over the heads of every listener
Listen up, this is not an obligated sermon
It's a volley to determine if my body can take burning
From pressure which measures up to the suns divine nourishment
For time I'll spit a folly to exonerate nervousness
Aiming towards the borderline of dope and transcendence
Where the sentences I write go on until I want to end them
The crescendo kept them hoping that they'd feel the release
Of climax, times that by like, 50 at least
Now you got yourself a sum that's too large for calculation
Which amalgamates in error cos your ears cannot take it
But the basis shall remain just as it was before the caving of the head
Came in to play due to the words that have been stated: This is Overkill
Word of mouth stabbed them in the heart with
Something that I've longed for to place back in that compartment
I remember walking back from class to my apartment upset, because I always felt like I was outsmarted by the system, my peers, rules, life, et cetera
So I devised a plot to take them out with art instead of a
Highly sought out type of harmful kind of oddity
Which in the end avoided aid of psychopharmacology
I swallowed these capsulated rhymes condensed
And spit them back up for they act as my first line of defense
The time lapse hit me harder than the train I would quest with
To see the sights or attend shows to fuel my gift
Still tristful. Trying to accommodate charisma
If it wasn't for the fistfuls of my hair I would be blissful
Trying hard to chisel out myself a tiny little piece
Of satisfaction from a world that's been riddled with disease, hierarchy and hypocrisy
Fire-starting odyssey routes when standing still because it's obvious that bothers me
My form is an anomaly. Uncommonly found amid
The witness's eyes during a litmus test round
What a let down. Parading with no 'S' on my chest
Creating is never first. It sits at 2nd at best
The first spot goes to planning on how to leave the nest
With my superfluous moves, I need more lessons in chess
So get it out now. My thick skin renders your needles useless
See the blueprints? My map lacks bridges like Beatles' music
That's the problem for I harp instead of building overpasses
Aware the past passed but I can't get passed it. It sounds drastic Crucify a man for being honest
For what you've tuned into, better brace yourself like orthodontists
When that bomb hits
Flipping off big brother's lens tends to bite back the authority by
Ripping off their heads, and when all is said and done you can leave your aggression
People tend to feel better when they go to confession
I guess that any method works better than suppression
Because if kept in, you'll be next to catch wreck
