[Verse 1: PreemClientele]
My team supreme like my clientele
I seem extreme, line for line, I excel
That’s my word, it’s worth the perfect price
The price is right, I right my wrongs until there’s nothing left
I’m done, I’m unimpressed by the rest-
Because the rest are lesser, stressed by pressure
Unless it’s a guest feature, I guess it begets “Ether"s

[Verse 2: swinelord]
​hit that bitch like a cocaine pinata
​just kidding bitch bad, lady better
​don't put things in your butt kids

[Verse 3: $tankyboy]
Where's the crack?
I pop backs like a chiropract, tic tacs inside of crunchwraps, Not that taco smack, whack shacks of lacking slaps, nowhere to wear these crap hats, your fat chaps got ice caps
Touch my nickel wait no I meant pickle, fiddle with your little Blizzard, tiny wiener and cheesbizzle from dairy queen with No smelly cheese,  get at me you smelly queef, no intellect is My game, shame is my name and no sense to blame, I am doo-Doo and you are a poodle, drool with your tools in school Around fools and pools of boo-boo
Couldn't get down wit the cotton mounds
My feces is profound and you're a bitch with no bite, not like Mike and Ike, tasty treats from the streets leave bleeps in your peeps to ponder for weeks with no income
Straight rectum and vasectomy up and down your alley
I mean esophagus and don't forget the pain in ya chest from no rest and all the mess
But nevermind that, back to the real rappin'
Truthfully, as I am currently spitting these lava raps I am fappin'
Cause truthfully, these donkey ass rappers been a fake
OG $tanky, Master of the fuckin' renegade

[Verse 4: JFKray]
You mother fuckers don’t know the meaning of being brave
Scything through rappers gonna put you in your grave
Rising from the underground but buried in a tomb
Cause we always underground until we reach the moon
This is food for thought and every day i consume
So bright and dark may the end be very soon
Because im just seeing red but then maybe im insane
Maybe it’s in my head but im too blinded by change
There is a war i can't avoid that has trapped me yet again
The war inside my mind got me always wondering when
Death is going to strike maybe its tonight
But always left in daze but i still put up a fight
Following in footsteps so hear them coming up
Maybe im an animal i bore this burden fuck
But then yet again maybe im fucking crazy
Cause whatever they say i seem not to let it phase me

[Verse 5: Jimmy-The-Ray]
I shoot up schools like Dylan Klebold or Eric Harris
Blasting them hoods, leavin' niggas embarrassed
Puttin’ niggas in graves, rename your hood Paris
I draw out crowds, and put down sheriffs
I’ll renegade you all with half a fucking verse
You’ll want your money back but I don’t reimburse
Sorry son, go back home with your empty purse
And I'll just lie here strapped to the operating table, fucking the old nurse

[Verse 6: KUZGUN]
The new Satan's son
Hate on 'um
Your soul shall be taken from
You, no one is safe or done
With, fuck this, I might fornicate
Again to porn today
Beat up the ass (Get it?)
That's letters
Being broken down
By the groped-up sound
Of your favorite MC
Being choked to death by a mentally
The nigga ended up
With his dentals stuck
Up his asshole
Blood-splattered Picassos
Fill the murder scene
As the kid you now heard begins
To go on a interstate killing spree
It ain't Jamaal Studz, or KUZGUN,  it's just me
Fucking up the game, until I leave

[Verse 7: LaFlamesAdvocate]
Its past midnight,flashes and rocks lit,fights
Deep in my mind, eyesight filled with creatures
Creeping up from behind
Toughts more crowded than the beyhive, art and death arouse eacho-
Ther
Skip past breakfast,lunch hand me the reefer
My mind punched,as time touches,the ribbon in the sky
Such as past grudges, black and grey pictures,of family dinners
But pass me with the shit and lets celebrate christmas
Salivate,the peace and freedom
White,black,latinas and asians, all from the same family-tree relation
Escape all the preach and hatred, fuck the speech and sancred
Pass the weed,blaze it
Lets just,color the reality we facing, pinata colored landscapes
And bitches dozing of the candy caints and bars
YES LORD


[Interlude: KUZGUN]
Damn, my grandma fell asleep in a dab position (x4)

[Verse 8: KUZGUN]
I'm a Crip and a Blood cuz I'm a Crood
Cuz I'm less intelligent
I'd suck on a baby's vagina TBH
I know, I have weird fetishes
Now let me spit lyrical miracle bars so RG likes me:
My rapsodic demigod reconcilliates orators
AHH! THIS SHIT IS TOO HARD

[Verse 9: Onemanband]
I asked her if she’d suck my dick
She said she’d never go that far
So out of curiosity I offered her a klondike bar
You know they’d do anything for it
Start speaking spanish, have Donald Trump get you deported
It’s not a question of reality it’s what’s bout to happen
And pretty soon it’ll be illegal for you to continue rapping
Cause we take offense to everything that makes people laugh
Fuck Spongebob and his yellow motherfucking ass
Sue Nickelodeon for defamation of the youth
Fuck the color yellow
I'd prefer to not acknowledge the truth
You're lacking intelligence
Fuck the mother that birthed you
Those bars were irrelevant, just as much as the first two
And they say that having love is a virtue
But I'd rather not indulge myself in the things that could hurt you
My attention span is too short to make a fucking commitment
I might say I love but do you think I really meant it
Told her this could be the best thing that you ever felt
So get on your knees and start before you make the ice cream melt

[Verse 10: NondescriptWhiteRapFan1]
Something something Diddy ad-libs
Your dad's a drunk and your mom's a whore
This is my first time hearing of Freddie Gibbs
I've never even heard this song before
Yeah I know the verse is late
But it's better than having no verse at all
Without me the cypher can't be great
Like a kid with Downs doing a backwards crawl

[Verse 11: Sicarius]
Reese's Pieces, blood of Christ, the Jesus
Adam and Eve is, the saints can't even believe this
I'm a legend, been one since Vice City
I'm only fuckin' with your bitch, she got nice titties
I spit inferno, I burn your rap career
I get in a minute what you get in a year
I get in a second what you get in a month
Clan in the front, boy, let your feet stomp!
