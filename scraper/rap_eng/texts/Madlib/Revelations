Revelations...
Don't stop keep on
Sunshine

Flaco

[Verse: Mos Def]
Boogieman
Standing in the sun getting black as I want
You playing good D, and that ain't backing me up
Skywalker baby, ain't no jack in my hammer
I got a whole lot to say so I ain't talking to them
I hear em eavesdroppin
I turn it up louder
Black freedom, black genius, black power
Black ink for printing the black dollar
And tell the CIA I say, now what?
And cc: is central bank
Loose change body slamming big money tanks
We tell god thanks
Ya'll tellin us god don't rank
That's why your breath stank
Yuck
Lay off the bacon and smokes
Quit laying off the good working folks quit the hoax
And lay off the corny color jokes
And contrary to popular the coloreds is awoke
Ya big dope
Yuck
Keep them out your face keep em in your prayers
Either that keep em in the cross hairs
Better still keep a even dose of each cause until you get justice
You won't get peace
Peace peace peace peace peace
The gun shot say wa da da dang
Wa da da da da dang
Wa da da da da da da da da dang ay!
They shout peace peace peace
They shout peace peace peace
The firefight lit wa da da dang
Wa da da da da dang
Wa da da da da da da da da dang ay!
Rumors and rumors and rumors of war can I get better now what is that for
And more
Rumors and rumors and rumors of war killers just killing now what they kill for
And more
Rumors and rumors and rumors of war can I get better now what is that for
And more
Rumors and rumors and rumors of war
Revelations
Dont stop keep on
