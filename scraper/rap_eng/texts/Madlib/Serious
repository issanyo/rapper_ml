[Intro: M.E.D.]
Welcome, yeah
Now I got y’all niggas in tune
And our next, check, what
I got them like

[Verse 1: M.E.D.]
Damn, what the fuck is bumping out the system like this here
No we ain’t from around here
Sounding so reckless I break stacks, snap your neck, shit
Reactions breathless the world’s now effected
Perfect this game separated into two sections
Got the hustle to hustle, focus on the bundle
Now it’s coming down to this year homies turn for the skrill
So haters eyes burn when the piss clears
Nigga, this year, I switched gears, picked [?], push fields
Of how to produce bills then lie low
Mitchell & Ness [?] throwback [?] with the Velcro straps
Homie we so serious

[Chorus: M.E.D. & Oh No]
When it comes to these papes, [?] mistakes choose your fate, so
Serious, yeah
Niggas love to hate, plan a theft, dog for the cake be
Serious
With these words I preach, speak from the heart (turn it up) the beats so
Serious
If you ain’t

[Verse 2: Oh No]
So serious, that we don’t give a fuck now
We out trying to move trying to snatch up that experience
And they always curious, steady wondering where we’re at
We out hustling watching the city crumble down
[?] rebuilt my speech, mental uplift like heat up under your seat that can lift you with the ease, take it
Seriously, time is the realest think of something [?] the game
So mysteriously, snakes turn more vicious than streets
They on them waiting and plotting their victim found lost in front of dark phantoms
All for the dark liquor you’ll get manhandled, dismantled
All random, the mammoth, the situation’s serious

[Chorus: M.E.D. & Oh No]
When it comes to these papes, [?] mistakes choose your fate, so
Serious, yeah
Niggas love to hate, plan a theft, dog for the cake be
Serious
With these words I preach, speak from the heart (turn it up) the beats so
Serious
If you ain’t
