[Verse: 1]

Yo yo check
Ay I've been with you since foreva
I've seen the worst and the betta
And I know you can do betta
Keep your mind right for that chedda
And life can seem like a miss
But I'll be right here and give you that assist
Droppin' dimes, while the dime bags drop
And sooner or later you gon start sellin' that rock
But remember yo block, and yo family
Grind right now, so later you can live lavishly
And the girls will come, they be the baddest B
And the fans will grow much rapidly
Colorado Rapids, the green be easy
I know you lookin' fly my B, stay steezy
Blowin' on that loud and get breezy
And soon you gon meet Yeezy
But for now you gotta stay low
Cuz killas got canons and they gon let it blow

[Hook]
So you gotta watch your back my G
You know I'll be right here if times get tough my G
So you gotta watch your back my G
You know I'll be right here if times get tough my G

[Verse 2]
Perpetrating with the flow
I know you got gold, but you gotta follow yo goals
And I know you be getting distracted
But you gotta stay focus through the madness
You gon get challenged, and faces challenges
But down back down, no matter how hard it is
Be free, cuz life ain't a breeze
It's more like a blizzard, you just gotta jump over walls, my wizard
My hitta, You a YG from the west beach
Life's a beach but don't treat it all nicely
Cuz the waves gon wash up, and the sand will dry out
And when that fight comes, just knock his life out
I see you ridin' dirty with that sprite
But you seem to shine at the night
Always knew that yo mind would stay bright
Know you gotta battle these Knicks like Mike

[Hook]
