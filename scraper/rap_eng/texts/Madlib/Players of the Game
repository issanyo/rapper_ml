[Sample]
We're all apart of the game!

[Verse 1: Quasimoto]
Will smile in your face for a taste of the cheese
Fallin' out of the races, stay on your Qs & Ps
Ps & Qs
Good news, bad news
Shitty reviews, a critic's appraised views
Fans will drive miles for hours to hear what you're sayin'
If you're shitty, niggas throwing bottles in their city
Leave vibrations, though a positive mind frame

[Sample]
It's all a part of the game
We're all players in the game!

[Verse 2: Quasimoto]
Lose all your money, or double up
Fall off, or bubble up
Breakin' #1 on the pop charts
Or keep it real, drop sound like art
Going wood, in the hood, or getting Grammys
Coming like Neptunes or Prince Grammy
Being yourself or sounding the same

[Sample]
It's all a part of the game
We're all players in the game!

[Verse 3: Madlib]
Fur coats, gold teeth, Raider hats
Tough guys, soft guys, hater rats
Got packed shows, empty nightclubs
Turn this shit into Fight Club
Overseas pub
Make-pay dues
Underpaid show's
More paid dues
Better money, bigger house
Some friends, bigger mouth
Some same, some change

[Sample]
It's all a part of the game
We're all players in the game!
