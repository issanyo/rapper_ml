Yeah this next joint right here
Is dedicated to all my niggas that I love
All the niggas that held it down with me through the whole shit
From the beginning of the fort, to the now current day of the fort
From the beginning and the birth of this whole shit
To the now success of this whole shit
And all my peoples that be holdin' it down for their peoples
Ridin' with them
