[Phil da Agony]

Why you always rap about backwoods
They ain't really all that good
I'm from a black hood where all my black brothers where black hooded sweatshirts
Gold Chains show the net worth
That's my zone and I'm back to work
Hard hat harder
Harder sack to follow
What up Colorado?
What up California, that's where I'm from
My freestyle showtime at the Apollo was dumb
Dum Dum like a gumdrop lollipop
Gun shots will make your body drop
You get molly-whopped
Came back one eye
One eye patch
Cyclops looking like a pirate
Nothing like slick rick popping off
I shit on you niggas
Like I'm sitting on the toilet and I'm dropping off
Nasty ass smoke a lot of grass like a pastime
Told you in my last rhyme
I blast lines on the mic
White boys sniffing lines of the white
Like it's better than hitting the pipe
All my niggas smoke swishers like old men
On the park benches
Playing checkers like Bobby Fischer

[Krondon]

It's hilarious
High times ???
Various ways to get high
You can't concentrate
Work snuck in the parking lot and took a toke
Young dopeheads
Got it at 12 behind the tool shed
No smoke
Squares don't like when it get in their head
Only means more smoke for the player
In the party with the ooh-wee
Snoop Lodi Dodi skunky dook shoe
Probably came in funky like rotten fruit
Backwoody Harrelson ????
Say make a bush sellin burn for the Benjamin franks
At the airport of course you smell the stank
???? On a quest for bank bigger than Hank Williams
New Orleans, St. Peter, Pittsburgh Steelin
Blunts in the club like a bud dealer
???? So it's all paid in full soundtrack
Should have had a song from the battle rap contract
Killers bring the sound of J-Dilla back
With Madlib tracks
Rattlesnake, battleaxe
Impact pack a backwood
Yeah the best thing he told me
Stop smoking that ????
