[Verse]
Never sweat her yo, the aura was ice like
Prize fight suited, i was zooted from the diced white
Calvin coolidge, style cool as a like
Was like, polo sweats stepping in nikes
Bear breathe off my chest, let it rest on the mic
What a mess, what a night, some the best of my life
Be the best, we the best, eat ya breathe and goodnight
Put ya mic away, put ya life away when you write
Take ya occ from you, and put ya life away when i write
Break the gauc with it, 12 o clock glistening lights
In the drop tented, this knocking
Code of silence on my wrist watching
She came out with them kitten stockings
Bob cut, bob dorough deluxe
Slick talking, kiss collars, with my mind on my bitch bossin'
Chip tossin', i miss getting off this much
Miss bout to get often by her name on my resume
Aye, let her stay an hour with us
Galore powder, plural showers and such
Sure ma tour sponsors on us
Gotta get the floor models for the plush in us.."
