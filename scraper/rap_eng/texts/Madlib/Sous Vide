[Verse 1: Mach-Hommy]
The best gravlax is served inside a sauna, foreigner
Agent Provocateur
The albacore was on the corner, karma
Word to pego MAC-10
Pac’s Nefertiti
I’m Vito Andolini no black friends, eh
Flip you like Don Ciccio
Chi-chi man
They wan fi see mi with no bond or la idio
Idiot bwoy
The CD number 1 in my Helios
Sweltering son, it’s hotter than a prepaid
Tuanda said, "dega dejer"
I Shot The Sheriff buggering Wee-Bey, G play
The Donna Karen duffle in the Jeep day
DJ, roll up
Ponder average presser was a keepsake
Reshape, and hang you out to flood on a clean sake
Queens get the money, all I play is Mobb Deep these days
What’s the replay value on that bumbarass weed plate?
I ain’t fuckin’ with you niggas for shit
Witness the shift
Zeitgeist string on a stick, hook-line-sinker wit'-
Brown rice Yellowtail king on a fish
You ever sell ting on a swing
When I was 10 I held my cousin's FN FAL, we on the fringe
The way the béchamel flee on the drip, trip
Givenchy runners with the Montclair sweats, land wrecks
Slide a motherfucker like AmEx
Stretch you like Photoshop
Spandex on Instagram, man will stretch you like yoga mom

Ayo
Ayo
That same energy you put out
It comes right back and revolves, you fraud
You whippin’ up your supper from the trough, rack hittin’ dog
You kissin’ up to buttons on the blog, mack niggas gloss
And spin a muh'fucka for a cost
You have to pry it out my dead cold hands, grams
I spill the bud-
Ahh, fuck!
Ahh!
(You got it)
