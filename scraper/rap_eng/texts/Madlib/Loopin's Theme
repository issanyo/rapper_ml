[Verse: Great Scott!]
Niggas try to dress cool
Steps from an ascot
Peep game and go cop
I'm out this bitch dressed like a fresh fat nigga's mascot
Call my jeans skinny but you like mad cock
Tryna play with Ender's while they dipping in the toy box
Can't fuck with y'all, it's the pussy-licking boy caught
Wait a minute as I Roebuck and see
Telling grudges what it is
And give these bitches what they need
Niggas look like zombies
They over highed on weed
I be sailing over beats like Sinbad on seven seas
Out-rap these niggas 'fore they get a chance to breathe
Got it all, slow up vans, "player tell me what you need"
From the bottom of the loan, so I kill 'em with skill and speed
Top runner soft, so it's spilling out my mouth
Smell like the chicken coming out the kitchen in my momma house
Rising up from my couch
Talking mean rhyme and shit
We done seen starships, got some with laser beams
Later scream, we the cream of the planet
Max Clique, we the fucking team god dammit
Shit finally going hot, we planned it, lyrics to go
Flow to match, that's a 16 sandwich
We gon' say you better that's why mic's get brandished
Ego's get damaged, styles leave bandits, nigga
Back to the drawing board you need to go bigger
If you win it or you loss
You're a worker or a boss
Helped build the bandwagon
You'll get kicked the fuck off
Great Scott! signing off
