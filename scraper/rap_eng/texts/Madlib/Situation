[Verse 1: Madlib]
Sweet heart (?) no shame
You're out playing love like its a game
I thought you was 'sposed to be chilling at work
Called around and found out you was chilling with a squirt
Why your face with a shock?
Should've thought about it earlier
Before you got diss (?)
But Imma chill and remain the same
On insane in my head like (?)
Its like someone shot me up with some lead
What my girl playing me?
Now that's dead
You know the cause, get lost
With no tears I'll be maxing
Take you off my list, that's subtraction

[Verse 2: Madlib]
I got more questions
Why did it have to go down like that
Now I wanna ill but I can't strike back
My brother told me and I knew I should've listened
Now I feel mad stupid when I start reminiscin'
About you whenever and I bet you thought you
Was never when you went on your secret endeavors
I remember (?) end up late at night
Now all we seem to do is fuss and fight
I put all my time, trust, and faith in you
I thought we would be like forever true
Played the game but (?)
Take (?)
