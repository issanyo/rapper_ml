Yo, it’s Jimmy E.L.E, and this freestyle is called Omne Ignotum Pro Magnifico, Everything Unknown is Taken as Grand.  Shout outs to Freddie Gibbs and Madlib for the beat, it’s real sweet, yeah, here it go, uh

Omne Ignotum Pro Magnifico, I move rhymes like a wave through the south pacifico, treasures like the count of monte cristo’s gold/
Traversing oceans with these potent rhymes important, soaking the opposition, hoping but they mostly floating on unstable raft/
See when you step into the path of this most able gab, you’ll get disabled then enabled into flotsam drag, call me awesome bad/
Whatever kid, if it fits I’ll wear it, as long as adjectives matches my appearance/
I’ll stand fearless like a kid in Gaza, I’ll do it for my kin, the Muslims, and every single person of my raza/
Word to my father and mother earth, for what it’s worth, is going through extinction, but people are only thinking about their work, how much they made, and what’s the price of lemonade/

Yo

Deep like the abyssal plain, take a peep in my abysmal brain, unless you’re pink like pepto bismol lame/
Well then you couldn’t handle it, cause most of ya’ll are carbon copy laminates, useless like some rusty knives in wooden cabinets/
Take a stab at it, I dare ya, this triumphant victory will be your failure/
If you parry, then I parry back, dressed in all black like miss mary mack/
You can’t hit what you can’t see, especially when I’m moving at lightspeed/
Constant elevation, never no stagnation we prefer damnation/
A year in hell will make him tell/
The fire has a fury/
Burning through the empty shells of people in a hurry/
No mcflurry’s, no blizzards, so scurry/
Into decrepit destitution, pay for the soul you prostituted/
