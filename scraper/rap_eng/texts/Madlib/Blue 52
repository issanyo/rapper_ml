I feel my duty as a citizen within
Is to condemn the many banker men by belittling them
Then begin to spin the lies they spun back into truth
This act of refusal's very hydrofracking induced
I got the strongest motive written on the backs of my crew
Causing spontaneous combustion when we come into view
It’s not only that we do what we do, it’s that we do all of you
Until you understand what you never knew
This wealthy-living lifestyle doesn’t tempt me yet
Cause it's all about the green like an empty set
So I'mma set the scene: ghetto inner city backdrop
Dollar bills fall meaninglessly onto the blacktop
Equality, equality, the core of my philosophy
And honesty, honesty, the one and only policy
That’s more dope than an opium hit
More dope than Bill Gates dapping Ethiopian kids
Searching for love got me lost in a wilderness world
Where trees drop leaves of love letters written to girls
Pearly vines intertwined into the truly divine
Too bad those vines are too brittle for anybody to climb
In the mean time, I fiend rhymes like the Brits do tea time
The beats are my crumpets and you'll crump it to these lines
They hide the Pentagon tapes of a missile that B-lined
I’m saying rewind but I’m not going to be kind
Maybe they’ll discredit me for speaking my free mind
And occasionally talking 'bout girls  that I want to get behind
But honeys won’t neglect that I am poking the bee hive
You don’t need three eyes to be wise to these guys
I’m throwing peanuts at the elephant in the room
You can say “fuck the world” but you were celibate in the womb
Boom, bap, bam, this cracker's smearing on the jam
Once I get a little butter back from the republicans
Man, I’ve had enough comparisons to Eminem
But then again look our skin, it’s nowhere near some cinnamon
I guess you could say we’re the same in lyrical ways
The way that Buddhists and Christians are in their spiritual praise, "Hey
You over there bobbing your head
How bout you turn the music off and let me frisk you instead
Let me ask you do you have any narcotics or drugs
Do you define yourself as a thug, been shot by a slug
Had one of your mug, then told to rat your boys by a bug?"
What? Are you some sort of drug-money detector?
Well if you’re looking for dirty money protectors
Frisk JPMorgan’s Board of Directors
There’s more illegal cash in the private sector
Than every 3rd world countries net worth put together
I’m on a banter searching all the answers
Living in a world where debt is the gold standard
I’m gonna turn the projects in poverty to commodities
Of high value property so justice is served properly
And if you think a dollar sign is stopping me
Your cycloptic optics arn’t properly working upon this Odyssey, What
