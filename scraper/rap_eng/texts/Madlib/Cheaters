[Sample]
Don't it seem like every man
Wants another man's woman
And every woman is looking at another girl's man
So the partners change around
But the happiness just don't seem to get found
Is there no love when its right in the palm of their hand

[Verse 1: Poke]
Ay, I had a cool something stuff her like its Monday after school
Hoping, through our dirt when we get off work
Chop it, screw, fuckin'
Keep it on the low her man don't know
The way she move something
Back side and them thick thighs (Don't it seem like)
That I'm the nigga
That she come to see and get broke off
Within thirty seconds already got her clothes off
Get her wet and gushy rose, smelling like
Pussy keep calling cause she bring the party to me
(Don't it seem like)
She love my swagger, love the way I throw dick at her
The way her mouth spit, speak, chatter
Don't drink Henny, drink Heineken
When I'm with my partners you call one of your finer friends
Break it down, treat me swell
Give head well, kiss and tell, nope
But I can tell she love getting poked
Secret society, a real sex with a rider freak
Nigga called, bitch is saying bye to me

[Verse 2: MED]
Her look struck me like thunderbolts
What her coat (?) cantaloupes
Baby slow, keep my love higher than D'Angelo
Sugar strokes, sweet walls (?)
(?)
I'm slipping
Quarter past ten, thinking daughter spray over deadly
Eleven thirty and I'm at her trailer waiting
In the basement impatient
My acquaintance for the night arrived, I glanced in her eyes
(Don't it seem like) that everything I tell is the truth
Like playing hoops, Saturday I was an (?)
Knocking boots anyway, promise you I'm so true
With no proof then its no lie, meaning I'm so fly
She looked in my eyes, replied, "You're fly times three"
Without wings then we lift off the ecstasy
Float back down, I fell asleep
She digging in pockets when she heard a beep
Damn
