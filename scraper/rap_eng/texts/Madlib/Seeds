[Intro]
People look around you
What do you see?
Children going hungry
Pain and misery

[Chorus]
Seeds, who is on the look out for the seeds
Whose on the look out for
We never, we don't even agree
[?] with me, for the apple trees
Whose on the look out for the seeds
We taking more than we really need
Protect the seeds
So who is on the look out for the tree

Protect the air we breath
Don’t wait, thinking about it too long
Act on what you know, what you feeling
Don’t wait, been thinking about it too long
We got to have it baby
It wrong
This song is magical [?] flower [?]

[Chorus]
Seeds, whose on the look out for the seeds
Whose on the look out for
[?] they gonna need, gonna need
Whose on the look out for
People look around you
What do you see?
Children going hungry
Pain and misery
Seeds, who is on the look out for the seeds
Whose on the look out for
We never, we don't even agree
Roll with me, for the apple trees
Whose on the look out for the seeds

Tell me whatever sea are they to receive?
Only one way to win, rise up [?]
We need to beat
Activate the mind, activate the mind
[?] on the mental fire
