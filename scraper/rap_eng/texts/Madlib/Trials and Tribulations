[Verse: JFKray]
The grand journey through trials and tribulations
I'll wake up early to files or be a tribune patient
Could this birth big things or be a hearse to something little
Should the Earth be a skittle it'll only hurt a tittle
Can I elevate to levitate then I can demonstrate
Celebrate when they immigrate 'cause we liberate
Can we expiate? ban the chemical when polemical
The state don't lift no weight when they don't hold us centrical
It ain't balanced, we in the crypt locked
How do we win when the rich are tipped off
And our paths are criss-crossed like a sickle and hammer
An election's deception acquittal sent manner

Welcome everybody
Sure you reckon that I'm gaudy
Open my mouth, then the venom flies out
Tope in a drought hope's not televised now
Bow to our masters
Or soon become some sour martyrs
Flower gardens burn to ashes
What's before my eyes as my one life flashes?
Stashes of unfinished business
Until the top spot decide to work with us you'll never ever drown my message out
