[Verse 1]
Everybody around me's a blur
I exist in alternate universe where algorithms burst into thin air
I'll go rid them of their existence, been there twisting
The swivel of my chair leaves them distant
Details i never mention, I keep my cool intact
With Babatunde crafting tunes for Doomsday
Rapture coming soon in fact
Under the tutelage of Zeus, I be moving that
Insurmountable boom bap zapping out of a cannon
I told a thousand hoes 'hop on the bandwagon'
They were doubting those pyros
Hanging at the park when it's dark, packing bowls
With patches of grass 'cause we're paranoid
Of the Paterson noise, my backpack
Got these parables, and they paramount
If they on the opposition, point 'em out
Take u to the moon and back
Detach soul from the cracks in the mirror capturing you
Cause I'm in the mood for that
And the glass on your screen ain't shatterproof
Don't look at me with a mask, I travel through
The past so I saw you before the facade
Before they examined your fossil in a faucet appalled
Yeah, my memory is polished
I checked the richness in your spirit and it's clear that
Ya got empty pockets
Diss me, you'll hear a reply for it
Read between the lines, I'm a lion and I arrived for it
Studio's a psych ward, it's mad lit
A madman rapping to Madlib in mad limbo
I want a mansion that's magical for my mom
A myriad of styles, in the mirror that's a child
Fantasizing 'bout dropping albums that ppl are fond of
Was my immediate desire

[Verse 2]
Ayo, we swanging like them chandeliers
The drive that resides inside him gives him right to steer
Horses and carriages, morse code with some bandits
Deliver the messages fast and furious, Paul Walker, Paul Revere
Effortless, Picasso of the posse, pick locks at the party
Hit the jukebox, take some quarters out my tubesock
And let our tunes rock after 2Pac on who's block
I'm hip-hop, just pardon me, it's a pleasure to be here
Instead of being fossilized, understand
My mind is Aristotle colossal size, follow, this that audible
Culdesac, brass knuckles strapped, leave your skull cracked
Soul shattering into shards, pulling of crack the way i'm pulling your card
Jacking your car sapsucker, back the fuck up type of atmosphere
Say I'm not the bomb, motherfucker, watch me detonate
Calm breeze, palm trees ruptured in the dead of night
Bars, push-ups, thoughts and scripture, that's my debt to pay
Twist the flicka's wrist until that bitch has a levee break
Flow, flow, flow, I think you need that
All that shit on your rhyme book, you can keep that
These rappers always acting like birds wanting to tweet that
Charlie Sheens at party scenes, me, I just fiend rap
Believe that
