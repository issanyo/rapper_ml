We Know, We Know (x6)

[Verse: David Dilin]
Yo
I ain't sit 'n' sleepin' through this dreaming full of lullabies
So I had to take my own advice and stay awake
Engaged in conversation, naps seemin' serta fake
So I chat to men well for a minute, dip up in my burgundy whip
And take a ride just for my sake, through this mind state

It's not too far
We're headed through the neck of our woulds and would nots
To the heart of it, through an artery
Inhale falsity and exhale pollution

So then I get to thinking
Tell me why our brains find temporal solutions
To spiritual equations too difficult to root

My integrals compute to first principles and space-time dimensions
I waste time to mention that our facetimes will never get to daytime
I know I can't delay time, so now I have to face my condition

They say mind's a prison. You can call it faith
But I'd say mine is different
So save thine opinions for a person who will listen

I've always been po', like Edgar Allan
Went from Poe Boy to Potent, From Poser to Poet
From Pointedly PostPoned to Pop, check my Position

I know God and His book, a true Son
We've made it to the place from where the Truth comes
Smile on my face, now look what you've done
