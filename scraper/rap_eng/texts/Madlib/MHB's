[Verse 1: Madlib]
Money-hungry bitches all up in my face
Trying to play the role yo I put them in their place
Schemes and dreams to get the dollars from
Them niggas acting dumb, always getting done
While she's bringing money to my mans Quas
She all up on the tip thinking that we're stars
Open up the legs cause the jewels and cars
Leaving mental scars on some she left bars
On suckers hearts cause she knows the game plan
Have your ass looking like the Rain Man
Its up and down like a nigga hittin' switches
Yo y'all got to watch out for the Money-Hungry Bitches

[Verse 2: Madlib]
Money-hungry bitches all up in my face
(Money-hungry bitches all up in my face)
Trying to play the role yo I put them in their place
(Trying to play the role yo I put them in their place)
Schemes and dreams to get the dollars from
(Schemes and dreams to get the dollars from)
Them niggas acting dumb, always getting done
(Them niggas acting dumb, always getting done)
Its up and down like a nigga hittin' switches
(Its up and down like a nigga, hittin' switches)
Yo y'all got to watch out for the Money-Hungry Bitches
