[Sample]
Hey, digga
I feel that actions speak louder than words
Words can be deceiving, often they can really hide one's feelings
You know, man, what you say is jive
What you do, that's what really means something

That's the way it's got to be
That's the way it's got to be

[Instrumental]

[Sample]
You just have to understand
You've got a man on your hand

That's the way it's got to be
That's the way it's got to be
