[Verse 1: Napoleon Da Legend]
Wooden African chain check the stat behind the name
Student of the game like Jay when he sat behind Kane
Max out the game then I’m a stretch it even further
Bodies falling everywhere they tried arresting me for murder
Product of my environment nah this not the norm
Shows that sell out in a day lines around the block form
Competitors wanna diss but I’m a pray to God for em
Just landed from Stockholm dummy don’t get your spot stormed
Black Ops style my skin is thick like crocodile it’s lopsided
Like Kat Williams boxing verse a child plus I’m versatile
Was unknown they thirst for me now
And when it comes to chicks personally I like em wild
That’s a better fit cause what is a friend without the benefits?
Tell em to send a check I’m just warming up my pen a bit
What yall sweating is cute I deal with absolutes
Either it’s dope or it’s trash Ciroc or Absolute it’s taste
Cheddar talks chatter is waste don’t even judge just observe
Peep the pattern and wait often I felt out of place my barometer
Shakes around snakes and say the truth in Hypocrisy’s face
In this business of entertainment the majority’s fake
I had to navigate teach myself how to be great
I knew how to rhyme had to learn how to get cake
And this is for the record I had to set the record straight

[Hook: ProducHer Beats]
First they laugh then they throw shade
After that they doubt then they start to hate
Then they start to see all the moves that you make
Then everybody feel it then they really hatin’

[Verse 2: Napoleon Da Legend]
This ain’t the big mansion big car and money rap
But I find it funny that people don’t respect unless the money stack
So it shouldn’t surprise you to see me push a Mazzi
And dump this model just because she overcooked the broccoli
Someday they’ll write a book about me the story goes
Po came and rewrote history with his flow
Then he escaped from his exile enemies got x’ed out
Kicked my ex out for collab pull your checks out
On my next route who’s the next slouch to joust?
Ready to let out I’m a make it wet in a drought
Without a shadow of a doubt chicks straddle me on the couch
No babies kid I pull out and splash it in her mouth
I like it classic my brain’s being studied by Psychiatrics
When it comes to rap got the psyche of an addict
Nike Airmax I used to wear that and swear that I was the flyest
But for real to myself I was lying always saw myself as a lion
And aligning myself with only the stars like the belt of Orion
There was times where I felt I was dying but I survived
Contradictory my name is the Legend but I’m alive
Every thought has an inception and every rule has an exception
When you talk about the greatest never rule out the Legend
I just outgrew perfection that shit was getting old
We don’t speak the same language go cop Rosetta Stone
