Left, right, left
Left, right, left
Left, right, left
Alright...

Verse:
I'm twenty years young, guess that's twenty years dumb
Suckin' on that rum like it was my day job
I got payed like a slob
To lay in the shade while you pissed your lives away
I was livin' shit, truth talk no loss
But my neurons used to be a boss
Used to crash in the dirt, used to smash her in her skirt
Just a dame a dozen for what it's worth
Ya'll thought I fell off?
Well that was fuckin' stupid
Wasn't it? Now you back in love with cupid?
Retarded, but what the hell do I know?
You ain't got no independence in your high schools?
Neither did I, so why should I apologize
For the faculty and staff who fed me lies?
Kill people, burn trees, be cool
Be easy without the A's and you'll be paid
Is that what they telling you? Probably not
But it's the gospel, the scantron apostles
Seventeen years of my life gone, make you rather live in a fuckin' hostel
Still keep it real for the holograms
Who livin' off insta-fans, crampin' up they stance
But you'd never notice at the first glance
They impostors, I bleed true words
Never listen to they ramblings, all they dead verbs
Speaking of revolution with the JEM on my crest
I set a match to they world and burn it all for the rest

These are the poems I keep
Put them down to sleep

Hook:
Twenty years young
Twenty years young
Twenty years young
Twenty years dumb
