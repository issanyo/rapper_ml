[Hook: VerseBorn]

All i know
Is with or without this music
Ima make thangs pop
Because i have a family
To think about
So daddy can't be a slouch

[Verse 1: VerseBorn]

I took a look at my life
I wasn't impressed with it
Had to make a change
To this date that was the best vision

Can't reinvent the wheel
I ain't what the west missing
Im more one of the last pure
Remnants of what the west christened

Rep the best know spitting
So fresh so fitted
No migo flow
Im so west coast with it

Real in the flesh no
Stress No gimmicks
No limit - i got the hookup
So holla if ya hear me

Money route dipping
Solid ground no slipping
Out my circumference
If you ain't about the shit then

Lighting kush up in the blunt
Haters looking how we stunt
Player potnas pushing pedals
Heavy metal in the trunk

To everybody sleeping on me
Keep nodding off
Along with them critics it don’t
Affect me - not at all

Call it what you want
You feeling frogfish - nigga jump
6 figures and ain't even
Finish college like a chump

[Hook]

[Verse 2: VerseBorn]

Yall act and play parts
We actively partake and
Plan which
Continent to pop it off

I’m talking to pounds to a euro
Grounds to the aero-plane
Recalculate - its still a
Crown to a zero

So can check yaself
We busy Checkin in luggage
Hatin hungry niggas muffled
By the sounds of they stomach

But im good til the next meal
Mama how them jets feel?
Passports tatted
Extra baggage getting left here

They said i wouldn't make it
Prayed for me to fail
Now i make em hold they breath
Then charge em to exhale

Every unit boomin is The
Truest contribution To a
Fluid movement proving you and
Who is viewin's useless

But im breaking out the cave
Paving out a lane
Wit the top down full drive
Nothing in the way

Yet its something in a way
Cuz what i gotta say
Connects with minds in
Another countries let alone state
