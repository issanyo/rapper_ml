[Verse 1: XEROQ]
Uh It's the new, era new nigga
New clever rhymes make 'em dig a
Grave for the era
Flow ever fly like pigs in the sty
Til' I die in the Asian Porsche
My music in your mind like a trojan horse
They say that when i rhyme i keep changing course
Get ready for the schizophrenic bars
Ain't got plenty cars
In the past he attended mars
Only drive rented cars
Lips been chapped for a while man
So my bars plenty like Ireland
And you know my shit blizzard
Welcome to my land you can't meet the wizard
He only hang with the noose
Other than that
He a lonely recluse
Keeping the peace like a deuce
Or triggers
You know the flow float like sum niggers
Get your boat toked
While you choked on some figures
Know the boat coked
?

[Outro]
Hey Uh WOMBAT EP
Yall niggas Yall niggas
Ya Yall niggas ain't fucking with me
So fuck with the kid yall can't fuck with a G
