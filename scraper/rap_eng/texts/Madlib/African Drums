Verse 1 [Napoleon Da Legend]

We crept through the crevices bled thru a plethora of setbacks
My intellect is a heckler
This is the diamond era got my mind inside a barrel
Standing in the line of fire I’m the messiah pharaoh
Mamase Mamama kousa
I get the job done every time I slide through God
You in a Maserati spitting that Basura
I mastered the master key like Anuna
Who do you know? Nah fuck that, you don’t know
Cause when you confident and really got it you don’t show
These rappers rich but they broke it’s a slippery slope
Like that cliché in prison when you slip on the soap
Saying you dope, am I missing something is this a joke?
You got a ghost writer you ain’t wrote this? Nope
Atrocious y’all should both quit the pharaoh’s in motion
You can suck on my obelisk

Chorus [NDL] :
This the rhythm of the African drums
Street safaris gather massive sums
Respect the place where my acumen’s from
Fuck the 1 percent we put the masses in the front
Yo yo yo yo we put the masses in the front
Yo yo yo yo we put the masses in the front
Yo yo we gather massive funds and we live to the rhythm of the African drums

Verse 2 [Napoleon Da Legend]

Who got fans groupies that do wild things
My reach around the world’s longer than Luol Deng
This what I do all day I am who I may
The crowd cheering PharaohGamo Bomaye
Dude I’m made don’t worry about who I shade
I’m a shine till I’m recognized like 2pac’s name
I’m deep rooted got the fiends zooted
Life I breeze through it all that fake talk I see through it
Got the choppers walk like Mubutu in Kinshasa
Chasing Mufasas I’m a king like Shaka
Rare breed like a Chupacabra peep the saga
Palabras I speak rearrange each Chakra
Relocate to Lome for the slow pay
Stretched her fallopian up she got the bowed legs
Polly the oil with the OPEC gold threads below the neck
Presidents in my rolodex
Plant seeds to make the land green
And take back what’s mine like Mozambique
Commander in the chief I see what no man sees
Like trying to ball with Steph Curry with some old man knees
You forgot what you caught Amnes(ia)?
Have you ever in your life pursued something with no plan B?
No safety net/ you claim the throne is your home
Snatch kids out their cribs like ACS
