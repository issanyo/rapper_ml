[Intro]
Girls, all I really want is
Girls, and in the morning it's
Girls, and in the afternoon it's
Girls, cuz in the evening there's
Girls, everywhere there's
Girls, check this out

[Verse]
I like the way they walk
And it's chill to hear them talk
I can always make them smile
From LA to the Nile
You see back in the day there was this girl around the way
She liked my homeboy, M-A-D-L-I-B (Madlib)
He said he would not give it away
I asked him, "Please",  he said "You may"
You see her pants were tight and that's okay
'Cause she would dance and I would DJ
We took a long walk I think she was from the bay
I hope she'll say, "Hey, me and you should hit the hay"
I asked her out she said no way
I think that girl was gay (Damn, whatcha you do?)
So I broke off with no delay
I heard she moved real far away
That was two years ago this May
I seen that - just the other day
Jockin' MED to my dismay (Damn)

[Bridge]
You can't seem to settle down
Seems to be too many toys around
What you gonna do about the girl whose heart you're breaking

[Outro]
There's too many of them
Girls, to do the dishes
Girls, to clean up my room
Girls, to do the laundry
Girls, and in the bathroom
Girls, all I really want is
Girls, two at a time
Girls, with new wave hairdo I want those
Girls, I had to whip out my
Girls
