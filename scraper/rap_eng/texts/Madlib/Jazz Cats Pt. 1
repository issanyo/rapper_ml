Yo I be getting lit, sitting back listening to Sun Ra
Early George Benson on down to Hampton Hawes
Steve Kuhn, George Cables on the Fender Rhodes
Cedar Walton and Herbie Hancock drop the heavy load
Gene Harris and the Three Sounds for soul/jazz listeners
Bobby Hutcherson, Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers
Horace Silver (Bill Evans) to Terry Gibbs on the vibe
Gary Burton and album archives
Like Donald Byrd, George Duke and Lee Morgan
Shirley Scott, Groove Holmes and Jimmy Smith up on the organ
Gene Russell, the Art Ensemble of Chicago
Innovators like Michael White push out the Cal Tjader
Classic shit like Weather Report or Max Roach
Laid back like Freddie Hubbard trumpet notes
Cannonball Adderley, Eddie Harris, Milt Jackson
Like Ron Carter's basslines will beat you like a backspin

Yeah like a backspin, we got the jazz my man

Yo, who's got skills like Rahsaan Roland Kirk or conduct like William Fisher
Go to work with the swisher
Bumpin' John Coltrane up in my headphones
Gary Bartz, Mister Rub produce Lovetones
Even Kool and the Gang got jazz for that ass
Modern Jazz Quartet always got the A class
Johnny Hammond met Carl Saunders
Paul Bley, Thelonious Monk and Norman Connors
Albert Ayler, John Coltrane, McCoy Tyner
Dizzy Gillespie is presented by Don Sebesky
I be cranking mad jazz, got mad stacks of cool-out
You know we pull the smoke tool out
I give props to Bluenote and Black Jazz
Impulse, CTI records and Plusga
Verve to Milestone, Atlantic and Muse
There's plenty more that I could name but ya'll won't put them to use

Anyway, I love jazz my man
We got the jazz, we got the jazz my man
