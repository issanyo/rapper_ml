[Verse 1: Jack The Spitter]
Cheese stake at 1130
I know they heard me, i called em up, i'm wandering learning
Missing piece, i lost in the weeks these
Weed treats no longer give a release
And now i'm sitting stupid with a beat or two
So you can hang with me if you do doobs
Choo chop, with my crew, from the pews boo
We so high blow the floor through the damn roof
Killed a track like it's nothing like "pew pew"
And i ain't never died but i'd like to
Empathy is never an issue because i've lived a million times
Maybe twice where I knew you
And all i knew about love was in these toons
My vibe gone but my buzz came up when yo hips do
So baby i'ma lay it down like the wake do
Cuz when i'm gone, ima take you
You said you liked where my hair part
I mean it wash;t much but it's a damn start
Dare i say more, when i imply
We were fine till the day i realized it was my damn fault?
And i'm sorry that i let it get to my brain
The game was nothing to see your face again
If i could take it back, have the same day
I probably wouldn't, i'd let the bullet cause the most pain
And is it fair to say i miss you when you can't change
I don't deserve you, i mean it, ever damn phrase
But it's the best that we go our own damn ways
I don't pray, but god knows how my days changed
When you gone, left the pain eh?
You not saw, why you wanna play this damn game?
But i'm fine kush nugget in my brain faded
Off the same ye, I just wanna say

[Bridge: Jack The Spitter]
I don't miss us i just miss you
Wanna do the things we ain't got the time to
I wanna say love, but that include u
So ima fucking quit life if i have to
Die lie in the dirt, where your shoes been
Worship the ground you walk, i ain't pretend
I'd literally bow to the shrine in your name
But now i just burn memories that remain, with my brain

[Hook]
Burn it all burn it all
Burn it all burn it all
Burn it all burn it all
I ain't lie i ain't lie i need to burn it all

[Verse 2: Jakob]
I miss your name
More than I miss self harm
I'm not gonna say shit get
Hit off weed is the bomb
Not causing alarm but I
Just want to inform that what
You are now is being taken to far
I miss the good times
Now your stuck in the fake
Whatever happened to the times
Sleep in til noon, wake and bake?
Raking up the tears that you
Left on my plate and I'm eating
Up steak can't you see whats at
Stake when the past is a memory
But my past was a gun
No fun in my lifetime, you get
Everything you want, whine
And cry about shit are you real?
Maybe then when you look at me
Now then you'll know how I feel
And those times were surreal
The type of girl I kill, for body
At the floor reaching for the fate
Of god but no one is preaching
Give me love bites, called leaching
Like blood veins faded into my skin
What you're asking is masking
On what had happened when
We're feasting off the future at last
Cause what is now dead
Was now left in the past
And I laugh

[Bridge: Jack The Spitter]
I don't miss us i just miss you
Wanna do the things we ain't got the time to
I wanna say love, but that include u
So ima fucking quit life if i have to
Die lie in the dirt, where your shoes been
Worship the ground you walk, i ain't pretend
I'd literally bow to the shrine in your name
But now i just burn memories that remain, with my brain

[Hook]
Burn it all burn it all
Burn it all burn it all
Burn it all burn it all
I ain't lie i ain't lie i need to burn it all
