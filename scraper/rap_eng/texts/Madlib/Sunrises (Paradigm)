Skimming through the complex
Thinking how easy to be put in a complex
In all facets

It don't matter

I get shit shooting like dragnet
The motion picture
Living movement of this soundtrack

Cause this source material
Need a contract
With no contacts
The way I see it

Stay popping
And focused on the goal
With all context

Knowing all
The nuances
And the principles
To run this fucking school
Like a principal
And my assessment
Most niggas
Copy Other niggas like they tracing sketches

Now check this
Uniqueness
Coming through the speakers

Peering out the window
When I wake I'm looking eastern

Waiting for the leavening
Rising to occasions
Like I'm standing in
But really standing out

Cause someone like norm
Has prolly never been
Unless they were akin to him
Or kin to him

Now I'm shiftin rap again
I'm back for the first time
Ludicrously spittin other shit

Not trying to DTP
But I'll DDT
Like RVD

Bending backwards
But never compromising
On the intricately
Descriptive
Form of telling people
That I'm not the norm
And never will
Submit
To the bullshit
We living in

Got you half torn
Cause you don't follow molds
But you have to fuck with norms
Cause that's how you get along
Ain't that how a country formed?

"Well damn bro
What you even thinking on"

That my name has always been norm

And it's a damn shame
Oldest sounded name

But ain't it fucking funny
How I'm bringing on a new wave
