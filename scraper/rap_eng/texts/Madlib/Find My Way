[Verse 1: Dskillz]
If there's a will, there's a way
I'm just trynna find mine
The Rhymes that I relay, display, that I'm in my prime
Destined to Be, Just like Ali, The Greatest Of All Time
You Should Go For Yours, Cause I'm Going For Mine
And I Ain't Holdin' Nothin' Back
Cutting slack for nobody
Yea, I'm killing tracks and talking more smack
Than Yo Gotti
So, How You Want It, We Got It
Beatdowns for Cheap Clowns like Rodney Got It
So What's mine is mine, and what's yours is mine
So, If I'mma Shine, then it's by my design
And Through my ambition, my mission is to wreck a compisition
As I rise in my division
So, let me put it blatantly
It's time that I came out the gate, cause fate said there's a vacancy
Of Real Mc's in the vacinity
Or at least there used to be
If Hip Hop is dead
Than nobody read the eulogy
Ya'll Should Get Used To Me
