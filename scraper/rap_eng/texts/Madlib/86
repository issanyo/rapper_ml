Dripping off the meat grinder
Need to find a freak
Find a beat so I can tie it neat
And clutch it like The Iron Sheik
Crush it with my lion's teeth
If not that's fine for me
Cause I am beat
So goddamn paranoid I only need one eye to sleep
Slow it down a bit so it can start to set
And make it easy for you to understand the tech
I'm a killer plain and simple
A skull is my sigil
Always trying to belittle
Reap the spirit with the sickle
Check the penmanship
I'm ending shit
A+ rhetoric
You fiend to get with this like Illuminati memberships
Ain't even the best, I stash the better verses
Chock full of lines that even make the Lord nervous
Flow's fancy like all cursive
Laying down scripture with the Hebrews
Genius is what he brews
A blessing to witness everything that I've seen
No transgressions to my style it's just that clean
No second guessing now did you get the lesson
That I'm heavily stressing
If not then you're a lemming
Moving onto greener pastures
While you deal with meaner bastards
I conceal the evil mask and then reveal the genius patent
So sad how I give these lyrical gems free
Don't even write now I just type, digital MC
Immune to your poison like a Redguard
So I casually jet off
While you're stuck in traffic like a Czech broad
Don't guess answers without knowing the sum
But if you want it then I'll flaunt it as I descend from the sun
That's how it's done
One
