[Sample]
I know this is the end
So I'm asking
Where are my friends?
I know that this love has come to an end
But why did I have to listen to my friends

It was only yesterday

[Instrumental]

[Sample]
There comes a time
In everyone's life
When you have to fall in love
Once or twice

Ready to kick your ass outta the world
