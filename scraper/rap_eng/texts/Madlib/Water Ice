I'm in the mood for some water ice
Philly Flav's on Sundays was always nice
On the way home saying "I should've bought a pint"
In my mind I'm lying denying I got a vice
This music's for barbecues and two stepping
Good food with the crew and some old school selections
Dominating in spades and yelling "who's next?" when
Others stay from the table to keep the mood festive
We'd sacrifice for one another
Met up with PB&J once to stay under budget
Philly Summers, philadelphia in abundance
The fellowship was hella rich, it's us who wasn't
Through the bliss I see our ignorance
We tend to forget that stuff when we reminisce
Nostalgia means the past comes in a different tint
So I enjoy it with no plans of reliving it
But I'm always down for Philly Flav's
Black raspberry and strawberry lemonade
Make mine a gelato though I'll regret it later
Before that I'll go to the corner to get a steak
I'm not the typical "wiz wit"
These days I be getting bacon with chicken
American cheese, hot sauce and sweet peppers
Salt, pepper, oregano, I don't need ketchup
The 'itis got me yawnin'
Can we afford Sabrina's in the morning?
You know that stuffed french toast is my jawn fam
Adding syrup would be absurd, I'm goin in
West Oak Lane still had the Jazz Fest then
Roy Ayers, Chrisette Michelle and Brass Heaven
The Art Museum after 5 on Fridays
All of them cheap or free, still a fly date
We might take a ride through Kelly Drive
South Street in the evening, sweet potato fries
Some where there's a stereo playing "Summertime"
Temple radio jazz created such a vibe
I just wish you could get a taste of it
The many flavors of Philly making the saints covet
The fellowship, the food I can't separate from it
The bad calories and the healthy debates of it
All of it made me who I became since
I got a lot of regrets but wouldn't change it
Demonstrations answering "how's The Faith lived?"
And i gained weight but the wife appreciates it
Can I show Him off? Imago
While we out just doing life, as I go
Let the one another's invite folks
Into the process of being discipled
