[Intro: Declaime]
Take this how you have to
Or don’t take it at all
Our time is growing small
The writings on the wall

Take this how you have to
Or don’t take it at all
Our time is growing small
The writings on the wall

Take this how you have to
Or don’t take it at all
Our time is growing small
The writings on the wall

[Verse I: Oh No]
It’s the next termination
Let’s go
Raise the price like petrol
Take you down, back like retro clothes
Tag you like Marc Eckos
Debut in the game console
But this ain’t a game
Calm yourself down
And honor the motherfucking vet though
I been kept low
But now I’m out like escrow
And yall don’t get jumped
Yall get quantum leaped
That’s an out of body experience
Faking peoples they is not
Shape
I am in tip top
These phonies
That’s what yall niggas call hip-hop?
Then I’m gonna change it to hop hips
They hold on the heat hot
And then they get fucked like loose lips
That’s over and over again, yo fuck this
This shit is played out like some porno shit
Its like every other city I go
I see some new niggas walking
Same nigga Oh on some swishers and the cash flow
More blunts, more games
More dames, more dimes
More courts than signs
We don’t play
Get smoked like the chronic
Ate from the Cali state of mind
I gots to get mines anyway
Back down, Oh's background with Madlib
The new sound plus Cali wild and that’s it
Blaw

[Hook: Oh No]
Please believe me
We do it easy
Hip hop it needs me
I want it back (back, back, back, back)
I want it back
Please believe me
We do it easy
Hip hop it needs me
I want it back (back, back, back, back)
I want it back

[Verse II: Oh No]
Uh
Theoretically speaking
It was stoled and duplicated
But the new generations don’t know the old
Only a few, I raised off the realest
They had them chains back then
But didn’t talk about it in every sentence
And that’s when them songs had meaning
Either it was that
Or it was raw ridiculous deliveries that would resolve fiending
Nowadays, the odds a million to one
Still cold chillin’ like ‘88
Fast forward to ‘91
’92 I learned that it was Hard to Earn
So I midnight marauded me some mics
‘Til I passed out at my mom’s work
Mad LPs got jerked
But that don’t stop the hustle
Still got a lot of work to tussle
Shows ain't packed for the vets, disgusted
Fans mad ‘cause it ain't
Packed enough to get  more people to bumpin’
’96 again we started disruption
2006 the world got more corrupted
And ain't nobody saying nothing

[Hook: Oh No]
Please believe me
We do it easy
Hip hop it needs me
I want it back (back, back, back, back)
I want it back

Please believe me
We do it easy
Hip hop it needs me
I want it back (back, back, back, back)
I want it back
