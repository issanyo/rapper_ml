[Verse 1]
How come day breaking don't fall?
And night falling don't break?

They don't like to lose
Like when whose telling who
They don't like and learn
Like I said
(They never knew that)
Feel like a Lieutenant that would be too nice
Roll without pain
I guess I paid those dues
(Ya'll do)
Anyway
(Anyhow they're always sayin')
'cause I know
(What will be will be)

[Hook / Instrumental with Samples]
(Anyhow, don't let your Vodka get lonesome this ???)
(Anyhow, what can you do anyway?)
(Anyhow, like they always say; 'What will be, will be')
(Anyhow, finish your Margarita)
(Anyhow, what can you do anyway?)
(Huh? I've been down that road a couple of times too)
(Anyhow, like they always say; 'What will be, will be')

[Verse 2]
How come day breaking don't fall?
And night falling don't break?
(Anyhow)
What's the prettiest thing you've ever seen?
Black on Black?
White on White?
Green on Green?

Chicks, off lovin' round 3 in the morning
(I know)
The sun pushing down
Making things grow
(I know)
The silence in the dawn
When the car goes past
(Talking about the dawn)
(It's about that time y'know)
(It was about that time a couple of hours ago)

[Hook / Instrumental with Samples]
(Say how...What can you do anyway?)
(Like the man said, 'what will be will be')
('bout the only time he ever told the truth too)
('bout the only time the man spoke without false tongue anyway)
(right?)
(Anyhow, what you doin' here anyway?)
