[1st Verse - Y.S.A] Candle Lights apart of the dinner plans
Uploading photos up on the Instagram
I'm dressed smooth for the occasion
Opposite of my dirty denim and timberlands
Wherever we dine, WE
Catch all the eyes
Of all the people in the spot
Like I'm screaming with a Glock
My, talk is slicker than any Genius with a bop
Women beg for me like crackheads, screaming for the crack rock
I got her scheming for the cock
She be telling the deepest secrets to my crutch
She repeat it non stop
Bop, occasional gags
Foot slamming on the gas
Got Dammit I'm a crash
Supplying hits
I'm a king like a Lions Wit
You want peace but can't shake hands clutching a iron FIST
I insist
I keep it real cuz these wild cats, tell u a bunch of CRAP, like Lion sh*t
I never stand to lose
My Dash Snow complex, I never try to Obey
Or understand the rules
I overstand the outlandish views
But Dub-C told me, it ain't what they call you its what you answer to
Yeah, I'm on Top of the Line
I F*CKED UP.... SH*T!


[2nd Verse - Fred Pizz] I Gotchu brother... unh!
These cats thinking they can play me like a fiddle, F that!
I heard ya tracks was wack and that's that
I took the beat,I had to switch it up a little
J-Lin, took a step back and drove it down the middle UNH!
Kick up dust, I'm swaggin in my Chocos
Young Jeans, Kelly and J's, I'll step on yo neck
Know that I'm different, Persona very Similar
Truth with contradiction of lies, is perpendicular
Non-Fic man, I gotta make an advertisement
Jumpoff, they looking at a ni**a like he isnt trying
But my homie tolfd me go hard with ya mixtape, you miss 100% of the shots that you DON't TAKE
Ball so hard, LeBron on you maf*ckers
Kareem, Abdul, Jabur up on you maf*ckers
Smooth fade, black top like the back courts
Love for the game, shots kissing off the backboard.... AW!!
