[Chorus: Karriem Riggins]
We made it through
Single mothers, locked fathers
Torn families, East-West rivalries
Hip-hop, jazz music
Thanksgiving
The best time for family
Crack pipes, dirty needles
The government, lying to the people
Live mics, sturdy needles
The main ingredient fro rocking my people
(Repeat)

[Verse 1: Karriem Riggins]
Its time we get back to the youth
Put words together shed light in the booth
While stabbing it in and stabbing it out
Sometimes the best way ins the only way out
Hip-hop is sick we need the rap vitamin
I'm venting through the track
So we can see the light again
Dark tunnel, soul music prevail
Prevail
And we will
