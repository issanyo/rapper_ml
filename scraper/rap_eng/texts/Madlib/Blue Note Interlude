Blue Note
Alfred Lion and Frank Wolff

Alfred Lion and Francis Wolff
Two German immigrants who founded a jazz record company in 1939
That became very famous in its genre
Unlike any other jazz label
Blue Note Records influenced the evolution of music in sound, style, and technical standards
Each of the Blue Note recording sessions was documented by the photographs of Francis Wolff
Alfred Lion's vision of music and Francis Wolf's clear view of the recording sessions
Are a legacy of the uniquely creative achievement that continues to this very day
