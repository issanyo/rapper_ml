Strawberry fields, I want I want I want
Strawberry Sunsets, Strawberry Incense

{Verse 1}
I write rhymes in this lifetime
Hope the light shines on the right minds
Despite crimes, that can offend ya
I rise high, and I fight lies, thats my agenda
Ya white eyes are quite blind
The ignorance ya'll suffer from is pint size
I wanna help ya'll see the sun at night time
And when you see it don't mistake it for the moon either
Cocaine and popping pills I do neither
But I do reefer ,yeah I blow trees up
Dimethyltryptamine for the cold season
Winter this ain't nothin for you beginners
Open your third eye, kill off the Ten Percenters
In my mother's placenta
I knew what I was sent fa
Become a young griot, magnificent huh
It's feels like 08, I got my confidence back
Regain my old ways, I was kind of relaxed
Lossed my steam, thinking will I ever succeed
Where these A&Rs def and these labels are thieves
Skin color black so I was labeled a thief
That's why being patriotic just's a fable to me
On Crenshaw and 43rd tryna sell my 43rd
Mixtape for the week, this tape for the weak
Who need strength from the strong minded
My songs' timeless
This feel like marijuana with a long island
Out in Beru, you know who I am
Young Heru
Known as the Sun god but I'm god's son, they built monuments for Out in Peru
From Giza to Machu Picchu, I greet you, from the pyramids apex
This another year I'm bout to make another statement
Future of the west, soon to be your favorite
They say my competitions' Top Dawg Entertainment
But I am the Top Dawg of this entertainment shit
I'm LA Reid but mo' equipped
That time when I met Kendrick in 2010 and
I said brethren, respect your talent and your messsage
The homie Tremeal said I wanna colloborate
I said pause my nigga just wanna congratulate
Keep doing your thang, I'll see you in the future
So Ima' keep it pushin
I shook his hands then he told me nigga good lookin
"(my nigga good lookin)"
'Cause if you speakin' that real shit you ain't my enemy in combat
But my comrade
But if you diss me my nigga it's all bad
I cut the ties quick, suit ya'self
Go head shoot ya'self
I'll fuck ya main bitch while you underground livin
Hold up I'm trippin, Hold I'm trippin

{Verse 2}
I couldn't get a beat from Madlib, so I manage
To find a beat by Madlib
Surfin the web this sound sweet, I grabbed it
Bumping my head, than I went beast, the maddest
While ya'll debatin whether he got off
I'm bumpin Marvin Gaye smokin on that Peter Tosh
I read alot, flipping through pages of Matthews
And Revelations reveals the fate of Samuel
Not Adams but uncle
It's Sammy's last days in the jungle
Momma says god loves you, it's a beautiful struggle
And bein' poor can make an arrogant man humble
Momma says' god loves you
(god loves you baby)

The hunger, the hunger, the hunger, the hunger
Say it four times, I foresee forever green
Inspiring a nation like Katniss Everdeen
Post-apocalyptic , but Cobes is optimistic
While most are not specific
My flows are quite explicit
Leaders of the past, we salute and honor
But it's a new day get ready for Futurama
A futuristic black star like I shoot for Ghana
So many fish in the sea, but I'm the new piranha
A do or die-r, a mothafuckin stupid rhymer
When the songs done, I hope that I'm the one that you admire
Ya' admiration deserves a standing ovation
You became a fan at the right time, witness the transformation
My destination ain't Young Money no no no no
Bad Boy or MMG no no no no
Not yet allow me to progress
This indie route is promised
These deals are bondage
I wanna be a freeman like Morgan, Riley and Huey
When the writin' gets too deep
I take breath reflect than keep it movin'
A rapper, singer, artist, musician
With new precision
Not a multi-instrumentalist yet, but that soon will hit him
My ambitions for riches makes your ambitions for mentions
Make you look dumb and demented
I'm on another dimension
Mo' hungry then 30 kids in an Ethiopian village
Eating United Nations genetic modified chicken
Now they suffer from sickness
That shit that made me a victim
A victimized criminal oxymoronic nigga
Yeah, just pass me the chronic would ya
Yeah, just pass me the chronic would ya
And while you're over there pass that strawberry incense
It ain't gon take long I'ma be there in a minute

(Outro)
