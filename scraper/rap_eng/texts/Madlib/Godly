[Verse 1: Swami Netero]
My rhymes is catastrophic
I'll leave you catatonic/
Over toilets about to vomit
After these infernal sonnets/
That there's a promise
I'm the hottest rhymer ever born/
Leaving rappers scorned
After stepping to The Overlord/
Got them jumping overboard
The second I approach/
Lames is bleeding out they nose
Like they ran into a pole/
Killing all my foes
With a lyrical incision/
'Cause Swami's the definition
Of a Hip Hop musician/

[Verse 2: Swami Netero]
This here's
Your eulogy/
For trying to make a fool of me
With all of that garrulity/
You'll lack
Salubrity/
From lexical acuity
And negative fortuity/
I'll kill you neurally
With proverbs and soundwaves/
That creep inside your crown cave
And leave you on the ground dazed/
Man, that's an outrage
That you would want to see me/
I'm from another species
That thrives off eating weaklings/

[Verse 3: Swami Netero]
I'm far beyond
Your comprehension/
I'll start a sentence with no retention
And cause you to bleed out of your orifices/
From another dimension
You might need an extension/
'Cause the rhymes that I'm spitting
Just might dissolve an appendage/
Posses no apprehension
And if you have a minute/
I'll cause a mental collision
With verbal calisthenics/
Gon' need an intervention
'cause when I'm in attendance/
My rhymes will pull out your tendons
Like they're retarded dentists/
Your writtens need revision
I'm spitting Xannie bars/
You faggots can't recall
After I exhaust your gall/
My bars are off the wall
I got the gods appalled/
I'll cause a lame to ball
Cry inside a bathroom stall/
I'm cold as Montreal
An hotter than wasabi/
These haters trying to jock me
Gayer than Illuminati/
And don't you try an stop me
I'll flip and catch a body/
The rhymes I spit are godly
I ain't even being cocky/
