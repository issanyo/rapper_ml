(Chorus)
Let's kill it
Let's kill it..
[Grip the stereo in an instant
And then I twist up a bud light an incense] And I'mma feed ya rhymes X5
[Bump the Boom Music 'cuz I found a fat L nine times out of ten I use it to start this way]

(Verse 1)
Hola, flow supernova
Grip the mic stand to jam and pose but no Hova
I told ya, Mutombo bows thrown at ya dome bruh
I’m flown up, hoes suckin boners hope to blow up
No luck for those such, CHEERS!
Here’s a toast to those sluts who take it in the back like a tow truck
I’m Zenvo gold clutch, you chrome rust, antonym robust
Doing donuts, eating a donut, feedin' cold cuts
You must not know much
That's how you earn no trust, and no lust
Be a gentleman then watch her toe touch
Then you'll know what's goody
Only problem: wakin up the next morning with no hoodie bro

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
As I’m walkin down liberty ave
With a backpack full of class notes
I’m spazzin to Rass Kass quotes
Fact so, natural rap addict, a black folk
Half though, with a daft flow, I’m bagging trash hoes
Y’all whacker than a bat, I adapt with attack blows
A craft, no mac, niggas cheese, cheddar jack
So I grab the shredder, slash em in tad’s for my ta-co’s
Eat it, relax, sit back until I gotta crap though
Now that is foul no free throws, hacking negroes
I’m in beast mode, crossin cats til they knees broke
Defeat whole squadron's, please show listo
‘Fore end you end up in carnage;
Reach a half dozen feet below

Don't wanna reach a half dozen feet!
