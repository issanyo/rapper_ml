[Napoleon Da Legend verse 1]
Assertive, committed murder over the beat surface
Rocking T shirts over the years you seen my words flourish
Like my discography discovery my mythology
Encourage you to steal it keep ya dollars ain’t no cover fee
It’s on me tonight, open bar, tip the bartender my life changed
That day I hit up the guitar center
Bought me the pro tools a 103 TLM
And got on a 24 hour cycle like CNN
Fox News and MSNBC back in DC like
"I need to move out of this city, think I see the light"
Stuck in my ways I had to Feng Shuey, drunk state
Out here I can’t excel that’s a cheap Hyundai
20 years in DC was a week in New York
Meeting my hero’s in the flesh they ain’t the people you thought
And yo they fucked up and twisted like me, I’m motivated more
Snoop said "to be the boss you gotta pay the cost"

[Napoleon Da Legend Chorus x2]
1 shot for Madlib 2 shots for Dilla
Peace to Big L and 2Pac, he was the realest
3 for the heads that bop when the beats dopes
And 4 for the hustlers who set and reach they goals

[Napoleon Da Legend verse 2]
I don’t mind the birds these bombs is time deferred
I’m a cross between Ip Man and Heisenberg
Iron Mike Tys', twice superb
And No!
We don’t sound alike, I rhyme with different of type of words
I might stir controverse inside this universe
Tackle uncertain times my attitude is super sure
Weather storms stronger than Jupiter’s mingle with the unscrupulous the same people rumored to have ruined this
Passed the meme watching and gotcha gotcha
That classic, Frank Sinatra
Submarines Tanks and choppers
I got to war with class, and switch the format
Smash the phonograph in half I’m on a war path
That rebel INS, I level up and get fresh I’m next to none
I get the bread you keep the excess
And now I got em apologizing on they dead bed
And I accept it I ain’t even mad that shit dead yo

[Napoleon Da Legend Chorus x2]
1 shot for Madlib 2 shots for Dilla
Peace to Big L and 2Pac / he was the realest
3 for the heads that bop when the beats dopes
And 4 for the hustlers who set and reach they goals

[Napoleon Da Legend verse 3]
Black like tar like the plight of avatars
Black like the black light shine black like a star
Black like the streets at night Black like dreadlocks
Black like afterlife the aftermath of a headshot
Black like the passion of Christ and absence of light
Black like my fashion is right
Black like
Damn man, that fucked me up man
You actually right
Black
