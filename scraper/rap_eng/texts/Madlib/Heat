I'm buzzing, who gives a shit? (lol)

[Verse 1]
Aiyyo these niggas keep rollin like cars are stolen
Holding heat, folding meat to the back of your head
The whole world sleeps
While we dropping beats and lyrics, our own techniques
Suckas standing mad in the back, cause they don't get freaks
Some of these rappers look like they got high heels on
Lipstick and makeup, laced-up thong
We keep it raw like sex with baby moms
Madlib, Talib getting the gravy on
Shit's kinda refreshing like bottles of Evian
Don't even know what day we on
24 hours a day hittin the hazy bong
(Heat) The raw addict, (Heat) dropping static
(Heat) Changing - Changing the sound (Heat)
When it goes around addict drop static like James Brown
It goes around - round and round...

[Chorus]
HEAT (Turn it up) HEAT (Turn it up) x 8

[Verse 2]
Coming through with my niggas like we own the city
And dropping nitty gritty while you niggas coming shitty
(Doing it right) with a chick while she looking pretty
Niggas mad since I'm in the hitting kitten committee
Sipping on the henny checking out the beat blast
My nigga Med roll the blunt with a twist of hash
Like a drug dealer all I want to see is cash
(Nah, don't do me no favors, all I wanna see is my cash)
Keep the heat locked even when the beat knock
Leave a deep shock, make a nigga sleepwalk
Out to lunch, Madlib hit like a championship punch
To the head, speakers smashed to the red, leaving ash
Getting cake up, nigga better wake up
(nigga say what?) Ya'll niggas better wake up
Get your weight ups with the dollar bench press
Take your one step while I take my ten steps

[Chorus]
