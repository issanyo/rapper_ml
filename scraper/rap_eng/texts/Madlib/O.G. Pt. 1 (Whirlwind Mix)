[Verse I]
This flower is highly scented
Push your whip off the cliff with your body in it
The brown man still fight for our lands
So don't tell me bout your soundscan, nigga
Impeach the president, beats are evidence
I won't stop till we seen on Letterman
Passion so high, see it in my eyes
Stop me over your dead body? Well, nigga, bye
A thousand bucks will make the eagle scream
And design is like the Einstein of wine
Don't stop, won't stop till I'm first
And I bless you with a verse so evil it's cursed
It hurts to see my nigga backseat the herase
I'm so high, smoke the piece of the earth
Madlib put me in a place most producers can't
"A's a king", you should chant
Everybody wanna know who the champ
Kid not I be, hip hop Ali

My ressurection is destined
Crowned king of the underground with a dirty infection

Now understand where I'm coming from
You think I'm pointing at the sky
I'm showing you I'm number one
Rapping like Rambo, you ain't Stallone
You ain't gotta be the president to get your face on the stone
I zone my blackberry phone works in Rome
Among the stars, God, Earth is home
Thirst to own, I'm feindin for the top
Came for that spotlight, I'm coming for that spot
Chicken noodle soup shots at your dudes
Now he's gone like the top on the coupe
That slick talk, big walk, nigga better get lost
So hot I write my rhymes with a pitchfork
I'm not the antichrist, but damn he nice
Speak so well they think my family white
The nigga you'll never see on grammy night
And the winner is...A - naw this can't be right
I write checks, write death with the same hand
You dry snitchin?
We about the rain dance
From the same place, we all had the same chance
You can't see the target but my aim enhanced
It's the same in London, it's the same in france
So it's the same in Japan they say A is the man
