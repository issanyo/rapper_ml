(Verse)
Got no mass appeal but still got massive skill
Master ill, they know that I rap surreal
Rap circles around your top 5 most beloved rappers
Can do it running backwards, eyes closed while I rhyme flows
Leave they mind blown, and as a matter of fact
Run laps like Danica Patrick with a panic attack
Inside the back of a Cadillac
Drop lines like cartel, where's my platinum plaque at?
Rapping is Baghdad, Napalm Nagasaki dropping
Keep the block as hot as nollie popping
Olly oxen rappers out they spot at the top floor
Chamberlain with the scoring, stop watching the box score
An outlaw over the breaks of the beat
And embracing the heat, it's just aim and release for me
It's like packing 3 9's in '93
Since '99, been on a beats, rhyming crime spree
Senile/see now, I probably send shots subliminal
But just remember your desktop is digital
I advise y'all to invest not in kicking flows
Ain't synonymous as dreadlocks and criminals
Lyrical, known to spit relentless
Drop bombs the defense is a Smith-N-Wesson
No safety, hand it off like a misdirection
Leave niggas in a box like gifts and presents
Uh, that's a last resort
Don't join if you wack, this a passion sport
Better cash support me like a sad divorce
Been spitting all this fire, don't pass the torch to me
The problem is me and my conglomerate
Been the illest to step foot on the continent
Just know this a don you with, my nines'll spit
And niggas lose consciousness

(Outro)
Ain't nobody stopping him
The illest on the continent
Probably spit that wonderama shit
Just me and my conglomerate
