[Verse 1]
Wonder if you let me put my hands on your body
Wonder if you let me ride when I’m feeling naughty
I just wanna make love while we listening to Party
Nobody can here us because next door is a party
We can grab a tea because you know that I’m UK
I don’t even drink but we can get little juicy
Your name is Simon I do whatever you say
I’m feeling drunk in love that’s word to Beyonce

[Pre-Chorus]
I call you your highness I can be your queen
I get you up baby you know what I mean
But you got me here singing like Alicia Keys
I’m digging you but you don’t know me
You don’t know me
You don’t know my name mm

[Chorus]
Baby could you take to me one time
Talk to me one time
Talk to me one time woah

I’m wishing you could talk to me one time
Talk to me one time
Talk to me one time woah

[Verse 2]
I’m hoping that you see the DM I sent you on twitter
Dropping you my number please don’t throw it in the litter
Even changed my pic so that you could see my figure
If you get to know me you’ll see that my heart is bigger
Bought a new bikini hoping we could take a vacay
Hope you hit it last, Kanye not Ray J
You in the West but shorty just swing my way
I’m feeling drunk in love that’s word to Beyonce

I call you your highness I can be your queen
I get you up baby you know what I mean
But you got me here singing like Alicia Keys
I’m digging you but you don’t know me
You don’t know me
You don’t know my name woah

[Chorus]
Baby could you take to me one time
Talk to me one time
Talk to me one time woah

I’m wishing you could talk to me one time
Talk to me one time
Talk to me one time woah

[Outro]
But you don’t know my name
You don’t know my name

Feels like you
You don’t know my name
Feels like you
You don’t know my name
