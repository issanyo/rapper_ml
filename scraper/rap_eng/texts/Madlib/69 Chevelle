[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shout outs to Madlib
It's Jake Ellz
What up, look

[Verse 1]
I wasn't expected to put on like this in the first place
So worst case scenario, Ellz end up in first place
Third race tape, checkered flag at the drive though
Double cheese on my burger with cheese on my fries too
Mango bape on me cause orange is the new black
Mob bitches surround my table, no halo my homies lay low
Pay off for time done, time off, time to rethink things
Vinyls of the Bee Gees, peace treaties with weed leaves, see
Scratch with hatchets like my jockey packin' cleavers
Fuck boys dependent on the pussy, leavin' it to beaver
Claimed deceiver, lord of the ringers
Popped a token and played some blue grass
Too bad that lap dance wasn't any cheaper

[Interlude]
God damn, yo (god damn)
Yo I spent two hundred dollars at the strip club in one weekend cuz
It was crazy, but I can't complain when I, when I, uh

[Verse 2]
Race a 69 Chevelle through the reservoir
No bars hold, what the fuck i need a metaphor?
Explore my situation, you must be playin'
My patience is runnin' thinner
Rookie Bruce Willies, killin' beginners
Do it throughout the winter, spittin' bundles of splinters
Kindlin' for the fire, skydive inside of your sister
Kiss her neck before she return it directly after the dutch
Pink bunny, white rabbit cause I smoke too much
Special herbs and Quasimoto my dolo positive package
Compete with this pistol pete and you best to reserve your rations
American beauty pageant cause a midlife crisis
Milf claimin' they into youngins but only for tonight, shit
I could do you right miss, just turn off the lights quick
Eat outta your pussy, no need for a fork and knife
Shift your body to the edge of the bed, I could throw it backwards
Get a view of that pretty behind while puffin' the Backwood

[Outro]
You know it's that good
I'm winkin' at you through the microphone baby, I see you out here
God damn
