(MF Doom as Viktor Vaughn)
I knew you was effin' around
Playing all innocent hoing since the foundation
Don't make have to pound his tin crown face in
And risk being jammed up like traffic inbound from space in
There's been a place for you in my heart since we first met
A teenage love that didn't feel no hurt yet
My boys warned me you was poison like BBD first cassette
And still I put my chips on the worst bet
Gave up the skirt, now I gotta hear it from the street
How dare you drag my name in the dirt and cheat
You coulda broke it off, ended it, dipped
And if you spoke soft you coulda still preserved the friendship
Now you apologize that's what they all say
You wasn't sorry when you sucked him off in the hallway
But have it your way, raw no foreplay
That's you if you want a dude who wear a mask all day
And just to think I used to be proud of you
And you had some real good power

Probably kissed me later that evening I should be hurling
Matta fact, gimme back my bracelet and my sterling
I rather waste it or give it to ya girlfriend
She did let me stab it last week while you was working
Remember our vacation out to Maryland?
I dooked the maid Carolyn
She made me throw the towel in
Like all foul men the time I hit ya moms off
I told her knock it off
But she had to set the rocket off
Ain't enough room in this fckin' town
When you see tin head
Tell 'em be duckin' down
I'm not rompin' around
He better be ready and prepared
To be stomped in the ground
