[Intro]
(1, 2, in the place to be here to see most definitely it's...)
Yeah, J Dilla y'all

Come on

Uh-huh

[Verse 1: J Dilla]
Holla!
Get it, Poppin' of from the bottles to the collars
Clap hands, nigga, get live with your mans nigga
It's thee official..hands in the air let me see them wrist glow
Turn me up another notch in your system
You say you want the hot shit then listen
Madlib...and Jay Deezy
Doin' it like we doing it for tv
And you don't wanna change the dial
World premier niggas rearrange your styles
Should have never been allowed in the game
All y'all fake gangsters out
We shut it down like the enemy
I know all my real niggas feeling me

[Chorus]
Official, official, official, official
It's thee official, official official official
It's thee official, official official official
Thee official, official official official

(Yo where y'all at? We bringing it to the hood y'all)

Turn it up
Official, official, official, official

[Verse 2: J Dilla]
Ok
Out we the old and in with the new shit
Quick to tighten the faces
Of niggas who catch cases of loose lips
Shut tit up...shut tit up!
Or see some real live nigga nuttin' up!
And I don't be around the way
Like I used to I don't have time these days
I keeping busy making power moves
I don't fuck wit them coward dudes
I keeps it bouncing when the P.I's wanna
Wish for death, Im C. Bronson
It's whatever its however you l
Think a nigga trying to move ahead of you then you right
We gon' take this back, nigga
You already know, Jay spit that

[Chorus]
Official, official, official, official
It's thee official, official official official
It's thee official, official official official
Thee official, official official official

Hut, hut 2, hut 3
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut
