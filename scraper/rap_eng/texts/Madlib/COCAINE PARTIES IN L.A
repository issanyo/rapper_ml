[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Hey Killa, you forgot your soda dawg
My mama kitchen stankin' from the last order dawg
So many cocaine transactions I don't recall
Was Lit, tell The Judge and The Preacher Presiding Over Ya'll
Fuck The Police protocol
We Choppin' Loads Up, In The Crib
No Heat by the stove My toes froze up
Niggas like to fuck up their re-up money
Get rolled up
Bullet holed-up
Ran off on the plug once (Once Nigga)
Minor setback, major comeback
Bitches at the Ritz Carlton I was dumb hype
I dropped the chicken Then remixed it Was dumb white
Fuck her pretty face And that pussy Hoe what your funds like
Fucked her in some $5000 shoes I punch right
Allergic to these weak assholes, nigga gesundheit
Miss my harlem bitch Buss that pussy open In one night
But last time I was Out in New York I got in a gunfight
Blowbiz to the showbiz
I kick rap burnin Like kermit sippin on
Hoe tears
Million dollar world tour A nigga with no spins
Everyday I got a new cousin Nigga we no Kin
And all this internet shit Fucked up the era
That bitch ain't been the same Since Ye' dropped her off
At the airport
They only gave us 28 days So make it last
The black delegation Would like to trade Stacey Dash
For a Adele, Margot Robbie Let's Get It Poppin'
We On, Fuck It For an even trade We'll throw in a Raven Symone
Filthy Jet Black nigga Backstage full of white bitches
No I don't sell like Macklemore But I've got White Privilege
Try not to sell crack no more Trynna stay out the prison
That Heron shit I'll get your ass A gas price sentence
That snitchin' shit Will  get your family And your wife missin'
Play position These niggas friendly As a box of puppies
I drop big nuts On this game They holdin' chicken nuggets
My backwood rollin' is dirty You smell that
Seen myself on comedy central Hope they bring Chappelle back
Feds listenin', all this talk About the scale back
Seen india love nudes A nigga trying to nail that
A couple weeks I'm in Toronto I'ma see all my bitches
But all my niggas can't cross the border For that all star shit
But niggas be creepin' during the weekend Give her that all star dick
I want that pussy, head, mouth Ass, and all that shit

[Ending : Freddie Gibbs]
