[Verse 1]
That history class make me think back, how people react cause I wrote my words with a lit match
Red had me bionic, blue tonic, water looks crystal wrong and gold poses as strongest
Ironic how leaf green wasn't the chronic,but they add fire ahead so they just go along with it
Yellow the og says they see me roll, life story and shit on my tv show
Putting 2 stadiums and a camera in N64, colosseum and darkness for a GameCube flow
But hell, new year, same career, training monsters something fierce
Thinking of names with a pen, now we starting giving it names after gems
Emerald, sapphire, ruby, writing without trying, pearl with platinum and added diamond
Gave hearts to AU, soul to silver too
Now just saying black and white cause were running out of names to do
Another sequel? Maybe a few
As long as the nineties babies think it cool, but the number of the is over done, true
Have we bitten off more than we can chew?
Let me excerpt from the fact it gets me addicted, screen in my face acting as if training was my mission
Listen, to the 8-bit tracks causing nostalgia, listen to the tracks making you want to be a master
Settled down trapper, feel good rapper, niggas come back around like the ring of Saturn
I was addicted to sitting on sky pillar but its funny how things can change nigga
