[Verse One]
Yo, it was a fucked up love
Been tryin' for days just to hit you up
Walked by past you, after class, in the hallways
Wanted to say 'Hi' but you always walked away like
It's like, that I don't even exist
But the most we'd get is a one-sided relationship
You and I, we're both from different worlds
I should set sights on more easier girls
But hey, maybe luck could be winning over here
Maybe one day, we'll be sittin' and sharin' some beers
Riding my handlebars, and kissin' on the car
Man it would be great if we ever went that far
Three years passed, and I still think back
To the little times that I made you laugh
You took a few snaps of us, even if it was nothing
I still wonder whether or not we could've been something
Fallen and broken, like if I was humpty dumpty
I'm just glad I didn't experience you fuckin' dumping me...

[Verse Two]
I thought I stopped the fuckin' thought process
Been regretting the day since both of our eyes met
I said, I was fucking over it
You was too friendly and I didn't even get the messages
It seems that not even my hearts impressed
And it's not like I need my mind frequently checked
Sometimes I see you with another fellow
And I guess for you, white doesn't really go with yellow
You were the gem that I only really sought
But like usual, you were the only already bought...
