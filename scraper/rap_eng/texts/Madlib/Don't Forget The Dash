[Intro:]
Shaz
Flawless
The YZA
Do. You. C. Me?

[Verse 1:]
I wonder if Jesus could hear my screams
Then he could understand the plead, to hear what a nigga need
For fiends, I am the base and it's free if you choose to take it
Don't forsake it, the methods are quite unnatural
Actually, I am the masterpiece before Master P
Could ever make them say ugh, the shooter or the gun
Which is more deadlier, and which could weather the storm
When it rains it pours, I still masturbate to porn
And still cum on the faces of any bitch with a racists father
And make him question his daughter
Like "that isn't her and if it is then fuck her."
We can never get along, on the song
I am confined to the rights of the wrongs
Caused by all these laws that will make you drop your jaw
And oh my god, hallelujah, the flow is even more ruthless
Than an Eric Wright and Jerry Heller, Helen Keller
Killing rappers everywhere, ignoramus or bee speller
Decoding dictations and theology, til I'm banking cash
My name You-C, the 3rd letter, just don't forget the dash

[Verse 2:]
And I compete until my feats got me reaching on top my feet
Overseeing the line of scrimmage until I can't believe
What he is done and he being me
I plan to follow my dreams until they turn into reality
Friday the 13th, the nightmare is arriving
They don't know I've got the element of surprising
Fuck the nation they don't understand the basics
Of this game that we control, like get rid of the same old

[Outro:]
Do You-C Me, and I'm out. YEAGER!!!
I know Ulysses just got happy as fuck I did this
Alright, back to my serious face
