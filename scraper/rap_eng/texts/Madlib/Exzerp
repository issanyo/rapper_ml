[Verse 1: Dexter Dox]
Pop the top and venture off into Pandora's box
Steaming seemingly coming off as an alluring fox
Waking up to the alarming delorean clocks
While the doctor brown screaming we been hijacked by a golden Spock
That moment my focus was broken from commotion
Used the potent potion open my dome and it was stolen
A crafty Laotian bestows upon men the ways of shogun
He told me to show your devotion dive into the Ocean and return with a token
A token for me, for those that complete will be chosen, to live on through me
Truly I followed rules as a loosely as a noose be
Smoothly took my time and ate some couscous where the juice be
Lied to Zeus of a truce Poseidon had offered
Abstruse but No suits you could've swore that I went to Harvard
Live and die by my principles but don't take the pain of a martyr
Take Louis lane by the mane and drown her up in Mariners harbor
There's is no mane like Bruce Wayne that claim to be my father
Remain sane I will reign over Shawn Corey Carter
In time, confined and I still climb
You niggas mimes and I'm still prime
Masqueraded committing kill crimes
Masterly fluent, keep pumping gas cause I'm ruthless
Haphazardous fluid spew from the mouth as I do it
Influenced, from the past I'm a student studied my craft why you clueless
Ass and fucking laugh in amusement you got me last you just stupid, bitch
Booted Cupid into a Dixie stick
Cruel illusions led Isaac newton to be a clueless prick
The only human to move with muted movements
Looted George Lucas while he was dreaming lucid
Replacing the goodies with mucus
The conclusion is undisputed Dexter Dox soon to be executed
