[Intro: J Dilla]
Y'all know what this is, holla
("Nevertheless, I just...")

[Verse 1: J Dilla]
J Dilla, Madlib collab'
Take cats in the back in the lab
(Yeah, c'mon, niggas, bankroll out)
(Uhh, pop somethin, smoke somethin, drink somethin, huh!)
Yeah, yeah, J Dilla, Madlib collab'
Take cats in the back in the lab
And dangerous with pens and pads
I don't even really need to ad-lib the rap
Better fix your traps, or you'll get sah-lapped
By a nigga in a Piston cap
Detroit players, pimps and macks here
We live this, you whack, then it's a wrap
And niggas ain't with that dissin' crap
So don't spit it, I spit back tit for tat
And please don't twist the facts, I'm back in this
To shut down the game and switch it, Jack
Then shake shit up, twist the cap
Now I'm all over the place, get the picture snap
Y'all better beware muh'fuckers
And y'all better prepare for da rawkus

[Interlude]
Yeah, you know how a nigga brang it
Yo, it's veterans up in this muh'fucker
Yeah, so what, let's get loud
Drink somethin'
Yo, where y'all at?
Yeah, we bringin' it to the hood y'all
Yeah, uh, y'all know what this is
Live niggas only, it's not a game, nigga...
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah, J Dilla y'all, come on!

[Verse 2: J Dilla]
J Dilla, Madlib collab'
Take cats in the back in the lab
Heavy like Chevys, and built to last
You ain't built to last, you will collapse
Shoulda did your math, get ready to feel the wrath
When Dill' and 'Lib attack
Better come real with that, niggas yield the yappin'
What you rap ain't filled with facts
If it ain't real don't deal with that
Here to shut down the game, it's Dill' and Mad'
With the rough-ass Brillo pad shit
Live on it when I fire I will react
We out tryin' to fill our fists with scratch
So after you get the dick, get the picture, snap
Y'all better beware muh'fuckers
And y'all better prepare for da rawkus

[Interlude]
Where the party at? C'mon
Push 'em up, yeah
It's all on us, yeah
Y'all free tonight, how y'all feelin'
Pull up in the club and show somethin'
Show some love tonight yeah
Let me see that bankroll, c'mon y'all
Spend some money, yeah, y'all know what this is
Uh-huh! We mummied out, yeah
