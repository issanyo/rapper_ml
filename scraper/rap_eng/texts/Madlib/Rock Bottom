(Madlib tracks, rattlesnake, Battleaxe)

[Verse 1]

I can do what takes you five years in one summer
Cold stunner, came up fast like Roadrunner
People sayin' Mad's on the come-up
But then I felt doing drugs until sunup
Used to get a lot of hummers in my new white Hummer
Now I'm broke. life's a bummer
Caked up laying pipe like a plumber
Now Madchild's the one that they make fun of
Standing in a dark tunnel, but there's no light
Feels impossible for anything to go right
Dark winters, cold summers
Hard to feel fresh in five year old runners
So sullen, life's duller, no color
Teeth fucked up like Old Yeller
Cold chilling, old villain, no feelings
Rock bottom. No ceiling
Put the kid out of his misery, go kill him
I thought this going down but I guess that they don't feel him
I'm clinically insane which is limiting my brain
Now I'm looking for a cure trying to remedy the pain
I found it then I took it, things will never be the same
Now I'm leaning standing crooked while I'm tripping off my name
Yeah ah yo I'm mentally ill, if the drugs don't kill me the memories will
All my enemies will, flag planted up on Vanity Hill
Stick around and see my sanity spill
I don't need a hammer to kill, I'm in Amityville
I'm an amateur from Canada still
I was thinking I was someone trying to stand up on stilts
Now I'm looking in the mirror like this can't be the deal
