Follow me please at ease
Its CAPITOL
Pro era
You know my fucking STEEZ
Its actual and factual
Times 9 cult classic
Pad and pen I write with my third eye magic
Your lacking
Seek and find the divine In my mind
I shine and turn back the hands of time
Designed to rhyme
Lyrical shoot outs with my Smith and Wesson
Blessing
Your Mic sessions
And record my positive aggression
Speak Speech
Got Arrested for my Development
Out of the muck and mire
HBO special
The rendition of the wire no priors
Who wanna ramp with me?
I'm crazy
I'll create all types of fuckery
Lyrical gunshots
What the bloodclot?
Ramadans and Shobot
I fast on niggas
Fake beef
Red 40 won't stain my teeth
I'll bang your head on this hard concrete
What kid!
Bring the ruckas
Bring the motherfucking ruckas
This lyrical dick in your mouth now suck it!
Watch when I come
You'll see man my lyrical semen
I'm a demon believing in my own religion
A lyrical heathen until the day I stop breathing
I'm beasting
Your brain cells plotting your rotten
Little do you know I practice the art of snot boxing
I'm shiftee
Low down dirty and grimy
In the underground thats where you'll find me
Eating niggas food with Mr.Obese
Talk shit you catch a fat lip and missing teeth
Get it right son
Its langston not fucking Keith
What!
