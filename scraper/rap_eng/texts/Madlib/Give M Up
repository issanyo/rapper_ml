[Verse I]
Big booty, but her cooking just right for the pushing
Put a pillow under that bubble and puff kushin'
My new sound system, the nuisance in the villa
Killa, Goodie got the new chicks lit up
I kinda figured I’m a prominent figure
She knew you make it like an encyclopedia, we was all there
His cradle is all red, this cat is shot cat
Backed at the fish house, tapped at your friend's spot
You was crushed, couldn't function and what not
And on the hush, I was crushing at the bus stop
Rose petals, candled up, rub-a-dub on her rub, roll a dub
On my dub shit pumping this, blunt is lit, fuck is this, love?
Yo, I knew she never give him –

[Chorus]
This nigga fucked me four times, four times
He’s talking about he gonna take me out
He ain't even call me once
I call his beeper number, his beeper number

[Verse II]
This nigga think he too good for you, girl
Too hood for you, please
How couldn't you pass on top class niggas
Hot trash trying to drop cash on you, fuck
Whole world crush, my heart crush
Poolside with it, school time bitching they get it
Wet britches, wet bitches and such, I'd rather
Kick it with a chick with some class, and some cash
No pun intended but a big ole ass
If I was pimping, bitch, I wouldn't have to pitch bags
Kick raps, kick back on my back, a lot of kids nap
Stop popping got it locked like kids' flattops
Black top on them, my -, like a refugee
If my potty mouth is a problem I suggest you leave
I think it's best that she –

[Chorus]
He never pays bills, everybody telling me he's a just a sorry ass
I was on the four-o-five, though, on the other day, high ass hell and shit
Motherfucker call me on a motherfucking collect number
He ain’t even got a house, I’m dating a homeless motherfucker

[Outro: Blu]
