[Verse 1]
I wake up rolling piff while I'm still yawning
Take a couple calls get rich in the morning
Time change like my new watch
Your girl was wearing it while she was chilling at my new spot
I was balling on a bitch
Two weeks later went Waldo on a bitch (Hah)
They keep falling for the kid
Throw a little paper and they all over your dick
Get your bread up, so sorry I don't cuff
Money come to me dog I'm in no rush
Papa kush, sour D's, rolled up
Once they heard how I got it they showed me more love
Ten Benji's, twenty 20's, rubber bands
If you ain't talk money then I don't understand
And you think that it's funny, but I'm the fucking man
But you a broke boy, you live in a whole other land
I don't fuck with drugs
I fuck with Mary, she just suck me off
You little goons stuck in love
I got my mind on my money and the fucking fuzz
You a pretty lady, lady
And I noticed you been tweeting all my lyrics lately
Get some goose now we slow and wavy
No more Ciroc it had me going crazy
Cause I ain't even a drinker
I'm a smoker, I ain't even a thinker
Said, I ain't even a drinker
I'm a smoker, I ain't even a thinker
Light it...

And it go, and it go, and it go like...

[Verse 2]
Too toned little bitch, dog you ain't real
Two phones in my whip but there ain't scales
If you ain't bout money then I can't feel
If you ain't gon' suck me, bitch we can't chill
My Mondays are fun days
Cause I be getting paid Sunday to Sunday
Will I get to fame? Someday yup, someday
I say it with the cockiness dog trust me
Cause I been grinding for it since the kid in the womb
And I'mma grind regardless till the kid in the tomb
And if I smell dro when I walk in the stu
I'm like "hell no" and I spark up my blue
People acting dirty so I brought them a broom
And bitches acting flirty so I bought us a room
I never met Melissa but I felt it was faith
So I just text Patricia telling her I'll be late
What you, finna get into? We can go on a date
Or we can lay low count this cake on my plate
See I'm about to blow while the rest of you stay
I'm just keeping it real cause the rest of you fake, hey

And it go, and it go, and it go like...
I told y'all we wasn't playing around
Y'all better get more serious
