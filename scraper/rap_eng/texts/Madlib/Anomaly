Intro :
There's no point
What do you do it for?
What's this hiphop all about man?
Why are you rhyming?
Why are you being so poetic?
Theres no point
What's your reason?

Chorus :
The way that I be spitting makes you think they written
From the heart and the soul I let it take control
A part of me, that I can't hide forever
An anomaly unmatched 'bout what I measure 2x

Verse 1 :
The filipino kid getting closer inch by inch
Flow with spit, restless shoulder from endless lyrics within
On a roll graduated in school but still student of the game let these words be my tool
Luck, don't even exist when fame is just a given
You'll never last they only going for the image
Covered by my eyes, to truly prove my loyalty
Forever Ill City, Graffiti, rhymes and poetry
Inside my veins
Can't understand what I'm saying? Let me take you there
Internet cafe's with cheaper fares
Cigarettes and lemonade
With the fake streetwear
Original to us, cause we never had real shit
Been slaves our whole lives people think it ain't exist
Mabuhay forever free, since 1946
But never really free since our culture is mixed
Been whipped by sticks could only see
And never talk about dictatorship
Let it sink for a second
Martial Law locked up my mama and my bretheren
Papa never really meant to stay he had another
Brought the family to sunder but the king was born, in 1997
Uplifting Magalona's dream till I reach the heavens
A curse and a dream, A curse and a dream
Iloilo City, Philippines what my veins bleed
Forever slaves we different breeds
Beef with one of us you beef with all of us
All of my kababayan put your hands up, put your hands up
Fight till we're free, fight till we're free
Everyone of us, an Anomaly

Outro :
A part of me, that I can't hide forever
An anomaly unmatched 'bout what I measure
