Intro:
Oh oh (oh) pass that spliff bwoy...

Starange Wondah:
Yes yeas y'all O.C.C. be double O be the best y'all

Let me feel up shortie with wide breast y'all
It ain't no test y'all. Come on, break it down take it there
We take it there, we about to take it up

Top Dawg:
I'm pulling the evidence form all y'all fakin' ass residents
Who claim that y'all community clam and come from heaven send
You best to get out of my face with all that yappin'
I told you aboout that flappin', about shit that can happen
I'm askin' you to gwan head with the Boot
The y'all weeds good but the green weed no good

Starange:
Mad niggas wanted so I'm glad y'all could make it
Starange freakin' with the flow even with my hair braided
Yo I hate it, when fake MC's make believe
To be the bomb on the mic and get over with mad G
Now Fab 5 is like a household name
On thee attack that was lead by Starange
You know me chillin' with number 2 and the O.G
Hoes be on me like that glow on Obe Won Konobi
Can't you see that wehn the storms on the shelf
We totally crush LP's (we don't need no one else)
So ask who can you rn to bus you won't escape
From no one Starange the Shogun you hate

(Caboy boy caboy boy) O.G.C. we build or destroy
Come again (caboy boy caboy boy) O.G.C. we either build or destroy

Louieville:
Do he dare think he will survive?
Goin' against Ville Stluggah number 2 from Fab 5
Originoo Gunn Clappa yeah batter originoo gunn stasher
Tory if you didn't know end of story
Part like land make way cause here come Louie
Quiet riot gets rid of the fools quickly
See it's thee, 3 dimensional beams guns apon ya
Storm watch watch clock if not yous a gonner
I'd rather be meetin' niggas in time and square
Cause what is rare and gettin' extinct is niggas with shit to share
I see his face I see his feet
I see the gun and bwoy you are gon dead
With 2 beer gun shots to him head
Leave the war behind you painted tin red
Thee O.G. with smoke spliff to him dead
It's your choice you best not forget it
You better listen to the words I just said
Cause me serious Armageddon a fight
And we be prepared and aware and on sight for the enemy
(Where you gonna run to?)
Too much flappin' pon streets need green
Take it back to beat down a dope fiend

Starange:
Son I know what you mean cause shorties sill say that
I know that ain't jack high off 8 black

Louieville:
Tough guy they lie they see moms in the precinct

Starange:
Sayin' where could he be cause I haven't seen him recent

For the business, what is this?

Louieville:
Dismiss these niggas with the quickness

Starange:
Get your shortie wop cause I heard she had the thickness

Louieville:
