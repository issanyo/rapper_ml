[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Phoo....

[Verse]
Cut the shit ,Take a sip, Make it lit
Take it in the meat grinder
I spit this beat, to burn the beat lighter
Greatest mc, hitting this scene like street fighter
Giving you kicks, only to make his feet lighter
Spitting black, so my followers be hyped up
I am soft, so they choose this; D'cider
Acting tough, to get me, inside her
You don't get a single line: like they were: insider
I took the escalator
To my escalade door
Where I'll educate her
I'm an "ejaculater"
Later we will pop pills and escalate, yeah
I will wait at the green sign, exit waiter
I'm talking nice, so She'll be my sexy slave, yuh
Getting looks from your sister like I've already slain her
She makes see, the White underwear
I make her V: Divide under where? (The sheets!)
No answer
I just got some money transferred
So I have to take it, print it to spend it even faster
I don't care where I'm going
In the air like a Boeing
This is getting boring
So I have to mix it up
Mix one cup
Making tricks on top
I will never stop
Slop my cock in my dirty sock
Sex and drugs, this is Rock
You already know what's up
Take your hands up!
Now take my hand pump
And make your pants drop
I'm making lands hot
I'm making lads jump
I'm cooking jams: top
Hip to the damn hop
Listen to millennials, cuz they want the millions
I fit on every beat you make, call me a chameleon
I hate my winter jacket, I got claustrophobia
"13 and you're dead", now you got  triskaidekaphobia
Cry, scared of my Nokia, cuz I hit u with it
Can't see like Mongolians, drugs, they were the limit
Talking of opiate,  endure what I've written
Couldn't say that its spitting cuz in the past I spat
This the aftermath of my English class, I hate the math 
The students and staff, every time I said "I rap"
They just stared and laughed
And I'm working to say, "look, bitch, where I'm at"!
Moving on
I don't really wanna talk about it
You never had second thoughts
U know that I doubt it
You know that I'm bout it
And I'm good enough
But I respect the fame
And to stand on top
Scared to flop
Like Em' or Pac
Death, or worse
Missin' words, that have driven me!
Fittin' me rhymes, until they live in me
Wishing a life, where all bitches want to be with me
Nevermind, we're all doomed!
Now It's time to stop!
