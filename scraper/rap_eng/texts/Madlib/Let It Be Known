[Hook]
Crate diggin' nigga now I own this microphone
Let it be known, let it be known [3x]
Let it be known, let it be known
Let it be known, let it be known

[Verse 1: Declaime]
Aaall stand clear
I got this piece to preach
With what I speak
And for those that chose to sleep
Don't let us meet out in the open streets
With cool works for those
Who woke up and didn't sleep
Let's go out and dig holes
For the weak and bury deep
Goes I dare to dance with I
The rhyme wise who flies high
And rain down like razor blades
Cut niggas up lolly spades
Hesitate you lose
Mastermind it's Madlib masterpiece
Let's take it to the streets with this
I just can't miss with this
Anytime I be owning this
Let it be knowing this nigga try to hit but miss
See me I'm talking bound
'Bout to blow up in every spot
Only drop innovative Hip Hop
Tie up your whole block
Taking up your time like a clock
I swatch now watch so when it happens
They'll all know, they'll all know, they'll all know

[Hook]
Crate diggin' nigga now I own this microphone
Let it be known, let it be known [3x]
Let it be known, let it be known
Let it be known, let it be known

[Verse 2: Declaime]
Nod your heads to this
Like in a "beat-nic" joint
Let me take control of your soul
As I gets my point
Across at all cost [thy place for keeps]
Meaning I keep to myself
The status of my wealth
So you won't spend my riches
Which is the way I relate with this rap
Ten dudes never look back
Soon they'll be all over the map
West coast east coast world wide
Whether coolin' at the club
Or rollin' in your ride
This shit will widen your stride
I'll tell you the truth with nothin' to hide
Got God on my side
So can't shit harm me
But on the other hand I can harm you
With these words I will like wits
Lashing y'alls all in the lips so you won't [slip]
And say some shit that trips
And falls, falls down let it be known
Me and my niggas don't fuck around
Madlib mastermind the sound
That you can get use to for your daily diet
I don't like slang and dope but I advise you to try it
Let it be known
Crate diggin' nigga now I own this microphone
Let it be known

[Hook]
Crate diggin' nigga now I own this microphone
Let it be known, let it be known [3x]
Let it be known, let it be known
Let it be known, let it be known
