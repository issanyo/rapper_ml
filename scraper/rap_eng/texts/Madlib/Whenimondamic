[Intro: Wildchild]

Ha Ha Ha Hah, yes yes
Return of the B-boy style
Props to all the B-boys and B-girls in da house
("Cuz when I'm on the mic I like to speak freely")
Check it out

[Chorus: Wildchild]

I got the vibe, check 1, 2 check 1, 2, 3
Wild with the style, check 1, 2 check 1, 2, 3
Does Jack wreck the rhyme? Hell yeah
("Cuz when I'm on the mic I like to speak freely")

[Verse 1: Wildchild]
Yo, as easy as it may seem MC'ing is not a capa-
Bility for most to possess, you gotta catch up
Take the time to create, construct demonstrate
Set wack MC's straight, drinkin' a V8
I'm like a baseball player on track, got on steel cleats
I represent the conscience styles until it hits the streets
My backbone attack wack poems, got mad rap tones
I destroy fake Madlib beats and Crackerjack poems (Ha-Ha)
It's time for lunch already, yes past lunch
I eat MC's like Captain Crunch, I attack and then punch
Rap in such different styles that's unlike yours
Wack MC's, I'll point you out and point out all of your flaws
All of your jaws get broken, styles no jokin'
Battling straight up battling is what I'm provokin'
But I'll die before these wack MC's infect thee
Hip Hop industry to the point I cannot breathe

But if Wildchild dies before Wildchild wakes
I pray to God to step down and take out all them fake
MC's, pretty please
"Cuz when I'm on the mic I like to speak freely"

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Wildchild]
Down with the Liks, Jump straight from the bass onto the kicks
Non-freestylin' MC's fall straight down in the pits
My name be Jack, spontaneous freestylist when I catch wreck
Brothers bite me so hard saying my rhymes I ain't even wrote yet
So I take it to the max, take out Fake-Funkin' Jacks
Get to the point as I rock over Madlib bumpin' tracks
"You used to get busy at open mics?" Nah, I still do
I kill crews, lyrically, spiritually, yo I will do
Anything it takes to bring B-boy style back
And the thanks for you to make ya say my rhyme style's phat
But I'll die before these wack MC's infect the
Hip Hop industry to the point I cannot breathe

But if Wildchild dies before Wildchild wakes
I pray to God to step down and take out all them fake
MC's, pretty please
"Cuz when I'm on the mic I like to speak freely"

[Chorus: x2]
