[Intro]
What up, what up, y'all?
Had to let this verse go
The DOOM beat was a sick fit
Get your spliff lit. Light the paper and let it burn slow
Just relax yourself...

Wanna get fucked by a bad bitch. Not by the badges
Paintin' on canvas: what I love to do!
Take a step in my canvas, odyssey in shoes
Gotta catch the ambiance like Odell do
Lose my mind without 'em. This an ode to the tunes
Reminisce like Smooth to Fruity Loops up in my room
Notice on the door, we've got a few months to move
Mom is panickin' 'cause she financially screwed
Shitty situation, but I made it out soon enough
Sticky medication. Break it down, roll a blunt
Stuck in a mock buckin' oncomin' raucous
Duckin's for chumps I be hungry and huntin'
Movin' through the rugged. Shootin' at the summit
Diminish inhibitions 'cause I'm comin' for the buffet
Latchin' onto music cut the fear of plummet
Patchin' up bruises plus the cuts with the blood gushin', aye!

[Outro: MF DOOM Sample]
Keep the bong lightin'. Straight through the songwritin'
Keep the bong lightin'. Straight through the songwritin'

[Outro: Renegade]
I love it! This music. It's my remedy like the drugs I've been usin'
Abusin'. Amusin'. Nothin' left for losin'. So fuck it! I love it!
