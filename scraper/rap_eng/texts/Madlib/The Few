If there's a pond then there must be a river or some rain that falls above
Must be a place for the water to go if it's to be just as it was
I feel it implies all the magic about us all of water we're composed
It's the immortal conductor of current teaching law straight to the Soul of us the few, the few
If you can contain it you're able to give it open mental space is key
Then from the life of the well that's within you'll learn to have the will to teach
And I want you to know you're made of immortal things
Supportive things
And the order of things got something to do with you
You're made of immortal things so go on enjoy your being
Ha
That's what I want you to know

It's time to set the record straight
A fonk ginger to all hose that hate
Here's a dose of some hope and truth hope you can relate, homie
I wrote this while high while a brother was buzzin'
Just got done talkin' to my cousin who's an O.G. like me
Certified gangster who set himself free
We talked about our past
Chopped about our futures our health and who just passed
The youth and their new teachers, preachers and prophets
Wall street and how America's lost it's got damn mind so damn blind
Big ass bullies just don't fully understand
They ain't living life if they have to kill another man for it
And no we don't forget best believe me baby bubba that
You're gonna get what you deserve
Having the nerve falsely ruling all people
Knowing damn well God made his people equal
