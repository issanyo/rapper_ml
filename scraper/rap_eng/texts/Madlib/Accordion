[Intro: Aceyalone]
Uhh, yeah - Today's Easter

[Verse 1: Scorpio102798]
Spent his entire check on that muthafucken rollie man
That rollie only tells the time
It's time to get a bolder man
With boulders on the shoulder
Make the struggle my main bitch again

It's hard pretending that you fittin in
With the McChicken in the kitchen
All alone up on Thanksgiving
This feelin is killin
Something deep inside me
Please remind me why killin is so wrong

Demons sit beside me
You hate me?
Well get in line
I'm tired and sick of liars
Don't fuck with pride of a lion

Uncompatible
No matches
Dropping heavy shit
You want it lighter

Get a light
Can not comprehend any of this fire

Why oh why oh you do this to me
I was just catching buzz
But my grandmamma always told me to nip it in the bud

What the fuck
The same bitches that dissing me wanting love
What is up
I say keep your distance
'less you need a plug

Cuz
I provide that fire
Wack rappers needa retire
Bow to me I am your flier
We liftin this shit up higher
Your stone is low i'm solo while my grind is passing out flyers
I'm going to the bank while these bitches admire Tyra
I'm more into ****

Stop preaching to me as if you's a choir
I know what i'm doing
Ima do me
Rapping through the wire

Popping off n flipping beef as if I was a fryer
I'm the seller
You the buyer
In the cellar
Getting wired

No tires cuz you ain't rollin
Three fingers in all three holes n
Heavy balls is what shes holdin
Mind in the gutter like bowlin

AU shoutin cuz I'm goldin
Your job is grinding the pole n
The fact that you always loaded
Reaction just like a foal in

Headlights
Head lice

Confused
In tune
To tunes
In tombs
The gloom
Is doom
The broom
A witch or two
The switcharoo
