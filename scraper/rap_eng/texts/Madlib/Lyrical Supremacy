[Intro - Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]
Holden McNeil - "So, what brings you two dirt merchants to my neck of the woods?"
Jay - "Oh, I'll tell you what our necks are doing in your woods, where's our motherfuckin' movie check?"
McNeil - "Well, look at these morose motherfuckers right here, smells like somebody just shit in their cereal... BUNG! That was good, come in."

[Verse 1]
I spit lyrical supremacy, what these niggas been tellin' me
I'm 'bout to take it over, at least that's what I been yellin' G
Don't got alot of friends, all these niggas my enemies
I kill them all, predict their fall, we the fuckin' propellers, G
Rappin' on the track, connectin' with all my melodies
Ain' never buyin' all the fake dreams these niggas sellin' B
Snappin' on the beats, spittin' leavin' in ecstasy
Hip-hop might've died, but niggas we the successors, lead
We ain' fuckin' with wack niggas, none of yall fakin' fellas
I'm walkin' into the room, no denyin' success you smell us
I'm makin' lemonade like life was givin' me lemons
Hella smoke up in my blunt liftin' my feet like umbrellas
Never spit counterfeit, I could go to acapella
With hella metaphors like Amphetamines with some Stella
I'm always goin' hard, always give 'em the best of me
You never ballin' hard like you was chillin' Development League
All I do is winnin', never get the better of me
I'm killin' the track and all you doin' is buryin' feet
Covert Coup, walk through we heavy as Meek, belly the beats
Shit stinker than Wellington beef
Inhalin' we chief, paper readily breezed, we puff and pass like stellary Brees with celery please
Grapes, the fellas we leafed
We unexpectedly leaped onto the stage, we exploded
Muhfuckas it's potent, you shoulda known this
We opened the gates for mo' shit
You better respect the notion, THC potions, we smokin'
Ain' noone on my muhfuckin' level, that's right

[Break - Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]
Daphne - "I think they passed out."
Fred - "Great, what do we do with them now?"
Shaggy - "Let's cut out their kidneys and sell 'em to the black market, leave 'em in a seedy motel bathtub full of ice."
Jay - "Check that shit out man, the internet!"

[Verse 2]
I'm comin' back with number two, they tellin' me to stop it
How 'bout a no, fuck you, take off your arms and chop it
Bass so loud, we threaten to bust out the speaker, pop it
Baby lift it up like elevators, and its hot so drop it
No, I'm not a gimmick, so pick up the tape and cop it
Walkin' through the streets, bitches, weed and money
Steady mobbin', knobbin'
No raw, please, cover it with whore cheese,
Ain' noone on my level so tell them divorcees
To stop hatin' 'fore I jump up like Jason Vorhees
Decapitate the bitches, now may I have the floor please?
Take that back, I'm 'bout to take it over
Guns up out the chopper and now tell them niggas that the wait is over
I'm the headliner of the show, ain' nobody better
Call it star power on them bitches like I'm Hugh Hefner
Bitch I'm Miley Cyrus, them know that you gon' buy it
Forcin' you to try it until you admit you like it
Like mind control, MK-ULTRA-marketed
Explosions from the underground like there was a shark in it
Yeah I'm uncontrollable so maybe you should market it
Give me billions of dollars and I'll think of carpetin' the pedal on the game
Til' I'm blue in the heart and face
I'mma smack the taste out your mouth for considerin' passin' ever on the ace
It's not about that paper but a nigga still up on that chase
