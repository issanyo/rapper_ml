Can't believe I finally got everything I wanted
It seems half before I mention now how see to find you
'Cause hot, too hot to try swag
Hot too hot to hunt swag
I used to say..
Lying to the world within
Stayed on the telephone
It ..my end of friend
Live candle with no faith
Some about playing there
Every mistake I make
Real loud inside my head before I met you

Chorus:
Everything I want is here
Everything I want is here
Everything I want is here
All looks perfectly clear
Everything I want is here
All looks perfectly clear
And as long as I'm nothing
Yes i'll be so real
Everything I want is here
Everything I want is here
All looks perfectly clear
Everything I want is here
Everything I want is here
All looks perfectly clear
I'm so lucky I love you 'cause I'm so real with me
Growing up at the bar
Put so faded bar
Thinking I was.. You told me how to look myself
Forever..you

[Chorus:]
You're so faded baby
You look so creative baby
Forever I love you
