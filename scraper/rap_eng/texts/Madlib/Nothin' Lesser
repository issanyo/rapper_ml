[Sample]
"Nigga, yo mother so tall, she hit her head on Slocene and fall on Florence"
"Yo momma where Lysol for perfume"
"Nigga, your mother so ugly that when she smiles, her face hurts"
"Her breath smell like spoiled milk, kinda like shes been chewing on rocks"

[Verse I: Laku]
Verbally killing it, UN affiliate
Crowd controllin' it, forever standin' my grounds I'm holding it
Kick for the hood, kick it for those in the strong
Kick it for my all niggas still here and the rest of the [?]
Kickin' it while I dwell in the street, or while I be stressed
While I be gettin' dressed and just black in the middle of sex
While I be hittin' shorty off in the back, I just be usin'
The sound of the claps for one of my thunderous tracks
Rappers be buggin' thinkin' they hot, until I showed 'em
They nothin' but duns, you was never blowin' the spot, I don't
Catch cold, the only thing I'm catchin' is wreck
And catchin' your girl at the bank while she cashin' a check (what)
Finessin' a track - blessin' it black
The number one brother of soul it don't get better than that

[Verse II: Dino Brave]
Two for timin', shout out, this one's for money rhymes
Take to 'em hard boiled, charbroil a fraud
Holy ghost Peter Plymouth Rock landed on us
I'll native Kareem sky hook 'em, Dano raps book 'em
Hawaii five tries to come a lie jive
Euro express be offin' of your head to the rest
Box slap your teeth gold raps with a foot in a sewer cap
Sucka dance em, and hit 'em off like Noah
To a eyy thing, yo that'll show and prove in my cash flow
Rippin' out long dough featurin' prophecy
How I stay so, gimme my freedom
Yeah, you wanna join the UN you can't beat 'em

[Sample]
"Yo momma so big she's living large"
"Nigga, yo momma ain't got no back she's always frontin'"
"Nigga, I cut your mother's arms off so she couldn't kick it, I mean - whoops, I said it wrong"
"Your momma's hair so short she got to roll it with needles"
