[Chorus: D'angelo]
I can take you there just follow me
I can take you there just follow me
I can take you there just follow me
I can take you there

[Verse 1: Madlib]
The wall on which the prophets wrote
Is cracking at the seams
Upon the instruments of death
The sunlight brightly gleams
Every man is torn apart
With nightmares and with dreams
Between the iron gates of fate
The seeds of time were sown
And watered with the deeds of those
Who know and who are known

[Bridge: Madlib]
Knowledge is a deadly friend
When no one sets the rules
The fate of all mankind I see
Is in the hands of fools
Knowledge is a deadly friend
When no one sets the rules
The fate of all mankind I see
Is in the hands of fools
Confusion will be my epitaph
As I crawl a cracked and broken path
If we make it we can all sit back and laugh

[Chorus: D'angelo]
I can take you there just follow me
I can take you there just follow me
I can take you there just follow me
I can take you there

[Verse 2: Madlib]
I'm on the outside looking inside
What do I see
Much confusion, disillusion
All around me
You don't possess me
Don't impress me
Just upset my mind
Can't instruct me or conduct me
Just use up my time
The keeper of the city keys
Puts shutters on the dreams
I wait outside the nigga's door
With insufficient schemes
On soft grey mornings widows cry
The wise men share a joke
I run to grasp divining signs
To satisfy the hoax

[Bridge: Madlib]
Knowledge is a deadly friend
When no one sets the rules
The fate of all mankind I see
Is in the hands of fools
Knowledge is a deadly friend
When no one sets the rules
Confusion will be my epitaph
As I crawl a cracked and broken path
If we make it we can all sit back and laugh

[Chorus: D'angelo]
I can take you there just follow me
I can take you there
I can take you there just follow me
I can take you there just follow me...
