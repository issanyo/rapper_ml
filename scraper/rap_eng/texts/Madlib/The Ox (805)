[Intro]
Haha
Cause you know Confucius said to get a big head, ya know
They think that they’re the only, the only musicians that are saying something
And the show continues, ladies and gentlemen
There, cause we not going to tell you no lie

Now, we have the one and only, Madlib, y’all, make noise

Yes, peace to the worlds, you know
But I got to hold mine down, check it out
If a nigga didn’t know, I represent the Ox everywhere I go now

[Verse I: M.E.D.]

[Chorus: Poke]
