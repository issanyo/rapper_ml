[Intro]
It don't matter neo-
Turn the fuckin' beat on!

[Verse I]
Switch days tryna get paid
Niggas, tryna get bitches laid in the shade
Sock niggas different ways
Yo nigga this the A, this the K
This the motherfuckin' switch blade
My shit stay, army brigaded out of that raiders home
Backyard feeling you can sniff grown
Grizz grills, gorillas grippin chrome
Grown niggas flipping phones, naw nigga, flip is flown
Where you been at?
Was in that, pen it, when he been at
In it with the, "Is he?", dizzy on his lidap
Dap niggas with me, where you been at?
I been busy, pick yo phone, grabbin' it over, I'll be back
Go!

[Chorus]
We got it fully cracking
We got it crackin' and popping
Showing no signs of stopping
Started, fo'real

[Verse II]
Bucket 24oz of it, bounce buzzin', niggas count money
Out hustling just to fuck, bitches bounce for me
Without money you broke, broke niggas is jokes
I quote Ra cause "I ain't", the dank lit up, smoke
Drank sippin' the whole nine, my whole tape
Don't hate, grow cake and keep ya ho straight
Save the pimpin for pimps, I get my chips for the chips
And hit tels' for the tail, ya chick tell she a fail, homie
The fox tail is queen
Block begging for them knots and ain't clocking the green
I got dollars on the team, models out of dreams
That will shower you with things that ya eyes never seen
Ride by, eyes high off the steam on the ez, with the deez on it
Vietnamese on they knees want it
They wanted Blu but ain't have no clue
They want the route but ain't have no route
This ain't about Kunta Kinte, but the cunt I'm kin to
On a Wednesday, I stay with a blunted mental
What ya friend say, what she tryna get into
Bitch, I been gay
Naw, I'm straight fucking with it you but yo

[Chorus]
We got it fully cracking
We got it crackin' and popping
Showing no signs of stopping
Started, fo'real
