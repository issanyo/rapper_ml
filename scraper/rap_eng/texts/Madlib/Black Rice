Napoleon Da Legend [verse 1]
On my Kapernick activist bagging it up
While u babbling I’m traveling and stacking em bucks
Gut check from a javelin they patching em up
I’m irrational and passionate when mashing em up
Like Akhenaton tapping on buttons up at the Pentagon
Megadon leader of the black Renaissance
Dropping jewels for the neighborhood Youth
The Last Mohican that the labels weren’t able to fool
I Say the truth I don’t get paid to assume so stay tuned
I don’t blame if you shocked you listen to fake news
Day 1 they were skeptic I got em Day 2
Got em swearing the second of Christ came thru
That’s Jesus ... that ain’t me I'm sipping grey goose
Playing it cool that must be some good K2
Bring the cake thru and let the whole tape play thru
Playing 2K black rice and boulet too
You ain’t living it it’s too late to relate to
This is the raw without the filter that T pain use
Pre-game Booze it’s innate don’t debate fools
Shredded headed to the caymans on a 3 day cruise
Like Sekou Touré In Guinea I get busy
The Chances of winning slim like Heidi Klum skinny
The game is coon city half the shit they do silly
I’ll be good new kicks and that triple goose fit me

Napoleon Da Legend [verse 2]
Blind to the hate I stay playing collie Buddz
Solo rapper rock alone and kill a posse cut
Now that I’m buzzing think I might need a body double
Was blessed with god given talent and a lot hustle
Fast-twitch muscle when I speak the shit subtle
I don’t cuddle miss I still dodging piss puddles
Shit is lit tho I’m flip mode in Gitmo, Diplo
Should I let that kid flow? "Shit no"
Slick flow Denzel I feel like I can’t fail
Some claim they popping but I swear that I can’t tell
Breath in a chem Trail let my lung sort it out
Allergic to the bull peep the slug my gun coughing out
Get tossed out should’ve put in now you lost out
Going off route now its back to the dog house

Napoleon Da Legend [verse 3]
No competition was forced to battle my own shadow that would foreshadow the fact some rappers more fragile
Carry the torch ride out without a horse saddle
Dodging when they be sending shots I’m of course agile
Stay the course stand firm like Jordan’s statue
You crying for they support they wanna get passed you
I'm just caught up in my capsule never passive
My Sound’ll still be living after this era passes
Like when crack brought terror to the masses
Good and the bad it also brought rappers that were charismatic
