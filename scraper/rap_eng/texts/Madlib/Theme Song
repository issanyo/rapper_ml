[Verse]
Swinging into action like a motherfucking movie star
Webs are my transport because I don’t own a car
Too poor to take the bus I fight crime for free
Wear a mask while I do it so nobody knows me
The newspaper on my back man they’re too nosey
Tell these Ben Reilys to kneel down and blow me
Whoa, sticky flow finish foes quickly
I got 8 limbs bitch I’ll beat your ass swiftly
I’ll leave a note so the cops will know who did it
’Your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man‘ and I ain’t kidding
Straight outta the panels nerd without the powers
But from behind this mic the world will be ours
Just a kid with a dream trapped inside Queens
Dominating these wannabes and I’m only nineteen
Superhero royalty, bitch kiss the spandex
Making MJ go down south no Texas
Venomous enough to leave you dangling I’m crazy
Save your life sike snap your neck Gwen Stacy
Watching Jonah Hill, sipping on that Jameson
Wondering if the New York Mets will ever win again
Stopping crooks left right and centre in time for dinner
You’re left on the brink of death but I’m not a killer
Fictional character but whose writing is realer
I spew venom so tell me whose sicker
Eyes on the mask lined so you can’t see me
John Cena, that was a shitty quip please don’t kill me
Red and blue better run when I come through
Corner you before I take a whiff do I smell poo?
I like how this sounds got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero needs his theme music
