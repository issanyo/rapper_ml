[Verse 1: Alex Ruffin]

It was all three years ago
Sitting at the computer, far-fetched with a plan to blow
Cypher with my homies, revolve around like a mary go
Evolve when I'm stoned like poliwhirls and clefairys, whoa
I don't even need that shit
Cause if I'm chiefin' I'm leadin' these niggas Matt Cassels
Ass backwards, then go act like they Zap Branni..
Gin I just binge off these words like a bad habit
These beats are edible fry em up just like Phillip J
Begin to fade because I'm way cooler than Noob and K Liang
Its safe to say that my music looking real promising
But Rome wasn't built in a day I'm feeling accomplished still

Hook: I'm true to myself they act like that ain't right, I ain't tryna switch it up man, that ain't right, They act like I ain't good enough, that ain't right, that ain't right, that ain't right (2x)

[Verse 2: Alex Ruffin]

I can't imagine being comatose
I'd prolly sound lethargic, I'm over heads like that floating boat
In smash bros melee I'm deadly spittin' like motor boat
Fire flame spitter just times it by three dhalsims and three thousand
Outcast since sega saturns
Stayed to myself cause they judging like Greg Mathis
Let me not get ahead of myself like Ichabod
These niggas used to roast me now they all up on my shiskabob
A distant nod is what I give em I'm chillin please simmer down
I'm writing in my room and if they shooting shells then my shits winged and blue
I hop in the booth, known to speak the truth
Cause these fools will play you short like R2D2 but
Stay golden like CP30 its sharks in the water this reef ain't what it seem so scurry

Hook: I'm true to myself they act like that ain't right, I ain't tryna switch it up man, that ain't right, They act like I ain't good enough, that ain't right, that ain't right, that ain't right (2x)
