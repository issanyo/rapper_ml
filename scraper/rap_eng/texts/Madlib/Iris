And Im
Still that same motjher fucker spitting in yo face
Lift it up and slam it judge judy with the case
Jumping off the stage i'm a man of good taste
Nice lips wide hips and thin waist bitch i'm
Sexy Text me gotta a short fuse don't vex me

Had to cruise around wit a dame name lexi
Gotta stop by to pick up  chelsea
All my bitches smart and that's word up to betsy

Never spend a penny hoe what the fuck you think
Red eye wink with a 40 ounce to drink
Push it to the brink fresh fur on the  mink
Call me justin timberlake i'm always nsync

All about the kink and i surf Cloud nine
The Whole city is mine and i design with one line
Going after mine intertwine the divine
Shoot for the stars astronomy columbine


I really think it's fine there is someone you should meet
5 10 you've been standing in the street
We all gut urges man we all gotta eat
Put your phone down there's a pimp in the street
There's a pimp in the street
There's a pimp in the street


Front to the back motherfucker let's bounce
Back to the front mother fucker lets bounce

King of the jungle i'm a tiger with the Pounce
Smoked out titties out chilling with an ounce

Grab you by the snot and and i'm flipping with the most
Can't really measure  when your busy playing host
Walk amongst the dead trust in the holy ghost
I got you in a jam that's why your fucking toast

Smoking on the low best friend paul maul
Don't brawl get small looking at the call
My baby from italy her legs long and tall
No marinara but her face meets balls

When you need a beat murdered who ya gonna call?
Kush from nepal got my system Slow mo
Smile for the camera while i go pro
I'm a master cheif without the fucking halo

If you really say so i'm looking in your eyes
If your really say so i'm looking at your lies
If you really say so i can't be your guide
If you really say so i say  it with pride
If you really say so stick by side
If you really say so please never hide
If you really say so looking into my eye
If you really say so i'm forever hig
