[Verse 1]

Who ‘gon sit the throne, who that King of Jungles
This humble nigga won’t say nothing, but I’ll bumble that I got it
Gotta pocket full of posies for ya niggas
Turn ya all to ashes if ya ass ‘gon say something
I just caught some fire
Hallelujah was banger, how I do it
Hallelujah I be saying nigga
God got a brother slaying nigga
And i ain’t slow to go insane if a nigga think he swankin’ better
I’m on top of the pyramid
Appearing with ego shit with periods to let you know I meant it
I’m the greatest
My whole team Prosperity get green just like we Popeye, uh
I’m tryna pop eyes with some dope lines
And some dope flows, let these hoes know
How the tongue go, how the pen go
How I ‘gon write checks on checks
And pimp it like I’m P Diddy
Flying city after city spitting filthy like I’m Big Biggie
Nineteen chains like Slick Ricky

[Verse 2]

What are you doing, what are you doing
What have you done
You blessed my nigga, you ain’t take it for granted
You lie to yourself, you say that you know where you going
You ain’t shit right now and I don’t think that you ‘gon be
Look at yourself, you lie in the mirror
You rely on a miracle cause you ain’t finna
Dig in some dirt, look for coal
Build you a fire, you so cold
I don’t get it, niggas are dying daily
Your homie freed his soul he flying freely
Couldn’t live his life all through, no
Cause the angels came down tot took his soul
What are you doing, what are you doing
It’s a new year, new you or whatever
Be clever, get your ass up off the wall
Show ‘em something so they’ll get up and clap you off
You dream of getting what you wanted
Wake up now, what are you doing
Bless up and, show ‘em who you are
Stand in the mirror know who the fuck you are
And what the hell you be
I’m being aggressive, I wonder what you doing
You talk to me passionately, about what you seek
‘Bout some Rolexes and some Merce-Benz
Youget hype pretty quick and I repeat begin, I repeat begin
Now I ain’t begging no more, you closing your own door
And I ask myself, I ask myself
What are you doing, what are you doing

[Outro]

You taking paths
Well where are you going
To the moon you dream
What are you doing
You ask yourself, you ask yourself
(What are you doing)
You on the roll, avoid them rolling stones
Oh, reach the sun oh, reach the sun
Shine bright, shine bright
