[Intro: Sample]
"They stay...
Strange ways..."

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Wreak havoc, beep beep it's mad traffic
Sleek and lavish people speaking leaking to the maverick
He see as just another felony drug arrest
Any day could be the one he pick the wrong thug to test
Slug through the vest, shot in the street
For pulling heat on a father whose baby's gotta eat
And when they get hungry, it ain't shit funny
Paid to interfere with how a brother get his money
Now, who's the real thugs, killers and gangsters?
Set the revolution, let the things bust and thank us
When the smoke clear, you can see the sky again
There will be the chopped off heads of Leviathan

[Interlude: Sample and MF DOOM]
My friend, they call 'em strangers
Anybody talk to him end up in some danger
"They stay...
Strange ways..."
Can't reform 'em

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
They pray four times a day, they pray five
Who ways is strange when it's time to survive
Some will go of they own free will to die
Others take them with you when they blow sky high
What's the difference? All you get is lost children
While the bosses sit up behind the desks, it cost billions
To blast humans in half, into calves and arms
Only one side is allowed to have bombs
It's like making a soldier drop his weapon
Shooting him, and telling him to get to stepping
Obviously, they came to portion up his fortune
Sounds to me like that old robbery/extortion

[Interlude: Sample and MF DOOM]
"They stay..."
Same Game
"Strange ways..."
Ya can't reform 'em

[Outro: Sample]
...that Mary was goin' around with an old flame
That burned me up, because I know he was just feeding her a line!
But the guy really spent his money like water
I think he was connected, so I left
Outside it was raining cats and dogs
I was feelin' mighty blue... and everything looked black
But I carried on!
