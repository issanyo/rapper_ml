[Intro]
Peace
Yo
Peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace
Pow

[Verse 1]
Grey-scale composer living in black and white
With a chain mail ogre that's just as vivid as afterlife
I've pre-seen it
The priests lead the acolytes, to see demons
Now I'm here
Born of the three winged-beast
Where the troll is live it up
Scene fiend, fig trees, scrolls
Hella villainous
Team D street but we killing it
Illest shit
Sick, cooped up, come vanilla chicks
Who you think you dealing with?
Get it right
Whip white instead of black, really the same price
Your soul
I had epiphanies of chilling
Smoking Buddish remedies
With enemies and drinking Ciroc out large cylinders
Ball like krill and we stop the heart
Feeling the shock, no hard feelings, forgot my arch nemesis
Stop and watch the smart pendulum clock the dark ending and optics far primitive
Skip, jump, then hop through the millennia
Her big rump, got me hot as mid summer
Got fam that have seen more crack than a plumbers back
Stat status seems hazmat, what a bummer
Sixteen making more noise than the thunder
Decoys bring ploys, scream "Oi"
But don't wonder what it is

[Verse 2]
He drink from the chalice but he cling to the Shaolin
Sedated, cause the life he leads is a mystery
Now everybody else but the team looking shifty
How late is the dream of a teen just to simply bow
Down to the fate of the gypsies
Foul play leave them gripping
For the J's and the K's
But the laze leave them stiff-ty
Lane looking like he dazed and encased in a trippy
Can't pray to them empty clouds
Pause
Sit back let it simmer in
All black
Just hacked Invader Zimmerman
Bashed the fact
Ring in clacks with faded Timberlands
Suspect like ex-preds with dated liquorice
Puff hectic we sketched the hated victim
It's enough sex to contest with Wilt Chamberlain record
Poetic for like reading in excerpts
We experts comparing style to black wet dirt
Never catch feelings we're known to tell them fetch first
Rap game [?] drones embellished neck first, Chester
Only as know as relics, sick as Capone
His head is barely screwed on but always tell them what it is
