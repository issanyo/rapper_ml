Owww
Yeah
Uh-Huh

[Verse 1]
I wonder how my paixão story begins
I do I separate myself from the rest
How do I speak from the soul within
I was running out of ideas until I met you

[Hook 1]
Meu bem
I think I love you
Meu bem
I think might be in love but I'm not too sure
I think I love you

[Bridge]
Pay attention as she takes the lead
Capture the moment, hold still and freeze

[Verse 2]
There so much that could be said
Truth be told there's not much to be seen
Honestly you're like a beautiful actress
Taken from a page off a magazine
It's no script, I don't pretend
And little Pedro thinks you're beautiful
I'm not speaking of same girl I pose with
Oh the latency isn't love but death

[Hook 2]
Meu bem
Eu amo Ela
Meu bem
Mas eu acho que eu a amo também
I think I you love

[Bridge 2]
You see old girl took the lead
Now understand why I feel guilty

[Verse 3]
Now I think i love you
No, I'm positive I do
Because I miss you
I begin to question where every went wrong
Was it from those constant bothering thoughts?
Or the unbearable songs?
I don't know but now you got up and took off
So I  need to retrace my steps
And retrieve what I've lost
Minha musa onde esta você?

[Break]

This makes you wanna grab a glass of sangria with some cachaça and sip it slow, You know?

[Skit]
I think I have a problem

[Beat Change]


[Hook]
Yeah I can't watch myself
Uh yeah I can't stop myself
A Mulher, Senhora
Por que eu te adoro?
Uh I can't watch myself
Uh yeah I can't stop myself
A Mulher, Senhora
Por que eu te adoro?

[Verse 4]
As move through the groove with Gaúcho pace
Get your cleats on and tie up your lace
I display how I Jogo on a beautiful taste
That's straight from the plate off of Bahia state
Agradeço que a moça bonita I met a year ago
Intimidation is the worst cuz it derails ya flow
I'm off my trail and this caught up in the mix of an identity crisis
I got jungle fever her gingada  took the lead

[Outro]
A Mulher, Senhora
Por que eu te adoro?
Uh I can't watch myself
Uh yeah I can't stop myself
Audience I'm self-destruct
So break the fourth wall
I need your help
