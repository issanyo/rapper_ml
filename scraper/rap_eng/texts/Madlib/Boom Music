[Hook]
Hit the stereo in an instant
And then I twist up a bud light an incense" X5
Bump the Boom Music 'cuz I found a fat L nine times out of ten I use it to start this way

[Quasimoto]
Hey yo Madlib
(Who ME?)
Ya, why don't you hit em up with that high speaking?

[Verse 1: Madlib]
I gets high and start taking out wax selections
First by electin' EricB for president
Zulu Nation for protection
Tribe Called Quest, KRS One secret Hip Hop Intelligence
Diamond D and the whole DITC
Ultramagnetic MC's
Gang Starr doing a show for free and you can smoke sensi
Lord Finesse teaching rhyme telepathy
Biz Markie did a cover for The P Is Still Free
Back when style was the name belt buckles and Lee's
Boomers, Sticky green trees

[Hook]
Hit the stereo in an instant
And then I twist up a bud light an incense" X5
Bump the Boom Music 'cuz I found a fat L nine times out of ten I use it to start this way

[Madlib]
Hey yo Quas hit em with that green talk

[Verse 2: Quasimoto]
Oh I get high and start taking out wack niggas
Then fly up into the sky and use my lyrics as a trigger
Always Pull It , let the bullet slide through to the left
Went so far undergroud with out diggin ended up in west China
Yo Style sounds like youve been eating some bad vagina
The Unseen you Unclean Niggas mad cause you can't find us
We step, we rep, we comin' out of the gates
We can do it for papes; cause madlib got the beat tapes
Lord Quas in the end; always win the sweepstakes

[Hook]
Grip the stereo in an instant
And then I twist up a bud light an incense" X5
Bump the Boom Music 'cuz I found a fat L nine times out of ten I use it to start this way
