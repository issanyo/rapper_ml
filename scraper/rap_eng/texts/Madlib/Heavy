{"Heavy" - *echoes*}

[J Dilla]
Weigh a ton in this m'uhfucker
("Heavy heavy heavy heavy..." *echoes*}
Yeah, heavy bass hittin, from heavyweighters
Heavy cake gettin, it's heavy player
Every day, another buck, another hustle
Cakin up, rake in ducks by the busloads
Wakin up, gotta go for the gusto
Ain't shit up but showin how to touch mo'
All day the show we chase dough
Gotta bankroll thick like the dutch stank roll
MAN UP~! My real niggas stand up, let's get
("Heavy heavy heavy heavy..." *echoes*}
And chase that fetti
Get big faces, let's get ready
("Heavy heavy heavy heavy..." *echoes*}
So heavy, so cold
Might wanna grab that Pelle already it's
("Heavy heavy heavy heavy..." *echoes*}
Can't lift it up
Dilla Dawg, Madlib 'bout to pick it up

[J Dilla]
Get it up, smoke with me weed mayne
How them greens layin, twist it and puff
Heavy smoke from the spliff in the truck
Steady tokin it, I ain't lifted enough, this real
("Heavy heavy heavy heavy..." *echoes*}
Heavy off the chronic, straight bubonic
Blaze if you got it
("Heavy heavy heavy heavy..." *echoes*}
Can't lift it up
Dilla Dawg, Madlib 'bout to pick it up
And put it down like no other
You ain't never heard real live shit, only clones of us
Better learn and beware of the firm
So hot, play it loud, might get a burn
You get it right and you might get your turn
If not, as far as I am concerned
I'm here to take it back while I make a stack
And shut it down for them muh'fuckers fakin jacks

[Hook]
It's real
("Heavy heavy heavy heavy..." *echoes*}
Ready for the streets
Turn it up, go heavy on the beat this
("Heavy heavy heavy heavy..." *echoes*}
Ready for the streets
Turn it up, go heavy on the beat this

[J Dilla]
Yeah gimme that Big Mac shit, go heavy on the gator
With the supersized shake for the haters
Mad Dilla, or combo #1
Knock 'em out the box like Apollo did in I
To Mini-Mes all that followin is done, it's 'bout to get
("Heavy heavy heavy heavy..." *echoes*}
Just like the piece on the chain
That swings in the Jeep with the bang it's
("Heavy heavy heavy heavy..." *echoes*}
Can't lift it up
Dilla Dawg, Madlib 'bout to pick it up
All my live bitches drop it like it's hot bitch
Booty wigglin and wobblin while you pop it
All that ass in your Ashley Stewarts
That's just how McNasty do it
Heavy, mo' heav' than Heav' D
Rockin the chain to make 'em envy
It's still Frank-N-Dank and then me
Collab'n with mad to bangin MC's

[Hook]

[J Dilla]
