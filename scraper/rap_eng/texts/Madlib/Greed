[Hook x3]
That'll be the reason why you bleed for greed
Ready to diss your own brother at break neck speed

[Verse 1 : Grand The Vis]
That's getting played out, how many clowns must I layout?
Before you realize real skills never die
Everybody got dreams of making cash money
To have a mansion and a yacht, to drive a 190E
But you're dissin' all of those who showed you loyalty
You're payin' hoes for spendin' time, buyin' Hennessy
You're never thinking of the issues of community
Flashy idiots are destined to be casualties
Treachery is all I see and it's a god damn shame
We go from arms of slavery to carrying  brand new chains

[Hook x3]
That'll be the reason why you bleedfor greed
Ready to diss your own brother at break neck speed

[Verse 2 : Quasimoto]
I keep it movin', I'm tryna build a future for my seed
While petty niggas killin' for greed
I'm tryna get this money and weed
Then stay positive 'cause I wanna live
While niggas tryna act like they ready to die, I'm getting high
Tryna map out my plans
Keep it on the low for some niggas always runnin' their mouth
(Jabbin yo jaw?) nigga its tapping yo jaw
Tryna get what I got, get [?]

[Hook x3]
That'll be the reason why you bleedfor greed
Ready to diss your own brother at break neck speed
