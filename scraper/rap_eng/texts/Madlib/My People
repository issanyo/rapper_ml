Intro (spoken):

I'm a bad motherfucker, and I don't mind dying...
Pure dynamite!

Song:

My people, hold on. (chanted during the entire song)

Through the thunder and lightning
Ooh, the weather gets rough now
Ooh you got to hang on now girl
When it gets real rough, rocky and windy
Hold on
On and on and on now
When they start throwin' fire
Chant chant chant you down now
Oh you got to hold on and on
Ooh you got to hold on now
Oh you got to climb closer now - now
Who wants to survive now
Aah.. you gotta hold on now
Love is on the way
Love is on the way
Love is on the way ooh
Don't let it go now
Oh even when your heart starts bleeding
Hands on the trigger now, y'all
Right now my brothers and sisters
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on moving on (Repeat until end)
