[Verse 1:]
Simpletons
Sense some simple friends
Sensitive has never been simple sense
My emotion
Mixed some devotion
Potent to the words spoken
Never choking on the mic
Yea, I be flowing
Like water
But never watered down
Sounds nice
I'll have another round
Ice never ever found heights
Into my life
Little more room to keep my sound tight
Catch the irony
OJ, so you know I'm filled with iron g
I guess I'm guilty
Hands a little filthy
Then again there's innocence the glove had never fit g
Guilty Simpson run the rap stampede
Never getting tired because my canteen
Filled with Kevin Gates formula
Or of the same stuff Michael Jordan used to stay more than a
Mere being because when the supreme team
Of Mon Stars in ya beam
Then ya proceed onward
It's like commerce traded in the dress shoes for converse
Chuck Taylors and some dickies long white tees keep it calm first
Kick a bomb verse
Kick it with him
State ya business
Hands in the air
If ya with me spit it with me don't even care
And everybody, everybody, let me hear it yea

[Hook:]
(x4)Reg is regular people put ya hands up

[Verse 2:]
See they don't gas me
But you'll never pass me
I got the answers don't believe me dog ask Jeeves
I kick it old school minus having bad knees
I got the bad needs to but thats account of having to live a more complex life
But every article is never even done right
There's some slight
Doubt plain sight
Is where they hang right
In ya face but ignore it out of plain fright
I believe that we still are God's children
Emphasis on children because
You'll never grow up if you dream of making billions
Of dollars that's a little bone chilling
Considering the fact
That these dunnies hustle with rap
To escape the trap
Only to find themselves right back
In the same spot
On the same block
Slang the same rocks
Fear the same cops
There ya go gave you a major in some sociology
I ain't dead yet I expect a full fledged apology
From the system because they said I'd be wilding b
I'm living good the stats said otherwise
I'm cooling with some scholars supposed to be them other guys
