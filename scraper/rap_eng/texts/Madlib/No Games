No jokes, no games, no gimmicks
Jaylib, no beat, but no limit
It's so hot, the n-o-dot, o-n-e
Fo'sho dawg, off the top, we don't sleep
It's all work, no play, get mo' money
And mo' problems; no doubt, but no cake
It's no good, just like these rappers
No hood in 'em, knowing they some actors
The takeover, rap game makeover
It's next year now, yesterday's over
Time for new shit, "What can you do?" shit
Nothing; stick it up the you-know-what and
There's no fake suckas around, by no means
There's no half steppin’ here, you know we
Some nomads, ‘cross the globe, you local
We loco, with Flo-Jo, you so-so
You know what's up like oats, no can do
Can't go for that clone shit, I demand you
Rap cats with no skills, know this:
Jaylib, we ain't taking, no prisoners
We gon set shit off, like LoJack
All night like no doors, dough stacked
There's no way, if no dough, it's no deal
J Dil and Madlib, mo' real
And now you know
But knowing is only half the battle
Until y'all niggas get it together
Just turn up the bass and let ya trunk rattle
