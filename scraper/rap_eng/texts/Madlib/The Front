[Verse 1: Madlib & (Quasimoto)]
(Hey Madlib, what's the word for the day?)
I got to get all this stress off my chest
One of my closest niggas told me he had to get a vest
Some niggas might be rolling up to his rest
Talking about they going to rob him, put his manhood to the test
(Why brothers got to act so scandalous?)
(Mad at us) 'cos we ain't no janitors
Always looking at me smiling, popping off the lip
Asking how much I clock, talking about my grip
Talking about how they saw me in a magazine, "you're looking clean"
(What's up with hooking up my team?) - Man, I ain't got no label

[Hook]
When I ain't around, my name always up in your mouth
Your whole story is fishy like you went down South
Acting like you've been around me before I was paying dues
You'll never know what I've been through until you've been in these shoes (true)

[Bridge]
Everybody want to act like they know
Everybody want to act, fake, front
Triple egos

[Verse 2: Madlib]
Snakes all around my back, trying to see where I at
Suckers acting like they know me
Met them last night and now they're talking about that they my homies
Yo it, always get frustrating when a nigga starts hating
And then be out like Walter Payton
Only see them when they need something
But never ever see them when you need something
That's how it's been so I don't play the fool nigga
You should too, go back to school
Prepare to get used, like honeys on booze, fools
You choose whether you want to lose

[Hook]
But when I ain't around, my name always up in your mouth
Your whole story is fishy like you went down South
Acting like you've been around me before I was paying dues
You'll never know what I've been through until you've been in these shoes (true)

(Now I see) - Just another day, God bless
