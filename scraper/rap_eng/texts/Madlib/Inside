[Hook]

(Inside..) baby I've got to know

[Intro]

You need to listen a little bit
Instead of running your mouth all day
I been trying to tell you

[Verse 1]

Baby, I been trying to tell you for some time now
Music is what's inside now
No longer can I hide now
See this sad clown
Always have his head down
Calling everywhere I go home
A stranger who's all alone
Never let my feelings shown (show)
This is what's inside
I'm dying on the inside
I'm crying it's a real cry
This is what's inside
If you must know
My love for god I can't hide
Sometimes my thoughts get tongue tied
There's a fire on the inside
Drowning out my dark side
There's a war going on
And I'm standing on both sides
And if you must know

[Hook]

[Bridge]

This is what's inside
Been trying to tell you..
Listen again..

[Verse 2]

Baby, I been trying to tell you for some time now
Music is all I have now
No longer can I hide now
See this sad clown
Always have his head down
Calling everywhere I go home
A stranger who's all alone
Never let my feelings known
This is what's inside
I'm dying on the inside
I'm crying it's a real cry
This is what's inside
If you must know
My love for god I can't hide
Sometimes my thoughts get tongue tied
There's a fire on the inside
Drowning out my dark side
There's a war going on
And I'm standing on your side
And if you must know

[Hook]

This is what's inside..

(Unintelligible)
I ain't telling you
It's a waste of time trying to tell you
You don't listen anyways
One day when you listen
You might be a better person
