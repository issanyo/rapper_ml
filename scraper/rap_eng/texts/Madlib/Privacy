[Verse 1: Quasimoto]
I need my own space
But that simple fact, you ain't understand it
Always in my face (That shit's too demanding) Ey!
All you want to seem to do is talk about my personal issues
Take my kindness for weakness and then (?)
I thought we was on some other shit man
You try to cover shit (Talk about that mother shit)
Now I got to change location, got to change numbers
Hidin' out, sittin' back waitin' till' you ridin' out
I thought I told you it was just between me and you
Now you told your boo, and she told too, and they told a few (So on)
Man, you got it mixed up, now I'm in a fix up
Just cuz' your ass needed a quick buck
I said
Let
Me
Be

[Bridge]
Mhmmhmm
Let me be
Let my have my privacy
Let me be
Mhmmhmm
{?}

[Outro]
Come here
You, have, been, a, bad, boy!
Come here
You, have, been, a, bad, boy!
