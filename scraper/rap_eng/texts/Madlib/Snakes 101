[Intro Skit]

[Verse: M.E.D.]
Now witness how the world turns
Bridges burn, brothers on strike, bullets burn, lives took
Rhyme book I write, past times and present
I’m the reflection of hard times and pleasure
For those misdirected by fake thugs or records
Who breath brothers to fail from jail records
I upset the setup, guns bump forever
Young stars done wait up, grave dug
Reason why black sun stuck together
Streets hot when the weather was cold
Old gold, pleasure of soul, prayers carrying hope
Shit’s same in every area code
Get change, see change in every nigga you know
Hold, no rush (uhuh) ‘cause when amongst snakes
Let friends to close is your own mistake
No bling, all you see is the pearly gates, wait

[Outro: Sample and (M.E.D.)]
Oh, jealousy in your insecurities (They pulling me back)
Woe jealousy obey your insecurities (Wait)
Oh, jealousy in your insecurities
(Snakes one-o-one)
