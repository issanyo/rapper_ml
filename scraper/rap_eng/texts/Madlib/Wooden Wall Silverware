[Intro: Rapper Big Pooh]
So I woke up, I went downstairs to the kitchen
Pulled out a thing of milk, some of that lactose free shit
Pulled out on them big ass bowls from the cabinet
Got me one of them big ass spoons, and uh...

This is kettle pop rock, we eat it with the big spoon
Tupperware bowl, stuck a fork in your tune
Let it marinate, don't give it to 'em to soon
Wash my entr√©es down with a blue moon
This ain't a high school after class flow
Even if I make it look easy that's me though
Yeah I need dough, think I can't bake
You ain't never seen how a nigga make cake
This is food for thought, get a plate
When you're seated at my table never say you ain't ate
Or at least been served, I don't do hors devours
Buffet style, I don't take orders
So get enough, get full, take it to the crib
Share something with your peoples or a little kid
When it's gone just remember how a rapper did
Gotta eat like this to live, come on

[Hook: Rapper Big Pooh]

Deep fried down low sweet production pie
Peas in the iPod, side of RJ rice
Mashed Madlib, smoke some of that killa
Good food, good brews, that's how a nigga feeling
Deep fried down low sweet production pie
Peas in the iPod, side of RJ rice
Mashed Madlib, smoke some of that killa
Good food, good brews, that's how a nigga feeling

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]

This is crack pot gumbo, in it for the fun yo
I've got love for it even when my funds low
Drive slow approach a verse with caution
Bars lined up and they ready for marching
King of the hill, liquor no pills
In vogue at the moment, this is something they could feel
Something they could steal, sleeping on the pill
White tees, black chucks, that's me on the real
Ready, set, action, plenty traction
Never seen me sweat, now you know satisfaction
I hear 'em asking, what's my next move
That's anything I choose, volume one, volume two
Fat boy fresh nigga live from the shop
Chop two peas make it harder to stop
Only got one goal, make it harder to drop
That's a message to the old hands in the new crop

[Hook: Rapper Big Pooh]

Deep fried down low sweet production pie
Peas in the iPod, side of RJ rice
Mashed Madlib, smoke some of that killa
Good food, good brews, that's how a nigga feeling
Deep fried down low sweet production pie
Peas in the iPod, side of RJ rice
Mashed Madlib, smoke some of that killa
Good food, good brews, that's how a nigga feeling
