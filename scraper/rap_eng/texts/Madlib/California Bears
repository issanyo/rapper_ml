[Verse 1]
Naw, probably run the whole city
Parade around this bitch, Walt Disney
All Diddy with it, did he just diss me?
Nigga, please, put that money on a Frisbee, dog
Your applause to a small to play ball
Your arms too small to come hit me
My pitch too grizzly, them niggas with me shoot
With the ru, in the ra, burn the roof
'Bout it in the coupes, fuck taking different routes
To the spa with the broad, but really it's a room
Spoon for the cereal, serial, kill a killa with the illa
My will like Will Smith, nigga get the picture
I feel like Bill Gates, except I look richer
Carry real weight, if not I cook with ya
Pounds on the mound with the crown on fitted
B is for brave motherfucka be a midget
Run funds, like niggas with guns
Might spit if I'm spun, I'm like Lennon with one
Two for piece, three for each piece I brung
Only hanging on my arms 'cause I'm hung

[Chorus]
He's a wrap, he's a sheriff
He can rap, he's embarrassed
But yo, the California Bears is in the building
The California Bears is in, clap it up
He's a wrap, he's a sheriff
He can rap, he's embarrassed
Ay yo, California Bears is in
Spare women and children

[Verse 2]
Pulled up on the curb, sparked the herb
Let loose a few secrets the hood ain't heard
Amazing how a brother can shine with those words
Put the stag nation in action with those verbs
Make 'em bow, put a crown on a noun
Astound by creation, I was found on the Nile
Vowels at a wedding, I-O-U the Earth
Two fouls I beheaded, they was destined for the dirt
Frozen like they never seen a black man pose
Never knew a mountain can be moved with a prose
Legitimate pros, pulled dimension out a Bose
Second I dose, I saw the sphinx with a nose
X's and O's, thought of the ex's that I owe
Never sex with a ho after I exit out a show, but yo, yo, yo

The California Bears is in it
Spare women and children
