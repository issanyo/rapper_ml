[Verse 1: Knowledge] Born as an indigo, spitting flows since three years old and getting told was fucking jokes Had Knowledge Without Taking Notes. Rather chose to lift and float than vanish like I had a cloak im cocky, yeah a chicken knows my raps come back like fiends to coke. Have a funeral for all the pirates rebels migrate divided by loss of thought and those decided, revolutionary Fuck them all live for forgotten fuck the rotten government who's logic must lead up to nonsense. Equal syllables in my rhymes time to hit chimes with niggas who thinking the fucking world is fine but ya'll all blind. And i said it once maybe i should say it twice play the game of death with six dice, but it ain't feeling right. Get the picture back fuck a race no white or black we are proudly equal but the government ain't saying that. Media is stressed full with drugs and lots of sex they enslaving people whats next? I said too much but for the best. Check the mischief though, its so cryptic Charismatic flows got faster since illmatic, Being a bastard can be tragic or a laughter it doesn't matter its a flatter to be master. But im blessed, S on my chest like a super hero vest that detects all the mess, and im moving like a jet when it comes to the checks, balling like I was a god most respect to the nets but... Its east coast, don't never ever doubt it hear the whole world speak about us we ain't dead we just retired, and we came back now your wired commercial rappers are fired we're taking care of the liars and building a whole empire nigga. My flows isn't the best, but ima stay in Brooklyn its my vision of nest, and if you trynna lock me cause im cause of the pests, than take my last name off and replace it with X nigga
