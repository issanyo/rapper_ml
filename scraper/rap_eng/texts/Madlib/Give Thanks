[Verse 1: Napoleon Da Legend]
I'm so thankful for everything I'm thankful I'm alive
I keep repeating to myself I'm thankful I'm alive
I'm thankful for my eyes I'm thankful for my legs
For my ears for my heart for my kidneys for my health
I'm thankful for my friends thankful for my fans
Thankful for this love and I'm thankful for this land
I'm thankful for my drive and I thank all these producers
To my life for inspiration and I'm thankful for the bruises
Thankful for the challenges the obstacles and setbacks
Got to places in my life thought was impossible to get at
Thankful for my mom rest in peace dad my queen and my sister
Disappointment made my rhyme scheme richer
Thankful for the sun cold weather and the hot
Thankful to have a purpose now I'm tethering the knot
Thankful for the jewels Ron Williams and doc's gym
Thankful for the struggle and days I was feeling boxed in
Thankful for the pain the asthma my short stature
I'm thankful for my stutter step I can still blow passed ya
Thankful for clean water I'm thankful for the books
Thankful to artist for these fly verses and hooks
Thankful for my feet thankful for these block I walked
Thankful for the fights thankful for the stitches I caught
Thankful for these stages and the sound man who fix the mic
And give thanks for social media when I get a like
Give thanks to oxygen and all the toxins I purge
And this anxiety I cope by getting lost in the words
Give thanks

[Hook: Napoleon Da Legend]
Today I wanna give thanks
Itâ€™s important to give thanks

[Verse 2: Napoleon Da Legend]
To ya Ls and ya Ws
Going thru hell heavens in front of u still
Only death gives meaning to life like the story Christ
We rose victorious from glorious fights give thanks
To the sun moon and stars who'd a thought
That through the darkness we would manage finding light thru the fog
Give thanks to that plate of food we ate thru we grateful faithful thru these hard times we made it thru
