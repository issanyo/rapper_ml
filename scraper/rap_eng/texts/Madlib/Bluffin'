[Verse 1: Quas]
Quasimoto we keep it on that next shit
Lord Quas Mr. Budha-skeeta,Madlib control the head dip
We doin' volume 2 taking over is a new breed
Takin' out the wack niggas, speaking on hatred and greed
It's universal (what's yo name) Lord Quas yo my verse will
Have em leavin with a stash for some prize money yo a purse full

[Verse 2: Madlib and (Quas)]
Yo you gotta have comprehension for this wack MC convention
Another Madlib invention to get your attention
We comin' from the dungeon lyrical surgeons
Beat heard, splurgin' (We'll open you up like a virgin)
Keep it clean like a public washing machine
Visine for your ears (loud raw be The Unseen)
Ay yo (suckas try to bring it but strickly be bluffin')
(Quasimoto drop jewels on phony niggas actin' rough) ehh

(Sample)
"So tough MC's ain't really saying nothing"

[Hook]
Ay yo suckas try to bring it but strictly be bluffin'
Quasimoto drop jewels on phony niggas actin' rough ehh

(Sample)

[Verse 3: Quasi]
(Whatchu' do)I get deep like fathoms in ocean water
To drown your wack artificial sonata
And all the wack shit, I use ya'll niggas like remotes
And remove you like coats of old paint, you irritatin' like a sore throat
I ain't ... like Yvette Michele
Tell ya'll niggas to freeze 'fore they bite my lyrical shells

[Verse 4: Madlib]
Word to Mr. Budha, ya'll niggas soundin' like intruders
"Yo I remember them niggas from way back
Ya'll niggas ain't gonna shoot us"
I love callin' out you fake so so's on every coast
Some niggas always actin' like hoes

[Verse 5: Quas]
Talkin' 'bout they wanna freestyle but can't even rock a show
Or write a cool song, probably just an average joe blow
On deez nuts, 'cuz I'm coming for ya
Out the lost gates of (sunny Californiaaa)

(Sample)

[Hook]
Ay yo suckas try to bring it but strictly be bluffin'
Quasimoto drop jewels on phony niggas actin' rough ehh
