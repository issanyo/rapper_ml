WOW!
All Caps, she on his lap until his popped cap erupts from the kickback, her knickknack with lips chapped
She was crusty
Tummy musty
From the slush discuss disgusting rumors spread so no one's trusting
Yeah, no one's trusting
Please call me Mr. shades of grey, my mind sprays gamma rays
The heroes pay for all the silly craze
Leave the scummy phage and flow dirty like bees, birdies, surely
Hit him in the temple, Shirley, vision's whirly, gates is pearly
Date from the flirting was a thirty out of thirty
Bumpin' oldies on my cellular phone and roll these schemes to your brethren but, we know that he's a clone
When stones throw, my homes know how it goes when niggas buy these rotten flows and cotton clothes and sloppy hoes is plotting on foes
Because of mua Menage A Trois with one plus one plus one
Thus he cums and slumps the scum
Just for fun, shits and giggles in a pickle never fickle stayed the same
When it rains we counting change it's not a phase the gang will raise, rise up them things sag so get your size chump
Dudes with nothing relate to it, so they pursue this slow movement pay attention to pulpit your foolish
