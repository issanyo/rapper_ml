[Verse 1]
Von Pea from Tanya
Here to give you sucker ducks a reminder
You're green with envy, you're like slime-a
Nigga, get the sand out ya vagina
And if she got a heavy bottom and accepts my mistakes
Like Hillary Rodham
I'ma let her say "I got him!"
This ain't a LP
This ain't a mixtape
I'on really know what to call it other than "great"
If it was '98, you'd be dubbin' the tape
And if Madlib hear it, I'll be catching a case
VonPea.com, but you'on gotta love us, we got moms
Annette, Beverly and Beverly
Now I reach the kids, Linda Ellerbee
I'on rap like this for the whole record
Have some damn patience, time ain't a wastin'
You ain't doin' nothin but sittin' in mom's basement
Talking on iChat, so listen to my raps
It's outta control
So I'm here to take the batteries from out the remote
And switch em
Bitchin'
Listen....I write with energy
BROOKLYN!
Ha ha ha

[Von Pea Talking]
To all the pioneers from '73-'79 to '88 to right now
Well ain't no pioneers right now, but you know what I mean
To everybody I came in the game with in 2001, yeah it's been 7 years
To all the brand new artists right now, one love!
And on that note
Let's get adventurous...
