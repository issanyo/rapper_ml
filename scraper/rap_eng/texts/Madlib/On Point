[Intro: Madlib]
One Time
For your mind
Another invasion

See if y'all catch it
Slow, if not write it out

[Verse 2: Madlib]
Like when it's time to make love, love we love non-stop

We wreckin' up your area, we keep it on lock
To all my niggas, yo we on point
Like my nigga Mr Buddha roll smoke-a-lot
To all them weed heads, we on point

[Hook: Madlib]
To the gold digging niggas with they heart on rocks
To the all the bitches, yo we on point

[Verse 3]
Ayo, people always telling that my shit's hot
Always come correct, yo we on point

For those who don't even know what I said
In the second verse I said
Droppin' hot fashion
Mashin' lyrics lashin' 'n'
Unmasking fake kats in acts smashin' the fact
In one second flat
You could end your career stepping here

Gon' let the beat ride
