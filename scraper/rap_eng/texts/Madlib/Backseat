[Verse 1: Jakob]
Answer both my calls in the backseat
Call connect your girl tellin her to fax me
Your girl is going crazy get a maxi
Pad is where I be now I'm calling up a taxi
And I'll pay tax
Don't forget please
I'll up here sitting at home
With some bomb weed
And don't forget the cardigan
Or there'll be fees
Yet they sending me to college bro
Get a frisbee
Got a beer and blunt
Tricking on my shake junt
Smoke a pack of spirits
And then I'm done for the month
Open wide for
The lunch from your supper
Fuck a bitch with no rubber
Stick my gums with an upper
I'm out here
Tweakin and leakin
Got your girl moaning
And stuttering
Butter thin waffles
And chicken
Bacon in the
Back seat
Heard she like it rough
In the backseat
Just don't forget ya dumb bitch
You can't tempt me

[Verse 2: Jack The Spitter]
I got three fives on it and like a bunch of drugs and alcohol an stuff oh are we recording fuck oh no

In the backseat? fuck that we don't even see streets
Cursing round the city with your girl in my lap see
We getting gross and stupid ugly on ugly
I'm wearing Mishka print undies, and she about to get a bundle b
Oops pardon me, i got off on the tree
And now i'm offing your niece
She in the backseat, neat
On her knees
She be looking sweet
Hope she 18, but i'm 2 years below the legal lean
Fuck i'm a liar, twist the fire in the backseat
Loosen my tie after the ride, in the backseat
Taken away from the situation in the backseat
Boost me up, bitch i can't see, bitch what you hiding?
Riding dirty just took another damn level
When she hit another treble's when i hit the road forever
I'm a bastard i'm a father, probably had a daughter
Never got in the backseat, fiction is better than truth tellers motherfucker
And i'm just playing we were safe
Seat belt on, our hands in place
Her dad was driving, i got embarrassed
And asked about her weekend and shit fuck
She went ice skating and saw we're the millers

[Verse 3: Jakob & Jack]
(Spending all my writing, never looking back
Mind be like a meth lab i'm done and breaking bad)
Tired of the bias, back to back i'm finna crash
Cabbies crabby with the panties flying all over the pad
(i'm going mad, had, her dying for cash
Sucking dick while i just here and rap)
I just rap, fucking trash, coming out of my jaw, kissing all up on her flaws
Let her know, all in all, i'm done fucking around with these bras
(i'm out in aw, bringing order to my flaws
Could give a fuck on what i'm on, kush louder than operah)
You ain't shitting with the zen, men, chill as shit with ten friends
Soon we'll all be dead for a second tying loose ends (in the backseat)
(got so much money they could envy)
And now leachers claiming they really always been with me?
