[Verse: MF DOOM]
I'd like to start off by thanking our sponsor
For financing the parts for this Frankenstein monster
Along with my partner who's a bro of few words
We did this research for true nerds and two birds

Piano
Do a show, same time watch it
And guaranteed to give 'em more than just hock spit
MC extraordinaire, technique sort of rare
Caught a glare, sure to scare, next week more to share
From the most retarded-est artists this year and forever
Villain 'nem, the mean big brothers love ya
Definitely felonies, telling me
Treacherously MC, yelling B, set 'em free
Let me see, that strategy's misleading
G's all in the freezer with the batteries and Z-Rims
He, him stalked the concrete with bunion
And won't hurt corns when it's on like the stun gun
*tsssst* Not so shocking
Funyun faced rappers eat rocks, over beatboxing
Debunk punks with a stock flow
And make it funky fresh with no socks for hocko
Madvillain been as high as Kathmandu
And tilted to the side like that fat man's shoe
Look, not to give a mixed signal
The rap game got more toys than Kris Kringle
And he's fake, yer ears is not deceiving
I can't believe my eyeballs no more than "Steveland"
No wonder, OMFG
Snuck him like an unexpected blow from a lefty
Caught me, almost shot a eye out
Felt good though, even with the cotton dry mouth
Time out
Okay, time back in
Never seen a living human being with black skin
What's crackin'? Besides smoking trees and wheezing
With no reason working like a broken tetrahedron
He get paid and get even
Building, still get mad when it's time to get v-vanim
They thought the Don had gone silent
Since deep in his studies he's accepted non-violence
Don't make him have to skip some classes
And open up an old can of whoop-ass with the fastness
Cut the raw with melatonin put a little more in
Strip club full of whores and grown men snoring
Keep the block sown like Thread and Bobbin Bonus
And make sure the seeds know they'd never ever own this
Beat a dead pony and sell the corpse for glue
Get a portion off the proceeds for the shoe
No need to bleed if there’s no big to do
Flew a fly flow with the speed of Mr. Magoo
Blew a wad on a platinum card debit
Come back broke as hell ask the god for credit
Dead it
The mask is like a hand crafted ghillie suit
Only if the ladies could see him they’d say he's really cute
Hmm, thanks in advance
Don’t try to be cool now had ya chance
Avalanche
Rappers is Bagger Vance acting
Who need to fix they pants or get smacked by the Mac 10
Or 11, or both
Find Jesus, see the reverend take the oath
He moves his huge hands in the dark like fate
Waitin' for the date to drop the tape like bait
