[Verse 1: Lord Fuego]
Young SPF you get no shine
Everything is I spit is positive just like a proton
Jimmy neutrons get they top popped back
At the liquor store where all the goonies like to slang crack
And all the sumchins make assumptions that we got Glocks
But all we really got the same sumchins on our black cocks
And time will tell, reading time in hotels, I'm flowing like a gazelle, trying to run from Adele
Third eye shit
We puffin heavy bong rips
You keep talkin shit, hit you in the mouth with Palm hits
No smacks, shit is wack, that shit balognie
I got your main bitch Ridin round on a pony
I don't pack heat
So sorry no Mack please
You and every other rapper out here tryna match me
Tryna match me
Tryna tryna match my steez
Every single word spoke to your girl I match with my skeet
Led posion and it don't come from a pencil
It come from a zinger bullet ain't tryna be gentle
Hide you in the lentil
I ain't oriental
But the kush blunt keep your boy from going mental

[Verse 2: Lord Fuego]
And it's evident that niggas seeking evidence that I'm the president of this rap shit and I'm heaven sent
Third eye intelligence
Sus niggas irrelevant
I'm smoking heavy so I see planets and purple elephants
I'm a villain
Sell drugs to children
Fuck up a lost civilian
I'm praying I'll reach a million
I'm killin' these little kittens and spitting pure penicillin
So when you in my vicinity better know who you dealin wit
