Chorus:

Hey yo, how many know about crate diggin'?
What does crate diggin' mean to me?
Diggin' for them unordinary soundin' loops
Even if it's not clean to thee

Diggin' in these crates for a phat remix
Diggin' in these crates for a phat remix

[Madlib]
Hey yo, diggin' in these crates for a phat remix
Leave you waiting for a skit of this shhhhh
Niggas talking bout they kickin' raw type flavor
But it ends up coming out wick wick wack
Got a phat stack of loops off my grandpappy
For a buck got the phat skit
Take it back home, show my niggas, loop it up
Smoke a blunt cuz they say that be the ish

Chorus:

Hey yo, how many know about crate diggin'?
What does crate diggin' mean to me?
Diggin' for them unordinary soundin' loops
Even if it's not clean to thee

[Madlib]
Down in San Francisco to New Orleans
Lookin' for the dopest loops to sympte
Lookin' at these high ass prices, my nigga
Tells me to back ish don't tempt me
Cuz the last time I got caught up in that game
I bagged so much shit, I put that store to shame

Chorus:

Hey yo, how many know about crate diggin'?
What does crate diggin' mean to me?
Diggin' for them unordinary soundin' loops
Even if it's not clean to thee

[Madlib]
I got CD's in my crates, like crack in my pocket
Yeah right, neither of the above
So when you see a nigga straight puttin' his ends for beats
You'll give the real niggas that homey love
Never Top 40, just that raw addict vintage
That I kick with the rest of my archives, live
When I'm out shopping like a Beat Junkie
I always take the herb to the chest
