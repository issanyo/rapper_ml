Now it's time you head out and understand
It's a one night stand, take care like Graham
R to the I to the muthafucking P
This is what I do fuck up MP3s
And I might just break ya damn MPC
I'm harder to get than a PhD
Osyris, you will always bow to my highness
This God is very real, this shit is Aquinas
You ain't flexing on ya joints you got Arthritis
While I'm nasty like a bitch that got Hepatitis
Hardened like LeBron James word is bond
And nobody else gonna stop this boy Hasan
Call me Genghis Khan, though I'm from Pakistan
This big guppy need the cream through these Ponds
Huh, who the fuck put you on?
They need to X you out poppin' up stay calm
Speaking of Ex, she gassed up tho she gone
Can somebody tell me what my ex on?
Being Gassed gonna blow but she ain't bomb
Only women that I love be my sisters and mom
Want, wide, wank three Ws rom
But never on the period I'm still gon com
Trilingual, your girl be a steal for my steelo
Woh kehti rehti hai ke mujhe bhi cheenlo
Voy a robar tu novia, prometo
Elle est a moi maintenant is my credo
Excuse my french, but the shit ain't finished
I ain't even going hard, man this shit is like scrimmage
I dare one of y'all to try and diminish
I'm a mothafucking flame waiting to be extinguished
Style vintage, yet I'm so distinguished
Calling anybody out either die or witness
Either talk or listen, be a cure to this sickness
But it just won't happen, like O Donnell and fitness
Phil Jackson of this, can't you see a pattern
I'm a big fish tho I bully lakes in caverns
Land lord of this court maybe you should attorn
And I ain't stoppin' till I got more rings than Saturn
Wear more rings with passion, wear more than Kardashian
Bars be the bullets, beat is Sniper in action
While I'm slashing and holding it as the assassin
In about 3 seconds say what up to Jackson
Cause I'm Michael in 95, but alone on this team
Scotty Pippen was the beat but I killed em with a scream
I'm supreme like Hakeem in his prime doing screens
Fucking East feel me coming hard like Irene
Back to MJ though, but not Jackson or Jordan
I'm Magic Johnson with Kareem combined in a portion
Or maybe Mick Jagger, rolling stones for fortunes
I'm Michael J McFly to the future I'm shortened
I don't smoke Mary Jane, rope the dope like Foreman
But I get em like Tiger, royalty like Gordon
I'm important, like that Richard Nixon recording
Cause I'm the truth like a holy book assortment
Leave you trail blazing, like the boy from Portland
This MP3's a virus to a rapper fuck your Norton
Oh you outta this world? Well I'mma give you a deportment
Then get my lips sponsored with your girl's endorsement
Green is there for me, but I don't need no friends
So tell Rachel to keep coming over again
If you real come and get me cause I'mma ascend
On the way up tho I swear careers gon' end.. Mic drop
