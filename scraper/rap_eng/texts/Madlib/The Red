[Intro: J Dilla]
Yeah, man, you hear that? You here that shit, man?

[Verse 1: Madlib]
Y'all niggas like, "What the fuck is this?"
Damn, look at this, what kinda luck is this?
Uh, Madlib and Dilla is the illest, my nigga
Only haters holla, they can't feel us
Niggas wanna get looser then we?
But just gon' be a loser to me and Dilla
Killa, talkin' 'bout how you peal caps, but nigga
You softer than a pillow
Backslapin' ya neck while you covered in rep
'Cause you bluffin' and you ain't said nothin' to spec (that nigga always lyin') (hey, pass the weed)
Anyway I'm straight high off the trees
Your girl don't wanna lie, she just wanna get on her knees
Turn it up, y'all niggas must be outta ya head
If your system ain't up to the red

[Bridge: J Dilla]
Yo, what was that you said right there, what was that?

[Verse 2: Madlib]
It's the leeway, instant replay, instant relay
Instant MC, producer, and DJ
I do this shit without a cell beeper or 3-way
You're comin' off like like a gilet (anyway)
Ay, peace to A.G, peace to Pete Rock
Diamond D, peace to Seiji (oh shit, look over there)
Yo, that nigga's wild like wildlife animals
Hannibal, cannibals (whoop, what else?)
Um, male fascists, womanizers
Nymphos, niggas in disguises (ay, watch out! What else?)
Fine women that like pretty women, some ass women
Some titty women (mostly shitty women)
Y'all niggas must be outta ya head
If your system ain't up to the red
