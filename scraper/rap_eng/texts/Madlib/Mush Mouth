This time Imma crack the pencil
Illustrate the iller fates of wack ass stencils
Game in a box like I play Nintendo
No drink
I smoke
I fuck up endo
Yo, fuck that club rather roll the endo
Know my ends low
Hit my venmo
Chillin with a shorty, an admitted nympho
Tryna watch a show but it looks so minstrel
Feel that vibe over instrumental
Don't trim no leaves, backwood extendo
Said you been about it, Where your product been though?

Bass cranked up but your dope ain't loud
Kush so loud that it hushed the crowd
Jay so loud that it hushed the crowd
I said Jay so loud that he hushed the crowd
Goddamn

(You said the reefer??)

It seems you love to hate
The only way
You never think about it
Write a spell
And spit it well
For you to shake your body
Stabbing nails
Into my sails
You niggas wave riding
Imma get your head bobbing
All my flows symphonic
I'm an airplane pilot (???)
