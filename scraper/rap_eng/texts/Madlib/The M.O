[Verse 1]
My dog's barking while bitches walking
Like can you blame us?
That same attitude splatter dudes when Iraq invade us
Attack the map, re-verbal gats murder impersonators
Verses shameless, serving perfect strain
This is that birthing major
Christ comparisons, Holy Trinity scarin' 'em
Turnin' virgins to [?]
Burning bridges and marriages
Highway robbery
Ain't nobody on top of me
Taking pictures of bodies
My victims, I did 'em casually
Don't feel nothing no more when I be seeing casualities
Don't listen to critics unless they wanna battle me
Yeah, fuck them bitches
They can catch fade like Megatron
Forever on, that severed arms
We never on no function
Well, I'm stuck in substances
Hardly able to function
Lunch is a bunch of color
I flutter above in public
Bustin' outta these dungeons
A rapper magic like magic from the past
We dashin' when the police react
Pull that pin, throw the grenade (uhh)
(Uh huh) The boys in town
Live my life with a poison crown
Jesus thought [?] them demons deceiving
[?] need a cathedral to learn
These rappers you reppin' are dead already
Leave 'em to burn
We seeking the perfect words to speak to a beat and verse
Make the world tweet about it like earth was a blue bird
Jump to the moon or Jupiter
Grasp the globe at it's curvatures
I put it on my back like I'm Atlas
Fit the world in 'em
We spitting with a purpose
Pull the strap to seal your purses (Voltron)
Put you in a hearse, and make ya curl at the cervix (Voltron)
Shook you on your curfew, acting cool on the surface (Voltron)
Push you to the curb, and crack your skull, you should be nervous (extremely nervous)
We handle shit, abandon ship
It's a stereo vandalist
Our shit stay in your system for weeks like cannabis
Animus heavy [?]
Rolling that Chevy, douche-rider
Crew rhymers do damage
We gettin' gettin' goats like Chupacabra (ergh)

[Outro]
The first sensation may be felt instantly after having smoked so fast, or an hour after having eaten. Usually you creep slowly [?] sliding upwards [?]
The effects may come upon you suddenly and strike you full force in the middle of a word
