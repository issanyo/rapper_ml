[Common]
Letters from prison sayin' we need a better religion
I'm a rebel that listens from a eighty-seven position
I can't crystalize the mission lies within
Born to die even in death we begin
It's heavy 'jo learnin what we already know
And carry low swing on a chariot slow
Brothers stick though remindin' me of revolution
If the drama comes I'ma have to uhh pop his gun
It's the Sun God

Everywhere is broken glass
Nephews smokin' squares, nieces smokin' grass
Try not to say shoot around my daughter she already know to blast
Catchin' the future, don't know who threw the past
It's the, year of the snake and the hidden dragon
Niggas is fake like bitches braggin'
Listen to the ocean and the stars, keep my vision in motion
In motion like cars
I'm down to Earth, at times I feel closer to Mars
The world is yours, I'm hopin it's ours
Some say the Gods is crazy, I see God in our babies
Child of the sun, I allowed it to raise me
(From a distance) niggas tried to appraise me
I'm hard to read like graffiti so it don't phase me
My days be spent, behind dream's tent
Through the sun the divine being is sent
It's the Sun God
