[VERSE 1:DopeNOSE]

Ski mask steady robbing the bank
They see a skinny nigga that smell like he puff the stank
Im the international super thief
Im known from the under world to the choral reef
Shitting on your lyrics your flow is fuck garbage
You drop the autotune i drop that hard bar shit
I rape your words call me the booty warrior
Not a savior of music just raps destroyer
Fucking your daughter after the first date
I can last 4 an hour dont wait up late

[VERSE 2:DopeNose]
I have the book that plants your demise
You can go to the lake or up to the skys
The culprit the nigga in dope vans
The rebels is coming up better call your mans
Some say the spawn of satan
Others say deaths fucking replacement
14 was raised in ohios underworld
Dont bring up my ex shes the cottonheaded demon girl
Disrespect ski mask get your penial gland ripped out
U shoulda know better b4 u opened your damn mouth

[VERSE 3:DopeNose
CLOSER TO MUHFUCKING DEATH
THIS AINT CRACK ROCK MUSIC IM SERVING THE CRYSTAL METH
AND THE OXY OF COTTON
BITTER SWEET DREAMS POISONED DOWN TO ROTTEN
