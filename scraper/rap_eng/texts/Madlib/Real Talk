[Intro: Declaime]
My title is Declaime for past the weak
We about to toss this microphone around with my homeboys
LMNO and M.E.D
‘Cause that’s how we do, that’s that funk

[Verse I]

[Declaime]
My man, Kankick, hate to say it, but he knew best
Give these fake arns and wack duck labels a rest
Watch these lame ducks suck suede like they were zest
Plaque ass jacks can’t get the Crest

[LMNO]
No artist, no label, simple as that
Execs payed off the sweatshirt on your back
Put in a cut, get a cut, it’s money on track
Until they recoup theirs, the money line’s flat

[M.E.D.]
I don’t do rap, rap doing me for the Gs
But they sayin’ quiet mouths don’t eat
I’m tryin’ to stay humble, but they’re bringing out the beast
Instead of handsome fee, we heard him over beats
Success is a weapon and it’s deadly when we speak that
I’m a grown man, I don’t blame who repeat that

[Chorus: Sample]
I don’t get involved with he said she said
So take my advice and quit while you’re ahead
I don’t get involved with he said she said
So take my advice and quit while you’re ahead
Don’t stop to ask, don’t do such things
Take my advice and quit while you’re ahead
I don’t get involved

[Verse II]

[LMNO]
Spark when the verse turns
Giving it a run for its money, I’m no cash dummy
A charger, filling up the battery pack
Glad to be back where I never left, cherish every breath
Tell’em cut the check later for the cake
That doesn’t clear debt, not a snapper neck threat
But don’t test the bless unless

[M.E.D.]
You was fresh enough to understand correct
That I’m a leader, who never do with y’all respect
I express next shit for the extra check
Till we expand, we connect like X-Men
L.M.D., hundred proof from the scam that be

[Declaime]
I pay more dues to slave hands
But, no we don’t band, just two turntables and a mic, alright
One mission, changeup my aim, don’t waste no more ammunition
Hideous talking, precise decision, each incision cuts deep
Wake up and don’t sleep

[LMNO]
Indeed I choose this path, the math doesn’t always add up
Advances only mean you have to catchup
The glitz and glamor and shifty scam
Ignoring the star you are is part of the plan

[M.E.D.]
Employing the awkward is just part of demand
Industry ain’t running the game, it’s the fans
Labels keep fading away, tell’em
You can kill the body, but the soul remains

[Chorus: Sample]
I don’t get involved with he said she said
So take my advice and quit while you’re ahead
I don’t get involved with he said she said
So take my advice and quit while you’re ahead
Don’t stop to ask, don’t do such things
Take my advice and quit while you’re ahead
I don’t get involved
