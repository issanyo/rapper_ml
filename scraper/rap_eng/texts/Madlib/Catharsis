Man I'm sicker than pneumonia
Rhymes is more dangerous than plutonium
Spread the sodium
Flows be rare like euphoria
And I'm informing ya
Superman my kryptonite gonna corner ya
Release petroleum
And have the president up on the podium
Saying that I'm the eco system killer
Go figure
The nice kid finally considered
To deliver longer than Gerhard Mitter
Well here's Peter
Pouring ether up by the liter
With heat seekers
So take a rest just like The Meters
Who can defeat us
I'll rip the show and then you sweep up
Told you to keep up
You can't compare to me y'all teacups
Pigs squealing to other pigs about me
Don't you got heat And blow weed
Wassup man don't blame me
I'm just me I can't be tamed screw Siegfried
And Roy too ay dios mio man y'all obsolote
Monopoly better pay up the fee my property
Is this game and there's no way your goons can come and cheat
I'm hard to beat
Got these hypocrites wanting these feats
Word to Cap Steez
AmeriKKKa's Korruption been reloaded
They've been decoded
The message it been eroded
I'mma threat to anyone breathing
That's why they have it so devoted
To make sure I fail in here and eat dust
You got guts but do you really have em whats your truss
Inform us tell me in face that I'm nuts
You won't cause you a zombie to society on drugs
You on boss the God almighty is upon us
Yeah right floss enjoy it while you can my pen draws
Back and paints a picture you call it scripture
Go watch your temper Mr.Fisher you can picture this motion picture
I'm the sum of all fears the difference is
The product that I'm getting from this problem divides this
So called competition into nothing, gone's my opponent
They like last I heard Peter left them hanging like exponents
The diamond in the rough that somebody has found
Been through the rough and tough times you visualize my sound
Bound to be considered one of the greatest to ever live
I'm gone but you know I'm gonna live forever
