[Verse 1: Menace]
Its sniffle season
Gets you so high your nose bleeding
So cold my piss freezing
Misinterpreting get you mistreated
Ya bish screaming cause my wrist reaming
Pull the rollie out her ass hole
Put you donkeys in ditches call em ass holes
Feeling froggy get turned to a tadpole
Send you up stream now cry me a river
Take one sip and explode ya liver
We don't distill you a lame if you diss still
We just instill when we lift this steel
Pop pistols or pop pills
Cause you gone need them painkillers
We trained killers
Guerrillas not talking manilla
Ray sees our future but
Hellen Keller couldn't feel us

"Yeah that last bar was weak, I know"

[Verse 2: Menace]
A patient has to be patient
While waiting on mastermind
With master rhymes
I master mine
With a mass of time
With the mask of mine
POW! This a stick up
I get rid of ya hiccups
Always was last in a pick up
Its OK though
Play with my word play like playdoh
Ion play though
Call me plato
Feel this philosophy
Jacking up these commas, apostrophes
My father wasn't fatherly
Didn't bother to bother me
Till I hit the lottery
Felt like he was apart of me
But still didn't exist like the basement of an apartment see
Don't want an apology
Got enough from pharmacies
Just know you were an absentee
Stuck there like the caps in knee
Just want to knock yo teeth out get rid of them cavities
Cut the sweet talk
Its just poppycock
I hope you get molliwopped
You alcoholic drink a molotov
Turn to ash
Thats kind of rash
I feel bad for the MASH
They had to save your ass
... I don't want cash
