I hear you loud and clear

[Verse 1]

Cause I'm a thief that breaths heat, a deep heathen
X-Hood, complete freak for no reason
No visa. Ice cold freezer
Rightful, spiteful, I'm so evil
People
I understand hatred
Sudden glance, study that hundred grand spaceship
Back to being single mingling without a face lift
Without a dime or watch, no bracelet. Basic
Didn't seem to bother her
My heart was being fastened
Cited cause I knew that it was boater than the last one
Half done
Have to make the next quarter of the next half blast off like NASA
Nascar
Vespa instead of fast car
Loft instead of mansion
Awfully good at dancing
Hot and sweaty hold hands and walk dog through moss and wooded branches
Probably should advance it
Would of been, could have been, should have been
Fuck these haters. Grab they mouth and put my foot in it

My life, my life's half over
To tell you the truth
I don't, I don't even care anymore

[Hook]
I can't stop the pain
Can't stop the rain
Can't stop the shame
Can't stop these things, runnin' through my brain
Cause I'm goin' insane
I can not explain, but I'm exhausted

I can't stop the pain
Can't stop the rain
Can't stop these things, runnin' through my brain
I can not complain, but I lost the fame
My life is down the drain, Because I lost it
