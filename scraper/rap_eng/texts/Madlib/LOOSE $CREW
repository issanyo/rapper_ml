[Verse]
People telling lies 'til they believe it themselves
It seems to me like they got a problem with being themselves
They ain't gone realize until they out here burning in hell
It's just like Earth, except you see the fire is playing right now
The music hits your spine like blaow
You cut me out? I'll cut you out when I get praise for my style
And I won't be up out here wasting my time
One day I'll be getting green and then I'll spend it with slimes
I got loose screws? Yes, but that ain't new news
Guess is what I'm dressed in, suggestively caressing your best chick
I'm African and so fly so I should be arrested
You can't successfully second guess none of my messages
I separate myself from the rest of them
Besides Cordae, the new school? I'm the best of them
But I pray that God is blessing them
That nobody crashes like Tyler's Tesla, damn
No hooks on this hot beat
RIP DJ Screw, we stay chopped, not sloppy
Someone else is what I will not be
Last thing we need in this world's another copy
Where I live it just be rotten like Robbie
More murder than Fortnite lobbies where I be

[Outro]
Said where I be
Stay chopped, not sloppy
