Mic check 1, 2
Cause I'mma take 'em back on this one

[Verse 1]
Mama tell me that this life was on
So I let the door lock when I press record
The things I've seen they be going on TV screens
And through the eyes of a knucklehead who's 13
Looking back to my old ways, late for school
My moms yelled wake up like Dap from School Daze
Popping out of bed with a fucking levy head
But I never forgot my headphones or cassette tapes
Peace, no care in the world
I played Street Fighter instead of these little girls
And I never got love for the fact I was bad
But I made straight As from the back of the class
All my homework penning down lines
2Pac who? My idol was Busta Rhymes
But I've come to realise that the times have changed
But we still like to trip down on memory lane
Our reminiscing will remain the same
But instead this the song I sing

[Hook]
Baby how many times have I told you
You can't hang on to the past

[Verse 2]
Time flies like a condor
But we don't recognise from the back of that contour
From the [?] of video tapes
All the memories we've lost and dreams we take it's like
I remember wonders of the Sega
Ninja turtle movies and acting like power rangers
And I remember '97 on the south side
At the corner store flipping cheetos and hot fries
That was a long time ago
But I'd like to know that it was all worth it in the long run
But when we get old memories fade
But we still like to trip down on memory lane
Our reminiscing will remain the same
But instead this the song I sing

[Hook]
Baby how many times have I told you
You can't hang on to the past
