[Verse I]
Yo, let me have your concentration, weather you on the toilet constipated
Or you've to pull your dick out of a chick because your condom's breaking
If you have to get incarcerated, listen to me rhyme while driving intoxicated while the cops are chasing
Obligate the population abide the compilation
To cop a watch and braze it with diamonds the size of raisins
Let me have your cooperation 'cause if this song is playing on the radio, stop the waiting you gotta save it
I'm the hottest topic of conversation
I want the confirmation and got the church congregation to follow Satan
Confrontation with this rhyming abomination
To be a doctors patient with a combination the operation complications under medical observation
To find that the sick shit Mali spitting is not contagious
'Cause I'm better than all y'all, and we can rap in the court of law to see her deserves the source of all
Stop and face that I deserve a nomination election and inauguration into the presidential occupation
'Cause I'd be president if rap was the government, my verse is so hot you'll needing oven mitts to touch the shit

[Verse II]
You can catch Mal dressed in all red but I don't run with the clique
But you still get punched in the liver weather you blood or you crip
I rap solo if you don't include the gun on my hip and a couple of clips that'll make you tumble in fifth
It's like when Mal's rhyming niggas got nothing to spit
'Cause my verse is scarier than finding bumps on your dick
I got chicks rubbing they clits while they sucking my dick
And I'm humping their tits, in the back of a hummer with [?]
Got bundles of chips but I do it for the love of this shit
'Cause half of my money goes to taxes the government gets
You have been caught on like niggas with no thumbs on they fists
That a nigga as nice as Mal just doesn't exist
Ya'll only got some of rhymes I'm only feeling some of your shit
The sun is a hit you problem got from some of your bit
But it's alright ya'll can bite because ya'll supposed to be biters
'Cause my squad is grrrrrreat like Tony the Tiger
Imma tell the truth since you want me to rhyme
Tell you something on my mind that make me want to rewind
I was the one, shooting in the club with the nine
But blamed it on Puffy and Shine and said, "The gun wasn't mine"
Ya'll want me to stop, ya'll even hope that I fail
'Cause ya'll don't want me to drop like I was sober in jail
'Cause before I was discovered ya'll were spitting with courage
What's the matter? I'm too nice? Ya'll getting discouraged?
Scared like you crossing the border with two bricks in your luggage
Have nightmares about Mal, pissing your covers, I'm sicker than others
I'm sick like infectious diseases, lyrical miracles like I'm the resurrection of Jesus
