[Verse]

I was born blasphemy, catastrophy shall be cast on the
God, cuz Torn got no time to waste on him
Somebody once told me "You should not curse the god"
I said "Fuck you nigga I'm SUPERHOT"
Torné be the name you remember forever
I feel better than ever, fuck "never say never"
And I'll never be gay, but I respect some of them
But some of them should shut up before somenone buries them
I like the pussy but i love the rap
And I'm in love with the cash, I'll put it before an ass
Get a gat, shoot somebody to be funny
Then rob his body and dig his pockets for the money
I'm not an artist, I'm a tryhard dummie
I'm not a good rapper but my rhyme style demolish
Pops always told me to not solve shit with a fight
But here I am, dissin the God cuz my brother died
And I think it's right, tonight's the night
I dont care what anybody says cuz my niggas is tight
And I'm ready to write, wreck any mic
Destroy any motherfucker with a violent freestyle
And then come home, to be the lone Torn you all know
Long gone, that's how I wanna be pronto
I'm a product of the society, a fucking sickfit
A smart but retarded nigga with a wicked system
Nothings uplifting, everythings gonna be gloom
Thoughts are a curse since the womb, cuz from the womb im doomed
Yeah, truth be told, this is a twisted call
Who wanna join me in this twisted walk

[Outro]

Word is bond, you know what I'm saying? Torné on the Madlib track, Madvillain, MF DOOM, yeah
