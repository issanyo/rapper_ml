This one is for you.

[Early Years]
Back in the days when I was a teenager
Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find me rocking The College Dropout
Arguing with peers on the Middle Eastern Conflict
Winning state in debate was my number 1 accomplishment

[Collegiate Years]
College was a problem since my mind was always racing
Plus it's hard to pay attention when you have rent payments
Treated business like a practice not a page in a book
Started renting fancy dorms to kids with suburban outlooks
Left class for a job since my potential was stifled
Felt the type of ambition where Steve was my only rival

[Professional Years]
Nine to five is how you survive, I ain't trying to survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
HOV was the essence of my hustler mentality
Start selling software for twice the price they were paying me
Never did it for the money, but the comfort was nice
I just knew without the passion I'd be bored with my life
So I took it to the roots made an app with my friends
Fader hooking up the booth , rappers dig it and spit
We even brought rap lyrics to the classes and kids
Almost 50,000 users with no pennies to give
The lesson that I learned is to mix art with the biz

[Future Years]
Everything is full circle like the moon and the sun
So when I saw the job post I knew I already won
Not because I might get it, nothing is guaranteed
But because Rap Genius was made for people like me
In a world where sharing knowledge is the highest degree
And I know you dropped the rap , that's amazing to see
I think that genius.com/ feature is crazy my g
Even if the bars are corny, hope you clearly can see
Communication and creation are the powers in me
So when relating to the artists I will over achieve
And when talking to the labels I will always succeed
