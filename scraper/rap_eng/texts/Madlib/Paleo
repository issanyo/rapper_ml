It feels strange don't it?
A dope beat with soul and some 808s on it
A real rapper that's rapping no playing games on it
Or singers that can't sing trying to sang on it
They don't make 'em like this no mo' it got stank on it
Turn it up in your speakers wrinkle your face on it
Got me writing again I'm ending my break on it
So come and get this work, try not to strain on it
I was doing some soul searching, trying remember my love for the art
It's hard when that kind of music's rarely climbing up on the charts
An organic sound and an artist that's writing from the heart
Not just personal like a journal but nicer with the bars
But....... I'm done complaining I've come to change things
It's nothing mainstream, because common sense isn't common
If cats believe in total depravity as a doctrine
Then it's obviously an anomaly if we get top spins
The herds prefer them nursery kind of rhymes
I don't like the vibe, turned off my radio back in '95
Except The Wake Up Show
Strict diet like paleo
Party pooper
Feeling like the vegan at the barbeque or
Them 4 Hebrews at the king's table
Only vegetables and water steward the body and mind for God's use remain available
Obey Him who is able to make his crew unflamable
We know that the furnace applies to Hades too
The All Consuming Fire, the True Messiah
Inside the furnace with Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah
Choosing who's ignited and lights up
I'm reminded of Moses when he spoke to a bush that wasn't affected either
The irony of the One who's described as fiery
In the midst of a fire keeping his peeps in it fire free
Can I emcee with that kind of meekness, I find in Jesus
That can fry a beat and makes lies deceased but inspire peace?
I'd like to see it, if I can reach it then Christ achieved it
Not for me to say I'm a beast with the flyest pieces
I'm deceived if I believe this, I received gifts
