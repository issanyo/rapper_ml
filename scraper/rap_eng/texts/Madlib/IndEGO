[Verse 1: NOM]

Gather round for the lyrical genocide
I'd rather be criticized then fall and be victimized
All of the little guys they epitomize, systematized
If you can't feel it, then you see it through the system's eyes
Want to live like the beginning of days
As i reconsider criminal ways, I know it pays
But it hard walking miles for some minimum wage
Knowing damn well you belong center of stage
You got the spirit, well I got body I've been a soul
See the bigger picture like a centerfold
Literal original
First draft I've been dope
See by all the feelings that I envoke each and every pen stroke
Negatives in remission, cause closed eyes get the best vision
And more talk gets you less listens
Making drinks out of life's lemons
So I could spill them on dark denims and light linens
Now i'm the new jack, swinging like Mike Bivins
Just from flipping words, like a trunk full of white women
This frigid world will put your heart on a gurney
So I kneel to thank the lord on my journey
The dirty gutter that we revel in mixed with the word of the reverend
Got you motherfuckers so satisfied with settling
And the city is a barrel full of crabs
They hate to see me barrel down the ave
Trying to dim the inner pharaoh and the gab
The hero-in the pad
Got'em mad, got bars like a carrol and a half
You do the math
I have my whole eras zonin', here to raise the level of your serotonin
And they knowing, they can't fuck with it
Way too celibate
I'm in it to win it for the AU element, hella bent
Flowing with the midas caress
Lye to the chest, always leave me with the slightest of stress
Yeah
I paint a vivid picture just aim your frame
You move fast when you change your lane
I said I paint a vivid picture just aim your frame
You move fast when you change your lane
