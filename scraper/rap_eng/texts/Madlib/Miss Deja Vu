[Hook: Wildchild & Madlib]
Miss Deja Vu, she's at it again
Once again she's at it again (hey yo)
Little Miss Deja Vu, she's at it again
Once again she's at it again
(x2)

[Verse 1: Wildchild]
Yo its the Mr. Wildchild on the set
I rock the west end
My presence or my essence bringing girls to true confessions
'93, '94 stunts can be real tricky
Out for the green so I turn into a Bill Bixby
Fix me a drink so I can think
Now as I blink just one time
Peep out the girl that's walking, talking, awaken the sunshine
Crunch time
On to this girl named Mathilda
Didn't know this hottie killed a body builder
But will the girl in the tight (?)
Be different from the rumpled skins I met in the past year
Last year, moody but now I can think
The situations whack so Imma chill so Madlib can speak

[Verse 2: Madlib]
About Miss Deja Vu, you're at it again
You're scooping for the loot
You can hit the door and troop to to boot
And bust to regroup
Reroot, so bust the rendition
Emcees on the mission of wishing their rendition feels like I'm fishing
I play the role, got the soul through your console
I got the fat status
Ask Gladys Knight how I wore my habits
Slight promo with (?)
Gold diggin', (?) got squashed like a Rollo
Polo cologne got (?) to my collar
But when it comes down to the money it makes me holler
Hold up
Skins be trick nowadays, it make me bug out
And skins equals ends so I'd rather cool out with my friend

[Hook: Wildchild & Madlib]
Miss Deja Vu, she's at it again
Once again she's at it again (hey yo)
Little Miss Deja Vu, she's at it again
Once again she's at it again
(x2)

[Verse 3: Madlib]
Ay yo skins want to know the play
Can't live with them, can't live without them
So I buy them
I scrolls skins from the west
Double test when you're ex to the next
Plus I flex when I wrecks up your text
Skins be flippin'
Miss Deja Vu down for dippin'
I got it down to a T like Lipton
Hats for the Jims when I'm above the rim
Not loving them, but no baby in the oven
'Til I'm twenty-seven
But other than commitment
I'm thinking about the last hit
Or how my rap went
With this dame around the corner
When I gas into the Hooter's 'cause i'm all out for the bitches
From the Lisas
Stacy, Tracy, and the Suzette
Karen and the Bridgettes

[Verse 4: Wildchild]
Yeah how 'bout one day in August
Let's all gets together and bust our progress
Unless the fog gets too deep in detail
For you to rerail
Never see me fail
When it comes to freaking a female
Yo you're thick as plasma
Laid back charisma
Know my man Kan Kick has a
Extraordinary case of asthma
Commence to say hello
Knowing that my chest will
Expand, rather exhale
Brothers saying "you best chill"
Messing with those extraterrestrials
Skins that only come around the way unless we will
Clock, rock your joint, upstock the points we're making
Taking is your mission
Like special ed, you're not so hot when I be breaking
Your ill plans of trying to get over
But yo I still stands, taller
And its ironic, your pockets smaller
Call her Miss Deja Vu
Today you're through upsetting the ones that paid your dues

[Hook: Wildchild & Madlib]
Miss Deja Vu, she's at it again
Once again she's at it again (hey yo)
Little Miss Deja Vu, she's at it again
Once again she's at it again
