Check this shit out...
I got an eye, for you so why
Do I socialize bout (run it back, run it back)
I got an eye, for you so why
Do I socialize, don't ask me why
I look in your eyes, and fantasize
Bout you and I, then I wish I
Now I'm the fly shit that you like (run it back)
I'm the FLY shit that you like
And I despise you and didn't surprise me
We be fly you told me lies
And all this time, you was the sly shit
I despise, why you be shy?
Can't look me in the eye, I wonder why
You do the things to me

[Hook: All]
Things you do to me (run it back)
Things you do to me
Things you do to me (run it back)
Things you do to me

I knew this girl by the name of Hotpants
I miss her pants, babe you know you accelerate
You made me wait, for a goddamn day
I mean the nerve of this chick, giving ass so late
But you straight, you straight maybe you shouldn't be so hard
I mean oh my God (run it back) OH MY GOD!
I mean 1-1-1 its not a murder-uh
And even if I was I wouldn't murder-ya
Come here girl and give me all your uh
Give me all your uh, Things you do to me

[Hook: All]
Things you do to me

Whats the probl-im Ach-im? You better come clean
Get you whacked cause you wack
Its like a Kodak (Run it back)
Whats the probl-im Ach-im? You better come clean
Get you whacked cause you wack
Its like a Kodak, what I mean, your photograph
My mind, had me runnin' for telegraph
For You, Ooh, for our conversation we will fuck
On the roof at a tantra, say mama hold it back
The stimulator, tantrum master
Visualize the lotus, ladies and women the khakis is in my lingum
Notice the tactic, your mine (run it back) your mine
Things you do to me, uh Ohh

[Hook: All]
Things you do to me
Things you do to me
Things you do to me
Things you do to me
