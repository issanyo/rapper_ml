You gotta play the game, if you want to get the prize
From the first second a woman wants the same thing as you
But tell her so, she'll deny that it's true
You gotta play the game if you want to get the prize

[Quasimoto]
You gots to play the phony game
If you want to get the prize
1998, it's no surprise
It's 88 [?] to analyze
[?] drop the dollars
To the ladies if you're
Driving a Mercedes
Over lex
Finna try to put an X on
Put it down for a nigga with cash
And get that ass
But a nigga that's poor
To better he be gettin a horse
If you want to remain
You gots to play the phony game
It's a brain thing
The girls been doing the same thing
It's a Lord Quas reign
[?] dance or fuck the [?]
It's time for the Astro Black train
So where my main thing?
Find that your girl's talking behind your back
Some niggas give a smack
But yo I just act
Like everything's alright
Cause I'm a [?]
Just play the phony game
And go to tend to rollin lanes
I be acting like I'm gonna give these honies some money
But Lord Quas only play these dames like Jim Rummy
