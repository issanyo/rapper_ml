Yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Pat Battle in the house with the flow locked
Yes yes y'all, and we don't pause
I hear these new cats rappin', they so soft
Yes yes y'all, and I won't quit
Rebel rhythms on the heart and it's so sick
Yes yes y'all
Yes yes y'all
Yes yes y'all...

I'm callin' for the fall down all them autumn avenues
You can't escape my lauded brew, it will capture you
Drag you through the gravel, 'til you're down to just enamel
Then ignite you with a Camel, with verbal infinite ammo
My cammo is a color you brothers have never heard of
I'm guessin' it's trans-descent, commands to the damn freshman
Clear the arena when this lean fucking senior
Brings a mean team of dreamers on the scene
Lungs greener that iguanas, much a metronome like a piranha
Bomb monotonous metaphors into smithereens beyond the -
Scope that you could never hope to ever have to cope with
I leaked into your ozone from Oz through osmosis
No matter what your coast is, there ain't no need for postage
I up it and you download, that's how fuckin' sound rolls
Socially people share it, compare it to mainstream
That's some perilous merit, but money don't mean a damn thing
I ain't hustlin' shit - I'm more a philanthropist
Feel free to put up your fist if you know what this anthem is
If my skills are worth a bill, then I'd rather give it away
You're welcome, and other than that, what more can I say?
Cause fuck it - For some life is real as Emmett Till
Your lynchin' was encrypted into amendments and bills
Yet still, these liberals tell me life is all a thrill
But that don't amount to nil if I get killed for some Skittles
And Ice-T, SVU, Trayvon bled for you
If I go out being Black, I'll take one in the chest or two
That last line was written for you future special victims
These crooked cops is lookin' but you gotta move and stick 'em
In the jaw when they try to haul you off to plantations
I mean penitentiaries - Apologies, I'm mixin' centuries
Slavery is over - your shoulder
But you only been exposed to that road taken by Hova, but hold up
Sho' nuff - Every piece of dough can't be a doughnut
The vast majority of this minority is sorta free
But forty-three percent are in a shape that's really bent
And you ignore that note of sense at your very own expense
Cause nothing lasts forever, could be a random November
When the trotted on run their masters down and out of town
Listen clown, don't get it twisted - I'll get into specifics
Melanin's on a comeback - We closing out with one act
And I bet a fat stack some time travelers will run back
Make contact and say, "Keep spinning what you done spun, Pat"
So bump that - Incredible rhetoric leveled off with a hot beat
Not even the Devil would mettle with me
Allow the dust to settle, see?
