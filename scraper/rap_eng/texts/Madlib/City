[Verse 1: Karriem Riggins]
In and out city limits, there's many men and women
Broke, when they get dough they never try to spend it
Why? 'cause you know they say we living in a recession
Never listen to the government, you know they on a mission
And I'm here to tell you, I be in my zone, listenin'
When you travel abroad, then you can see the difference in
Economies overseas and Italy
Every other whip is Maserati QP
I never learned the ins and outs while livin' in the D
Or how to pay the taxes on the income I receive
Yeah, I guess that's how the politics be
We gon' have to pave the way for y'all [?]
With Exxon stop price bubblin'
The gas price on my [?] is doublin'
Higher than the giraffe's ass, they 'bout to stick it to ya
They got a shovel, 'bout to dig in your stash

[Hook: Karrium Riggins]
That's why we on tour and (In the city)
We live, we on tour and in your (City)
That's why we on tour and (In the city)
We live, we on tour and in your

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, moving in my Cutlass through the city limits
Roof leaking in the bucket, yeah we was penny pinchin'
Empty stomach, have you looking forward to Thanksgiving
Cold Spam, fried balogna, yeah I forgot to mention
That's what I was raised on, jumped off in the game on
I was thinking lobster like a mobster, getting my sting on
Bald caps, [?] erection, get you banged on
Living like Tony Soprano, I'll make the district change the gang laws
Gang bang, gang land, dope exchange hands
Back in '01, I hit a gangsta lick for eighty grand
Comparing me to these rappers, you must be playin'
I'm a fucking naked fire, you just a flash in the pan, God damn
And if I wasn't rapping, I'd be still flossin'
Jumped up off that phony label, now I'm straight bossin'
I'm selling keys to dope fiends, sleep walkin'
Push a cold nine, dead once you crossin' in my city

[Hook: Karrium Riggins]
Yeah, we live, we on tour and in your (City)
That's why we on tour and (In the city)
We live, we on tour and in your (City)
(City)
(In the city)
(In the city)
