[Talib Kweli]
I don't like to curse
Most time the spirit guide my hand and write the verse
I swear to God it's so odd, I get a lot of hatred
But I know I'm God's favorite, so my job is sacred
The rep that I catch in the both is my retribution
Kick your illusion then I break'em like a resolution
I swear to God that I'll smoke less, I don't smoke cigerettes
I swear to God I'll try to say "nigga" less
I swear to God I'll slow up, I swear to God I'll blow up
I mix that vodka and that yak, I swear to God I'll throw up
I swear to God I'll tow up, I swear to God I'll quit
Next day, I swear to God, I'm fine, nigga, pass the fifth
Sorry I got to swear, but I know God is here
I'm never scared, it's the fear of God that got us here
And so we're here to stay it certainly appears that way
Everyday I swear to God that what I heard Him say
