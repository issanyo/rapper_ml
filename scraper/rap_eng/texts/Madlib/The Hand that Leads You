[Verse 1]
Why I came: to fire flames, Lyrics require brains
Y'all admire lames and liars that need to retire, mane
Perce is phat, when I burst your raps
Underground and commercial cats
Know where my turf is at: BX!
[???????] must not be knowin' I'm blowin' minds
Got me holdin' concealed weapons, fuckin' live
Brothers bust, leave mothers crushed and lovers blushed
Try to smother us, while others just shuck and jive
Get cash to spit without askin'
Chicks be passionately flashin' tits [??????????]
Every ho in the place be knowin' the face
Blow at an uncontrollable place
When the show put my dough in the case
Vicinity trifeless, make thugs with identity crisis
Enter de ciphers and many men'll be lifeless
Nothin' you roast ill, better hope real cats don't recognize
You're no-frills, talkin' money and dope deals and broke still

[Verse 2]
Like a thug in the street, muggers discreetly huggin' the freaks
Be lovin' the meat, the lyrical cat with the ruggeder beats
Tracks are raw, still cats ignore the fact I'm more
Better than the ones you askin' for on racks in stores
Give fat checks, this rap vet's verbal gats let off
Rounds then clap sets, leavin' tracks wet
MCs are rote, he's the most famous Eastern coast
Spittin' like I'm squeezin' toast and don't leave the post
This here's proper, don't dare knock my hustle, man
If you just a damn sharecropper and near copper
The best of stars can't mess with bars like the rest of y'all
They get left in tar like woolly mammoth brains in [??????]
Rhymes are dope, better cop now, my hip hop sound
Could get me locked down like I got found with lines of coke
Don't spend hours to send power-ful lines to bring the place down and have your men shower the skies like twin towers
