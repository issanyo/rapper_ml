You're so basic your ass is the opposite of acid
I'm dropping science and you blind eye it, why am I trying?
Why am I lying? its effortless, I'm destined to be excellent
I'm reckoning I'm the one that they'll recommend
So relish in being next to my essence because my presence is a blessing
You were presented with a present when I opposite of exited
So don't forget the shit cuz I'm the excrement
I don't know if they'll catch that shit
That's the complex, next level, elevating, bass to treble
Einstein, no recline, refine your mind rhyme
Universal, started off with a big bang
And now ruling everything using space and time
You can call it flow or you can call it physics
Going forever, nothing can stop me can't even feel any friction
Coming full circle, lyrics are alchemic
Started with twenty-six letters now look, the end result is infinite
