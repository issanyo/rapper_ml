[Verse: MF DOOM]
Villain get the money like curls
They just tryin' to get a nut like squirrels in his mad world
Land of milk and honey with the swirls
Where reckless naked girls get necklaces of pearls
Compliments of the town jeweler
Left back now-schooler tryin' to sound cooler
On the microphone known as the crown ruler
Never lied to ma when we said we found the moolah
Five-hundred somethin' dollars layin' right there in the street
Huh, let's now let's try and get somethin' to eat
Then he turned four and started flowin' to the poor
That's about when he first started going raw
Kept the 'dro in the drawer
A rhymin' klepto who couldn't go up in the store no more
His life is like a folklore legend
Why you so stiff, you need to smoke more, bredren
Instead of trying to riff with the broke war veteran
Spliff made him swore he saw heaven he was seven
Yup, you know it, growin' up too fast
Showin' up to class with Moet in a flask
He ask the teacher if he leave will he pass
His girl is home alone he tryin' to get the
If you want a sip get a paper water fountain glass
How I'm 'posed to know where your mouth been last
Hands so fast he can out-spin the Flash
Known to smoke a whole mountain of hash to the ash
Boom-bash leave the room with the stash
Assume it's in a smash, DOOM get the cash
