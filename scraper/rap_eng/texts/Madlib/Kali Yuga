Darling, you send me
Darling, you send me

Honest you do, honest you do, honest you do
You thrill me
Darling you thrill me
Baby, you, you thrill me
Honest you do, honest you do, honest you do
At first, thought it was infatuation
Ooh, it lasted so long, so long
Now I find myself wanting
I want you to marry me, please take you home
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You, you send me

Honest you do, honest you did
You know you did
You know, you do now
You send me

Honest you

You're moovy, you're groovy
You send me
I just, I just, I just dare you to send me
Guess I'm a sinner
Make me a longer
I, I, I, I, I, I just can't stand it
Thrill me, kill me
Send me, send me, baby
Pretty baby
