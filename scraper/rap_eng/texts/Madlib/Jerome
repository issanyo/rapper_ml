Trying to Grim Reaper this evil way that I've been thinking
Tidal-wavic spitting has got my relationship sinking
Having nightmares of my chick leaving & dick shrinking
Stick for weeks cause that pen's leaking of pigment ink
Twin Lincolns are notwithstanding cause your opinion stinks
Spit, either way, hot as grabbers of Suave deodorant
Them chicks winking, now they blinking like eyelids closing
With semi-automated rapid-ass vagina openings
It's over with, see the graveyard's all you're going in
Rival Oakland so I stay charged, highest voltages
Chronic-blowing when the way I motion's like I'm Soulja Slim
Competition frozen when he came to stop the show again
Reaching for the stars with broken collarbone & limb
You're smoking more than pot assuming local cops controlling him
