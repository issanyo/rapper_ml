[Verse 1: Madlib]
Down at electric avenue
Stabbin' you, revvin' you for the fat revenue
Steppin' to you or whoever wants to break through
I got the AM/FM blues
Most niggas ain't paid dues
But if you snooze and you lose
Then choose the real flavor
Played off with the crews
I got the dice for the wager
So I'm checking my pager
Whether minor to a major, doesn't matter
I'll spray you with mad rhythms

[Chorus]
If you're not down to bust the physical
We'll make all you suckas go spiritual... (Warning...)
(The surgeon general... Has determined...)
(Devastating... To your ear...)
If you're not down to bust the physical
We'll make all you suckas go spiritual
State enters mental
If you're not down to bust the physical
We'll make all you suckas go spiritual
Wildchild, hit 'em with the ill lyrical

[Verse 2: Wildchild]
Roll with the soul man
Slow floats negator
Motivator of the greater emcees with the hardcore data
From the inner soul, Wildchild will end your flow
Most don't even know
I'm like the Mickey Brown, kick, evenflow
Even though, Madlib, dude the Bad Kid, crack ribs
Lootpack's definition of abstract is
Take the vibe in your one hand, motivation in the other
Dedicate, never hesitate, to flow like no other
'95 bust my rhythmatic flows the ill type
Nowadays why is a two-faced brother still write
Wack ish

(Warning...)

Props to the Evangelistic Baptist
Church from Oxnard it's the first
Time I represent, and I'm not hesitant
Step to give props to my 805 residence
