(Chorus)

(Verse 1)

I remember chill days on the sofa
Filled with warm kisses taste like Orange Crush Sodas
She feel in love cuz' the dude is no poser
Not for the glamour or the faces on the posters
Always supportive in the crowds at the shows
Feels great cuz' the kid got money now
Skip the cash thinkin' time we could spend
It's no joking, but it seem that it's funny how
The world spins with its slow poke axis
Piff got his women straight backspint'
If you tripping then i'll pitch you like a lateral
Hard to understand women like accents
But it's cool I keep her locked like an inmate
Asked her how it feel to be romancing with a great
She said "One of a kind and I'm happy that ya mines."
Always amazed the way she always hold me down like right
Soaring through the stars between the bright lights
Hold ya eyes tight, cuz snatching niggas sights with her beauty

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)

Here's when the tables turned on me
Said it turns out she had a feel for my homie
They kept the thing lowkey
Said he even told me that he stuck it in the cloche, so I said okie-dokie
But really in the inner
I knew it was the end of something quite beautiful, with feelings quite mutual
Just goes to show if you love it the end of you
She grabbed a sword useable, and stuck it through my cuticle
But it's cool I got the rep of a player
I'm tryna pitch my game to a girl who can play....,
By the rules til' the point I stay lovin' her
Later get the jewels like rock thiefs and smugglers
I killed the lover's bug....
