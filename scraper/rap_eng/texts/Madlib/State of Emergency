[Intro]
This is a state of emergency (x3)
Hold it Now, Hold it Now, Hold it Now, Hit It!!

[Verse 1 - Almighty U-Sorcerer]
My mind controls others, never been emancipation
I schooled so many niggas, now I’m out here graduating
Taxman coming, better have your notice filed
Why you talking posing for the bogus, you the poster child!
Worldwide dominance, G15 in conglomerate
If you have a hypothesis, you best keep it anonymous
Cause in the world of mayhem, your opinion is irrelevant
Me and the Master are your new representatives

[Verse 2 - Gamemast15r]
I’m the nightmare that haunts the dreams of Freddy Kruger
Fuck Peggy Sue, I’m the one that’ll bring Jason’s machete to ya
It’s the state of emergency, World War plus Armageddon
I got the sudden urge to purge now that my palm’s are sweatin'
Ain’t no way in hell I’ll pay for my sadomasochist sins
The only pussy Michael Myers gets are the cats that he’s skinned
I’ll throw a Molotov on the ground just to light myself on fire
Just to burn the skin of a snitch to see if he’s wearing a wire

[Verse 3 - Almighty U-Sorcerer]
Unfortunate, put the industry in coordinate
Hang a nigga by his nuts, he a living ornament
Squad of scorpions, aiming missiles killing all the corporate
And any forms of enforcements are fucked, they in an orphanage
Grew up a mercenary, yeah, that’s killer elite
In the new world, we give no fucks about religious belief
Leaving ignorant niggas scared, call a therapist
In the new world, anyone who doubts is a terrorist

[Verse 4 - Gamemast15r]
Me & the Sorcerer, conjuring up deadly poisons in the secret labs
Leave the raps to us, the magic stuff, your wife’s a piece of ass
I lure the weak, in actuality I could actually murder peace
And disappear, cause I’m the motherfucker that you heard the least
The government’s afraid, they just activated Defcon 1
Ready to be a Martyr, that’s why I got no teflon son
If you wanna spill some blood, then lemme hear some soo-woo
I don’t pray to false idols, that’s why I worship Cthulu

[Verse 5 - Almighty U-Sorcerer]
50 shades look a shade deeper with the gatekeepers
The late sleeper suddenly becomes a great leader
Grade teachers used to look down on my ways to criminate
Brain teasers, a daydreamer was gon' equilibrate
Minds I manipulate are left with but a silhouette
Anytime you disobey the order, you disconnect
Me and the Master connect like magnetic forces
Feeling a little sick from handling infected corpses

[Verse 6 - Gamemast15r]
It’s the state of emergency, ring the alarm bell
I got enough rolling thunders to firebomb hell
I’m the incarnate of hatred, does it make sense
I take cases out the slugs and give you a fucking face-lift
I gave acupuncture to the leader of the Cenobites
I like the thrill of the hunt, leave you seven days and seven nights
I’m the lighter fluid, ain’t no way to douse the fuel
Crucifying Jesus is child’s play compared to what I’m bout to do

[Verse 7 - Almighty U-Sorcerer]
You gave them acupuncture when I looked at the centerpieces
And when they was sleeping on me, I gave them Tempur-Pedics
And when the Master giving facelifts, the Sorcerer’s in the snake pit
Do I have to translate it? Or are you humans still creative?
They double up and we don’t duplicate
Make niggas hallucinate, never do rejuvenate
Every time another human tries to communicate
I assassinate, watch Illuminati illuminate and fumigate

[Verse 8 - Gamemast15r]
I come from underground tunnels where I dwell with the lizard people
Even to the illuminati I’m the one that’s considered evil
I’ll beat Ray Charles with a baseball
Ain’t no way to see it coming, I’m rock hard, you stay soft
I was there when they planned 9/11
I was there when Lucifer fell and died from heaven
I whip out banana clips to split your dome like an apple
Enough lead to crush your brain to liquid like a Snapple

[Outro]
Load the Uzis up for the loony fucks (x3)
This is a state of emergency
