Verse 1:

I'm the definition of ill will
It's time for you to real recognize real
The rhymes that I write, kill
My lines pure like coke, it have you standin' still
After that I ask you, "how you motherfuckin'
Feel?"
Stay talkin' sayin this rappin shit a phase
Don't fuck with me, cause then you'll realize
This ain't no fuckin game
Sneak dissin man, that's a damn shame
I ain't got no time for that, I'm tryna rise
To fuckin fame, uh
Keep spittin' this lyrical
Criminal, mathematical
Problems that keep happening in this world
These bitches be egotistical
Cynical, problematical
Don't even know what the fuck is going on
Luh, I'm just tryna muhfuckin' get high
You should already know that the fuckin' end is nigh
Aye, lil bitch. Aye, we finna put you in a ditch


Verse 2 (Clarity):

Bring the old school back
This that old school rap
Lyrics hard like a baseball bat until your brain goes flat
I ain't gon' take no naps, I gotta take my chance
I'm like the master, this dream I'm chasing after
I had a couple friends but them niggas is always bad blood
They never held me down, they be walking out of bounds, so I'm calling out the foul
I be civil in a crowd, I'm a symbol to your town, I be chilling in the lounge
Smoking green from the ground, started from the ground up
Now they see me now, I need get the cash and I ain't tryna be greedy now. We need to help the fam til we rolling through the city, wow
They said I'm number 9 bitch, I'm number 1
Numbers don't lie cause I'm the chosen one
Cause I'm the chosen one (x3)


Verse 3:


Now we be rollin' thru yo set, hood
Don't give a muthafuck
You already know we be deep in the fuckin'
Cut
Keep spittin' and thinkin' about what's on
My mind
You already know I'm tryna hit it from
Behind
Now, watch these lyrics intertwine
I'm tryna give you a feelin' that could go
Down your spine
Look, yeah this some real hip hip shit, watchu hip-hop kids really know bout this?
I keep grindin' wit the spray
I grip the spray (x2)
I grip that muhfuckin' spary
I gotta spray this shit. Like it's an uzi-clip, I put that blood on my hip
And watch that muhfuckin' blood drip, bitch
