And so what it said [12x]

[Verse 1: Declaime]
I hope this message stays in your head
What good as a man if he's dead or well-read
Keep yourself to yourself
The status of your wealth to yourself
Talk is not good for your health your well-being
Things that I'm seeing in this world today
Make me stand up to say
Wake up don't sleep just keep doing for thyself
Gain knowledge of self to live long
With a long health history
Forever you will be used in the views by the system
Take ear to these words that I say and just listen

And so what it said [12x]

[Verse 2: Declaime]
Why always misled?
Only you can shed light on life's questions
Declaime is never stressing
The fact that as long as I'm black
Nobody's gonna give me any kind of slack
So I take that fact and attack from all angles
My pure soul strangles
Those that been keep me down so I get down
Over fat instrumentals
Never trying to preach cause it's all simple
It's all in your head don't be misled

And so what it said [12x]
