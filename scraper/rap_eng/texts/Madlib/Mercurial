[Verse 1]
Yo I transmit wisdom to fans through handwritten grams
Then transition home as fast instant transmission
This edition of the story only deepens the plot
That's been 'E' on for weeks. The reason I've been sleeping a lot
It goes from freezing to hot despite what season passes
Because the smoke left from my mic releases greenhouse gasses
And this conceded rapping is to appease the masses
Sat on the toilet for too long now I'm paraplegic
Revoked my Yonko status. Those in charge have got me fucked up
My best friend left me now she's off on to her own stuff
So what? This happens and the result leaves your soul crushed
Correct if i'm wrong but this is called being a grown up
These sown shut eyes now wide open to the sight of all four walls put up around me so nobody gets inside
Style is so electrifying its considered death defying
If you cannot accept my mind expect a Pontius Pilate
I the obvious child is still tapping on his desk
Instead of listening to lectures by day dreaming about sex
Unless we're learning about something that contests
The current status of social order we follow til we're dead


[Verse 2}
Fixing a black hole where the rain gets in
Was once dry, now I'm drenched till my tool belt sings
Whistle while you work to make the repair much faster
To face me there's some steps that you first must master
The first being diction. Be sure to carry your poems
So you can hang like crucifixes in an Italian homes
Your battalion sums up to how much strength it takes
For me to lift the paper used for writing this ho-hum account
Well I might as well show them I've kept to myself for this time stowed away in my sarcophagus
I've built for the apocalypse to keep safe when the bombs get rid of everyone above me who has loved me or the opposite
If there's a proper way to live then please come and show me
The headrush of love had me feeling less lonely
The come down is heavy but I've steadily coped with that adverse effect. I'm more a less a monk
As hum-drum as some tumble weeds is life without the company
Introvert to extrovert. Transforming like I'm Bumblebee
Rumble packs attached to me to shake up the events
Within the game of life I'm playing where my last live's spent
