[Chorus: MED]
And even though they say the sun gone shine no more
We live on borrowed time, till I reach the sky
Feel the tear drop falling out of heaven’s eye
Even though it’s dead, I’ve never felt so alive

[Verse I: MED]
So I rhyme like, in the fall like
No alcohol, but still in a bar fight
My persona like bulls out in Barcelona
I take charge like a cell man ain't rolling over
Born leader, neva do what I’m suppose to
With more shit to the street than a foreclosure
I speak heat till the beat they repeat over
You sound better when the DJ’s talking over
Even though you win, the cycle spins
He kissed yesterday, and told 'em, “Till we meet again”
Never looking back (na), even though ain’t promised
For the dollars as long as the crown holla
Follow me

You know to appreciate a win
You gotta go through losses, you know, damn
You gotta keep ya head up though

[Chorus: MED]
And even though they say the sun gone shine no more
We live on borrowed time, till I reach the sky
Feel the tear drop falling out of heaven’s eye
Even though it’s dead, I’ve never felt so alive

[Verse II: Blu]
Red walls, head strong, chest on
Got flesh friend of yours, goddess
I obsess treat her like an object, sex
Timeless, got her stretch for a catch like
I get stress when I think about the rent
She undress quick, left me a hick on my neck, chest
New York are fly for the next two week
Two sheets end up mess up my music
Orchestrated music set, you amused me
You sweet celestial beast through beauty on the bed
Head thresh, yeah, better than the rest and best and blessed
And yes, if the question is a subtle hint of high heaven scent
I say, bliss
Eight kisses take infinite intentions to the fest
And the dimensions is where we met, bet


[Chorus: MED]
And even though they say the sun gone shine no more
We live on borrowed time, till I reach the sky
Feel the tear drop falling out of heaven’s eye
Even though it’s dead, I’ve never felt so alive

[Outro: Blu]
Yeah, M-E-D, uh, B-L-U, uh, yeah
