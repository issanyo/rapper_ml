B-Boy style, the B-Boy style [?]
B-Boy style, the B-Boy style
As we go next to them, made up all real texts up
Rumors Lootpack they possess mad fix up
Break down your inside and your vocab structure
I be the beat conductor, I be the rhyme constructer

[Wild Child]
I wanna break it down for them cats out there who don't know
About the cats known as the LP coming from the West coast
These cats got lyrical, metaphorical styles intact
They know how to represent their own issue
Coming and hit rap
Beyond ones creative abilities to commercialize
Mainstream artists survive, while Wildchild dies
Snap dab in the middle of the rap game bringing realness
Emcees wanna lease either my rhyme style 'cos I own this

[Madlib]
I be the instrumental inventor 'bent to the center
My walk is genetic I leave you cut with no anesthetic
Let your wave slaves in the industry think they got this
Triple darkness it's red when I spark this
We living in a less life, we put strife
Negative ideas, they got the positive ideas
But what about them in between ideas move they to the rear
When we rock the mic you better beware

As we go next to them, made up all the texts up
Rumors Lootpack they possess mad fix up
Break down your inside and your vocab structure
I be the beat conductor, I be the rhyme constructer

[Madlib]
Hey yo, first lets wonder why so many people wanna be emcees
They got that whack rhyme disease ya'll better off play beat
Over seas, I put your [?] on freeze
Task come billing and chilling, pilling and dealing with niggas like to the ceiling
I'm known as the slang buster
Hit ya with the world trade of loops chill with my troops
How you think the fake can do?
You strictly in it for them G-s
The hip hop that we drop just like fresh squeeze
While your flows are probably frozen and your beats are all stolen
We keep it in the base of rolling while your crews be bowlin

Block pop back spin, wind mill, flare, pose
Bust in ninety nine while this nigga kicks flows
The influence B-Boy music had on me was more than rap did
I adapted, got DJ Romes and plus Madlib combined
To influence those of rap man-kind
We shine a different type of life too strange line
You fake knuckle head do-do jacks, I call you back cuz what you do to rap
We'll diss you every time you kick styles that aren't your own

As we go next to them, made up all the texts up
Rumors Lootpack they possess mad fix up
Break down your inside and your vocab structure
I be the beat conductor, I be the rhyme constructer

As we go next to them, made up all the texts up
Rumors Lootpack they possess mad fix up
Break down your inside and your vocab structure
I be the beat conductor, I be the rhyme constructer

Beat boy style, beat boy style, we make a rhyme
Beat boy style
One two, one two
One two, one two, one two, one two
Like that, pop that sound
