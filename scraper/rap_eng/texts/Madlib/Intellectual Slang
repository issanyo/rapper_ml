[Verse 1]
I'm rollin' thick, with a crew of niggas
Never holdin' triggers, too busy counting these dime figures
Bigger than any nigga sicker and quicker
Middle finger for a gold digger
Plus my pockets getting thicker, uh
Catch me with Eternal Presence at a show
Quick scope the scene, homie creep real slow
I'm low-key when I'm tryna drive by on these niggas
Ride or die for my niggas, sky high on these niggas
Fuck the world 'til I'm gone, and yo it's still on
I'm tired of these people playing the same old songs
Dre P got convicted of first degree murder
Cause I'm killing on the beat in a way you never heard of
Spitting game to Sherane, little homie better learn
Dumb niggas poppin' rubbers that's why they gettin' burned
I'm concerned for these so-called tough guys claiming cliques
Acting like a bitch when it's time to empty clips
From the north to the south
The east to the west
Anybody that want it can get the stone to the chest, huh
You gotta love it cause I'm never duckin' or runnin'
I count my duckets, life's a bitch so we just fuck it and It's on

[Hook]
And it's on
And it's on (Nigga Nigga)
And we on
Yea, to my peoples on the block slanging them thangs
For all my niggas please bump that Intellectual Slang it's on (2x)

Check, check it, check it, check it

[Verse 2]
I said I'm like the cure for cancer spreading through the hood
If you don't like what you hear, let's get this understood
Hear it loud and clear, See I don't give a fuck
Kidnap the preacher, throw him in the back of the truck
Hear the bass pump, thump inside the trunk
Thugs stay quiet but they guns loud as fuck
These hoes getting dumped, niggas getting slumped
Seeing how it go
You dead wrong
I'm giving sentences to nouns and verbs
It's getting crazy that's why he stay puffin' on the herb
And I heard people sayin' that the south side lost it
Sick of wack songs being put out very often, I'm coughing
I'm 'bout a get H.O.C
If you ain't read the title homie, it's that G.O.E
You see I'm living my dreams, ya'll living them nightmares
Why they call me nigga cause I got the nappy hair
These waters are flowin'
Yo girl is hoein'
I'm already with the stars, when I smile the room glowing, huh
Rest in peace to the legendary soldiers
I still catch snakes talking shit over my shoulder, it's on

[Hook]

Where my peoples at, uh
Put ya'll hands up, put ya'll hands up
High in the sky, what, uh
Intellectual Slang
What 'chu know about that homeboy uh
