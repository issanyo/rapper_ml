Groovin'
I said groovin'
Dig it, groovin'
So groovin', groovin', groove
G-g-g-groove on
G-g-g-g-g-groovin'
And and and and
Whew
That's what I said
Slow mellow rhythms
You know
Groovin' and black
Slow, mellow
Dig it!

Rock the house and
Rock the house and
Rock the house and

Do what you want, do what you like
Do what you feel, do what you please
(Repeats)

Jazz yah
Jazz put you on a swing
In a project playground
Backward all the way
As someone giving you a push backwards
Were to start you on your journey up

[Outro: Leon Spencer]
Hi
This is Leon Spencer
One of the greatest organers in jazz and funk
We're tracing back the origins of hip-hop with Madlib
Who is also a Scorpio
Like Lou Donaldson and Leon Spencer
