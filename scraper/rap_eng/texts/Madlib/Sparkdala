[Hook]
Ayo, I sparkdala, you sparkdala
Everyday anyway yo, I sparkdala

(Ayo Madlib, explain to these people why you so dedicated to that tree you've been smoking)

[Verse 1]
Ayo, if you don't know I smokedala daily
I been smoking since I was sixteen (yo, really?)
Word to my moms, I strictly smoked bombs
I smoked with dykes, hardheads and Uncle Toms
Lawyers, beat-makers, junkies and flunkies
Niggas that look like monkeys, smoking on skunky
Sticky in the movies niggas, ask before you hit
Down in the basement, we always get bent
Create that ill shit that make you wanna smoke
Choke out the throat, always got it in my coat
Or in my pocket with a gold and steel target
If you my nigga then you know we gonna spark it

(Why?) Cause I smoke the la, everyday anyway yo, I sparkdala

[Hook]
Ayo, I sparkdala, you sparkdala
Everyday anyway yo, I sparkdala

[Verse 2]
I smokedala so much my breath smells like the bottom of a bong (ew)
I takes dirty long hits and let the shit smoke up
And get strong in my chest, I used to smoke the stress
Now I strictly smoke chronic so I can feel the sonic
Drinkin' 40's, that's my tonic (Pass that bubbler)
When niggas smoke my shit, they all be on it
By the time they done, they be like "yeah that's bionic"

[Hook]
Ayo, I sparkdala, you sparkdala
Everyday anyway yo, I sparkdala

[Outro]
My nigga Medaphoar hit that la
My nigga Declaime hit the la
My nigga Kazi
My nigga Kan Kick
Oh No the mischievious
My man (?)
My man (?) hit the la
My nigga Lollipop
My nigga Roxy hit the la
DJ Romes used to hit the la
Mr. Buddha hit the la
Lord (?) hit the la
(?) hit the la
