[ Verse ]
The Body Flicker , Nobody Sick'a
Not A Hick Or Magic Johnson Hitch-Hiking In The Wint'a
Ninja Nigga Rolling With Master Splinter
I'm Hailing From The Dirty Ville The Place Where Looks Will Kill Ya
My Margins Stay Harder Than Compton, I'm Not The One To Sin With
I Split Shit Like Spliff Mixed With Cigs And Some Piff
A Tragedy How I Gained The Audacity To Invade Ya City And Become A King Like Hail Your Majesty
Crazy How These Bastards Speak And Rap And Shit When All That Yap Is Ass Of Cheek
I Bury The Hatchet, You Would've Swore It Was Magic
A Hyena, You Just Be Lying Like Another Snoop 
Its Like Every New Rapper That Come Out Is Just Another Stoop
Another Step Behind Me Cause You Gum Niggas Some Bubble Chew
On That Brotha Bubba Dud' Power Bombs Through Tables
Undertaker When You Submit, Like Damn Nigga What's With Him?
Something In His System Even The Misfits Can't Fuck With Him
Flow Became To Cold And These basic Niggas Start Vanishing
But It's All Good Cause There All Pale In Comparison
I Find It Embarrassing How These Rappers Are So Obvious
Niggas Stay True Religion, I Kill Them The Way I Moccasin
I'm Mopping Them , Obnoxious, Draining All Their Oxygen
When There Arms Flail Man I Swear I'm On The Opposite Of Moderate
The Rapping Jumped To Horror Flick, To Flip To Change The Channel Quick
I Flipped The Script, Now You Dreaming Twisted Like Some Cannibus
Damn Who matching These Hands Of His?
Once I Was A Pacifist, Now I'm Quick To Pass A Fist
My Pack Packs Punches Like Snack Pack Lunches, You Whack Ass Hussies Get Trampled
I'm Not From This Earth How You Think I Manhandle These Mammals
Swerve A Verse And KABOOM!, Rapper Became Bambi
Ending Ya City I'd Take The Heat Of Miami
And Every Line I Wreck Home Just Like Hurricane Sandy
Crazy How I Sit Them Down When They Really Can't Stand Me
I'm Ali Milicec, Road To Gain A Mil-A-Check
Type To Keep Ya Ho In Check She Out And In On To The Next
It's Like You Scared Straight, Staring Til Your Hairs Gray
Cause Mr. Body Flicker Type of Nigga To Pull The Trigger
Passing Asses While You rappers Cadillac Up On The Whack Shit
Bashing You All Til' There's No Massesssssssssssssss !
