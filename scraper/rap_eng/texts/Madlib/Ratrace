[Verse 1]
Now the way you walked by had me running right after
And I never chase pussy but that's another chapter
Got me caught up in the rapture
Anita for real
Sweeter than the pill, candy-coated Advil
Take that pain, minus my migraine
Don't be like that, let me know your name
Put it through them lips thats as full as your frame
But she couldn't be tamed 'till her friend lay claim
Seem him on BET, ooh game
Now I'm in but I never like to win it like that
Sign a napkin for her friend, put the pen in the cap
Turned and walked away with the wind to my back
I blew her off
Threw her off
Respect me bitch like you're 'sposed to do a boss
Supervise her, I do despise her
Bandwagon bitch, quick to switch dick rider

[Hook]
'Cause I don't chase
I won't race
Just slow down let me set the pace
Heavy on the top with an itty bitty waist
With an ass, hips, lips, and a face like

[Verse 2]
Trying to find one that like me
'Cause I like most of them
Most of y'all get a kick out of playing with us men
Make us fight over
Waste the night over
Who should save face and be polite over
Other fish in the sea, more salmon upstream
I'm trying to find me one thats understanding of the dream
Jamming on the one but slamming on the team
By the team I mean
Me and you, you and I
I will clear the bench if you are that fly
But most just hover, so we wind up lovers
Homies, friends, won't know me 'till the end
But I do enjoy the time that we spend
Hang out for a while, maybe catch a flick
Then we do it doggy style and you fetch the dick
We do it from the back 'cause I can't front
You are one of many not the one that I want

[Hook]
