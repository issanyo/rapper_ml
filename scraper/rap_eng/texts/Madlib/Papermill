All day

Be celibate, out of his element
Madvillain never forget like a elephant
Any bent 'cept, idle threats all irrelevant
Get your man's wallet, tell him "found it", and sell him it
Well writ, as well as well spit for the hell of it
Before the shell hit
Etiquette, spell it
Pumpin dumplins a hundred and sumthin sumthin
Forest Gump chumps get clumps of nuttin' for nuttin'
Tourist, show 'em where the shore is where the shark's at
Hold up, spark that, park rat
Stirred not shaken
Absurd verbs since word to hot bacon
Wrote this rhyme on standard sand paper
Worked out the plan and plot for grand caper
Vil on the cover of Playbill
Grillin' make ya mother say "Ill, hey will ya!?"
Ten feet at least, the beast may still ya
Yeah I feel ya
Hey, hey what's better than the healer yet worser than tequila?
A money-gettin' nigga that's thirstier than a squealer
I guess you had to be there, there was free beer
Last of the Ansars
On the microphone, cyclone, like Myanmar
Hand in the jar, got stuck, took it
Use the glasses, juxed a pot luck, crooked
Flashed and not lookin'
Four words: Cash on the spot... bookin'
Howdy
Never too loud for me, too rowdy and too black and too proud to be
And he's Audi
Last seen with a Queen
Lakum Dinukum Waliyadin
Nah mean?
