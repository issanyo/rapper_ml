Jise One [verse 1]

Brainstorm crash the weather advisory
The mind freeze in the midst of a heatwave, the step sway blindly
But I could smell the decay, the "L" accumulate, but still on track smashing the relay race
Through all seasons, for all reasons
An acquired taste in treason break mirrors like promises
Ride in the coaster, keep ya feet in
I'm lo key, OG'd up...leaving the seat up!
Put it together, take it apart!
May as well signed a pre-nup
Love and hate are one in the same
With a grain of salt, pain will assault
Lt ya, so I dead it, look at the outline, that's fresh chalk
The eyes clear, but I'm edgy like the life of a turbulent storm, in exuberant form while the sky looks torn
Born royalty, adorned prophecy, enslaved in poverty, nail me to the cross and mock me, you can't stop Me!

That's good yo
Napoleon Da Legend: Good looking
Napoleon Da Legend [hook x2]

Don't mean to rain on your parade
Take a swig of this elixir sure to take away your pain
Wash it all down, ya lenses seem tainted
In a form of a dream woke up and then create it

Napoleon Da Legend [verse 2]

Yo Peeping the carcass’s that darkness left
Architect I parallel parked the car then I left
The gods told y’all to guard ya neck you face ya worst fear
U gonna third eye, second nose and third ear
Fourth leg and fifth arm drank a fifth of Tiger Bone
Gambled with life I just couldn’t leave the dice alone
Mutant powers in effect without the side effect
It’s now or nev... I live my life like there’s an hour left
With a legacy’s to overpower death remember when I ate cereal mixed with milk from a cows breast
No longer Kelogg, Napoleonic tell-all
Biographic sledge hammer that’ll knock ya head off
See it rolling down ya shoulder blade
That’s what’s you get for culture rape
Now ya inner organs turn to vulture bait
Formulate a plan to save mankind
How many times I’ve been told I’m out my damn mind
Anti-establishment I’m not the one to stand-by
I’m short but me coming up short is a damn lie
Spit quotes more famous than Pinky’s tan line
Pull up to ya block like a Mickey Ds franchise
Expand out I seen ya play ya man out
Turned ya back on your people now tell me how it panned out
Never went the spam route my regular can stand out
I’m just another unwelcomed guest in Uncle Sam's house

Napoleon Da Legend [hook x2]

Don't mean to rain on your parade
Take a swig of this elixir sure to take away your pain
Wash it all down, ya lenses seem tainted
In a form of a dream woke up and then create it
