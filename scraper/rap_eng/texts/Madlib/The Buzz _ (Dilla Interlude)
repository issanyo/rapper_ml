Hook
Tell Me What The Buzz About
Tell Me What The Buzz About
4x

Verse 1
I Be Buzzing When I Hear My Name
Switch Lanes, Neva Changed, Bitch I've Been The Same
It's a Shame
The Way Muthafuckas Try To Frame Or Proclaim
Tryna Spark a Flame
Passing Rumors Like Dame
Yeah
Its Quite Lame
I Try To Stay Relevant, But Get No Fame
They'd Rather Spend Cash On a Chain
Change The Game
Like 11, I'm Strange
Trigger Itch Like The Mange
Yuck
Nasty Bitches Need To Clean Up
Nowadays, Peeps Follow
So They Team Up
In Reality, They Put Me Down
So I Dream Up
I'm On Guerrilla Warfare
So I Sneak Up
Bitch
I Switch My Flow Like a Light
Smokin On The Bud
Plus I'm Sippin On The Sprite
I'm High Like a Kite
Take Flight At The Night
I Reached a Great Height
With My Brothers, Yeah That's "Wright"
I Make Jokes Bout Airplanes
Imported Cocaine, Rogaine, From Ukraine
They Say I Popped Off, So Call Me Champagne
I Try To Seek Peace, Call Me Hussein
French Boy, Write Rhymes, Call Me Montaigne
I Gotta Hold Back, Its Time To Constrain
Vishnu Yeah You Know Me From The South
And I Just Told You What The Buzz About
Bitch

Verse 2
RIP Jay Dee
One Of The Greatest Producers To Ever Be
He Changed The Game, With The MPC
Makin Beats, So Peeps Can Get Off Of They Seats
Madlib On The Track
He Takin It Back
This Shit So Addicting
We Call It Music That's Crack
That's That
I Love To Spit Facts
Trash Rappers Spit Raps
That's Whack
That's a Fact
They Should Get Clapped
I Spit Raps On a Beat And They Listen
You Know I'm The Villian, I Be Killin Competition
