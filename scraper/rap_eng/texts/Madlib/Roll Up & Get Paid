[Intro: Var]
This is, not your, garden, variety
Variety!
This is not...

[Hook: Var]
Let the la la come in
The ganja I love it
Enhance our minds
Then dance in time
Or let's just undress these fancy dimes
These fancy dimes..

[Chorus: Var]
The holly got a nigga high
Hit it hock a rhyme!
The holly got a nigga high
Hit it hock a rhyme!
The holly got a nigga high
Hit it hock a rhyme
When I die bury me wit my Legos
Just a young nigga, trying to get pesos
Just a young nigga, trying to get pesos
When I die bury me wit my Legos
Just a young nigga
Tryna get pesos!

[Verse 1: Var]
I transcend from a land dimmed by The Man
Who got the lighter man? This new tree hints of vitamins
Inhale the minerals
Insert subliminals
Because I could send shots but I don't drink
What you don't think my quotes stink of the finest highness?
Queen Elizabeth sipping cris in my private flying whip
Jet life nigga
You want to play with them Giants at MetLife nigga?
Get your head right nigga
No concussion
There is no discussin'
Why the fuck I'm cussin'
Fuck the cushion
Y'all pillow talking I puffing the kush and
Pushing a zip and
Really, not really but this dope shit
And y'all not focused on what I write

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Neco]
Y'all was screaming YOLO like you ain't know
Speaking on life's limits, when you ain't even at that bitch ankles
I'm high as Jesus headband
Playing, King James, 21
Make it take it, those the rules of the game?
Shout out to Logz though
The Underdog, that's promo
There's high expectations when shooting stars are on your logo
My only competition get the features pro Bono
Y'all want my problems well, really that's a no no
At least that's what Simon says and this is just child's play
The quiet game I swear your weeds as loud as Silent Jay
But the loudest in the room is usually the brokest
I bet the brokest be the first to quote it

[Refrain]
All I, see is, green
Money, marijuana, trees

[Hook]

[Outro]
"You want to rob banks?"

"I'm not saying I want to rob banks. I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we've been doing...

...Fuck it, forget it. We're out of it"

"Well what then, day jobs?"

"Not in this life."
