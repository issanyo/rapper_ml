Ladies and Gentlemen, Welcome to Violence
The word and the act, while violence cloaks itself in a plethora of disguises
Its favourite mantel still remains sex (sex, sex)
Violence devours all it touches, its voracious appetite rarely fulfilled
Yet violence doesn't only destroy, it creates and moulds as well (moulds as well)
Let's examine closely then this dangerously evil creation, this new breed
But a word of caution, handle with care-don't drop your guard
This rapacious new breed prowls both alone and in packs
Operating at any level, any time, any where and with any body..
Who are they?
(Who are they?
Who are they?
Who are they?...)
