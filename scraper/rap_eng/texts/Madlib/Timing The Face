Uh. The interlude for a great dude. Make new plans when I'm traveling to the great moon

Never realized what i had in life, til'i saw the kid get shot about thrice. Then they dashed off into the night
Shot back a few times to keep chasers out of sight, thought it was alright. Caught a month later after getting into a fight
Chased down, but finally gave up at the dogs' bights
Thought, they'd win, and they might, if the only witnesses didn't snitch on them about twice. Sneaky boys like mice, bought gun with a good price, all in the name of love of vice

Life's a bitch, oh shit, why did they do it? Probably cause they needed a reason to buy a new clip. A new clip?
Bullshit. Maybe they needed to make a name and no longer be a minor nuisance... in this shitty place that we call Earth.
Trynna live my life like a baby fresh out of birth. Pure soul, turned hole driving in a little hurse

Stuff in abundance so I'm rain dancing in a wet shirt
The rebirth of an east bird, say Swami will never be heard. But i don't give one, cause it's all for my ears to be heard. Listening to a bunch of lines being blurred.

Double entendre, like "damn, i feel you" oh word? if you felt me, you'd feel the pain i've been through. Seeing your friends die and your grandma's body too? How about having a brother dead, and the name given to you? Or getting the E, but God never giving you the "Lou?" And if you don't, well now you do

I'm not summer time, summer time fine, summer time rhymes, with the summer time lines, in the summer time, meant to make my summer time shine, cause i hate summer time. Cause' i stay home and just rhyme, and just waste my time, instead of going outside and being live. Just stuck inside the Hive

Jomie Querl Nation Crew fuck them all too, cause in the end the only person there will be you. Keeping my raps closed, Hunger Game's Rue. Now a days, I'm happy, love now what i chase. Can stare into your lifetime... so I'm busy Timing Your Face, Bitch
