Just cuz you got game don't mean you should be a player
Cuz sometimes it ain't so simple just to say ill see you later
Not tryna be a hater, I'm just speaking from experience
This happened back in high school so I gotta change the year we in
Two o double one, I'd been talking to this blonde right?
Hoping I could get it in, I'm thinking she'll respond right
So it started looking like I'd lay her down on prom night
This would have happy end if everything had gone right
Soon it started seeming like she might want something more than sex
It sent my day to hell when I woke up to a good morning text
I thought she knew the deal, now this shit is getting muddy
I want a cutty buddy but she saying that she love me
I should've let that candle burn, instead I helped the flame grow
I'm going out to lunch with her and calling her my angel
Prom night comes and my lady doesn't hesitate
Baby made that booty drop like cash in a collection plate
Before the clock struck midnight we were kissing in the limousine
When I got inside her could've sworn that I was in a dream
Woke up when she asked me bout the next time we would chill
Cuz the question wasn't when it was will



Then I didn't speak to you for something like a week or two
You said you were my baby so I started playing peek a boo
Cuz I don't really need a boo I'm headed off to school
And a long distance relationship's what I ain't tryna do
I wished I could apologize but I ain't wanna face the hate
What I'm gonna say to you "Girl everybody makes mistakes?"
I couldn't stand to hit you with some cliche shit
So the days turned to weeks and I ain't say shit
If playing chicks was murder then the system would've killed me
So I fled the scene cuz I knew that I was guilty
Girl I feel so filthy, talking like I was a different guy
But I was only spitting lies to get inside your hips and thighs
I'm glad to hear you're getting by I hope you find a better man
One who makes you smile and treats you better than I ever can
I got what I was looking for but now we'll never talk again
And I can't be too proud of that, I gotta take a walk of shame..
