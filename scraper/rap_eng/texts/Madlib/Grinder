[Verse]
I've been tripping on the beat so much I think I'm slow
Reap sowed flows I've done before
It's a new low, and ya'll tolerant to snorting milk
No lactose, she said I'm sweet like galactose
Revolt her in the backbone, and my clothes cost me 10 times 44
The baddest flow, wearing calico's
My dick a fishing pole, when I row her boat
And I shoot on her like the alamo
Paddle the hoes, like a saddle, mazes in catacombs
Through thick and thin white like cups made of silicone
Ya'll are but chaperones to the microphone
Pick it up, drop it back, like you mailing foes
Grind piss poor, wrist on, drinking bottles of crystal
Clear with a pistol, armed, guns used to end like elbows
Lay low, making a anecdote, escrow cause' I'm a schizo
The anthem making prancer, taste his venison in Tampa
There's no circumstances of these pansies
Probably from Kansas making advances
They panic and chances so when I plan the canvas
Like a skinny twig I branch, and break, when I sample
Or plan this stanza shit, like I drum the symbol
I steal, and step, and play rap like I band it
Grind clansman, playing in the pots and pans again, damn
