[Verse: 1]

Wake up, put my shit on and i go to school
Clothes new, fresh pressed, yes i'm looking cool
Ride the bus thinking bout a trifling woman
Gossiping bitches say she sucked 4 niggas up
At the damn same time, she couldn't get enough
No strings attached benefits,  she was in love
Thinking to myself,  she must have a reason
Seeing is believing,  guess we need to have a meeting

[Verse: 2]

One day, i was walking through the hallway
This girls books got knocked down
But she kept a straight face
The kids who did it started laughing as they walk away
Helped her get her shit up, i asked if she was okay
Said she used to this type of abuse
In my mind i'm wondering how long until she get a noose
Face full of bruises
Marks on her arms
Said with a smile, those drugs must keep you calm huh
She smiled back, what are you gonna judge me too?
Naw i don't know the things you been through
I'm not a saint by any means on my soul
Life is a play and the maker handed me a role
In this world, i wasn't born perfect, and neither were you
Devils in red dresses have the best perfume
Let me show you what this friendship shit mean
Give me your hand, stand up, walk with me

[Verse: 3]

I was the only motherfucker she could talk to
She told me bout how them niggas rode the train on her caboose
Her father popping bottles always in his fucking sorrow
That's why she got fresh bruises for tomorrow
He resent her since she look like her mother
She left his ass for a better significant other
That nigga isn't a father, he's a bitch with a dick
His daughter tired of putting up with the bullshit
So she told me she was gonna turn her life around
She had her eyes set, going for that cap and gown
Got clean from all them drugs she found solace in
And Didn't pick it up when they call again
It was good until she got splattered on a car hood
The driver and his friends was wasted coming from a party
Gone too soon,  she wasn't meant to be clean
Now only her essence walks with me


[Verse: 4]

Its been a long time since i thought about her
I just had to keep it moving i'm living without her
Taken from the world with nothing good done
The reaper is silent then its gone
They wouldn't let her change her habits, not a single one
Look within, thinking will i change myself?
Don't think i can
Does that mean i'm going against what she wanted to achieve?
With all the good will i have in my being
Nothing will change, all i can say is sorry
