[Verse 1]
And I just keep on going
Remincing about the past from the night to the morning
And I just keep on flowing,knowing that I got it
Everyday is a good day when you got money in yo pocket
And you know that your friends are right beside ya
My homies are like brothers and they be right or die too
And they be dressin fly too
And they know that I'm the guy too
Life is really good when you got your reasons to stay
I keep my head strong knowing my homie died the other day
And I just pray, just to see another day
But I know it's in my faith, that I'm gonna fade away
That be crazy ain't it, knowing you can be living life and then die the next minute
I said, that be crazy ain't it, knowing you can be living life and die the next minute

[Hook]
So I started thinking,that I can lose my life in an instant
Would my image diminish and my legacy go missing
So Ima live life cuz I can lose it in a minute
So I started thinking, that I can lose my life in an instant
Would my image diminish and my legacy go missing
