[Verse]
Royal in gold, probably out jacket teamsters
Leaning with my – on my arm like I'm gangster
If I die, tell God I’m tryin' to meet Eazy
Until that, there ain't a way to thank him
Been living these days out
Back when I was seven rocking Jordans and Jordans
Ain’t tryin' to see no reverend, Stacy Adams
On white crackers and wine, I'm on my after church
So does twenty-five cents, sit and lose your mind
Sending lyrics out to my brothers doing time, hold the spirit
Through my lyrics when I rhyme, sunshine city, skyline
One-o-ten to the five, one-o-one when I'm spun and the five when I'm high
I use to sleep inside my ride by the big bank downtown
Dream about getting a surround sound
I heard the niggas on the block got the pound and pounds
And all the wheels on the truck go round and round, ayo
World trade raps with me, fucking up down
Rap City acting like we never put it down
Never be a town that can clown like we did
Snoop killed New York, they actin' like we did
Pac got shot and they actin' like we did
Lil Kim locked and they think Lil C snitched, please
Tell cousin we Blood and he a Crip
Weed, whips, weather, and women, westside
And I reside
