Please baby no more parties in LA
Now I'm out in Houston like I'm Dikembe
They flew me out to the A
I'm feeling like a Hawk
With music ya'll sitting ducks
I'm sitting pretty, Rosa Parks
I just can't believe no names thinking that they celebrities
They get double attention cause they implanted double d's
And now I'm on the scene
Took Uber, no limousine
Rented they cars and bags but couldn't rent self- esteem
I was in the hills like I was Axel
But South Central was my Holy place, the Tabernacle
They wanted out but to them is where I traveled
My side was paved ways, they taught me about gravel
I ain't been inspired since Nicki was on the stoop
Kobe had the fro and was number 8 when he hooped
Kanye was dropping out and knew that he wouldn't flop
And Game said hate it or love the underdogs ontop
Sheesh
I felt like I could relate
Now music is watered down, don't have the same taste
Rappers are actors, don't know which one I face
And I ain't tryna' preach but now I'm feeling like Mase (tell em')
Why I'm overlooked by those who underneath me? (Tell em"
They hittin' rock bottom but still getting that seaweed (Tell em')
Truth is hard to find, don't expect for them to see me
I'm tryna' help rap stay alive, word to BeeGee's
But what do I know?
I ain't Hollywood enough cause I don't have a car note
What do I know?
The game is to play dirty, I ain't never liked a cockroach
