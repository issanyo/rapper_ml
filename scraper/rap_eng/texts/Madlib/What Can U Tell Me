[Verse I: Frank Nitt]
I think I’m on the verge of greatness
That I even got the courage to say this
Should be enough to solidify my spot, but it’s not
So, I find myself reaching for the top
I’m here motherfuckers, welcome to my epilogue
The boy, Frank Nitt, up in this bitch, Imma set it off
Pen game crazy, Madlib ridiculous
The plan is to setup shop and count the Benjamin’s
Before we finish, we get to spinnin’ the spinnin’
Been gone for an hour, y’all still like, “Wait a minute”
We already spinnin’ talking wheels on the whip
Get that what time to spend, so I feel on her tit
And that’s ‘cause she like it
I’m about to take over the world and she excited
So, please don’t fight it, and you can come ride with us
And when you ride with the boys in lush, then it goes like

[Verse II: MED]
I appear out of thin air, celebrate like bringing in new year
Same dealer when putting on new gear (fresh)
What I letter address to a hater is, “Say cheers and toast to the upmost”
Snatch a mic, run rappers like enough jokes
So, he wrote, “No he won’t”, hold time in his palm like a bag of coke (no lie)
Honey pie, ass cantaloupe, need a fix from the antidote
No tricks, or smokescreens (watch) this is the street dream
From the block, plane drop overseas, what can you tell me
Frank and MED, like J Dilla said, “Make them envy”
