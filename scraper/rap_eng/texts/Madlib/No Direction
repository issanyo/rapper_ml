No Direction
By Orlando Mclean

[Intro]
Oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh
Come on now get down come on now get down
Come on now get down come on now get down

[Verse 1]
From north to west an south to east
We roam the streets wit no direction
Ah huh ah huh
We hold our heats don’t know defeat won't go to sleep
With no protection with no protection
Ah huh ah huh
No it a’int hard to say from the God self we far away
And the way we are today just makes me want to say
Get up off of your seat throw on them beats
An hear me speak you’l learn a lesson you'll learn a lesson

[Chorus]
So come on now get down one time with me two times with me
Say come on now get down i could take you there let me take you
There
So come on now get down one time with me two times with me
I could take you there let me take there i could take you there let
Me take you there you there

[Verse 2]
From north to west an south to east
We roam the streets wit no direction
Ah huh ah huh
Blood stains the street enraged police to say the least
Theres no progression no progression
Ah huh ah huh
No it a’int hard to se from the God self we far away
And the way we are today just makes me want to say
Get up off of your seat an on your feet
Yearn to read or learn to listen learn to listen

[Chorus]
So come on now get down one time with me two times with me
Say come on now get down i could take you there let me take you
There
So come on now get down one time with me two times with me
I could take you there let me take there i could take you there let
Me take you there you there
I could take you there let me take there i could take you there let
Me take you there you there
I could take you there let me take there i could take you there let
Me take you there you there
