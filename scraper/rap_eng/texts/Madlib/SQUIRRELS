[Verse 1: Kai Bowman]
Kai get the money like squirrels
They just tryna catch a squirrel like squirrels in this mad world
Ate custard got from Earl
Funny thing is he is actually a girl
I am one of those devils
Who create those foods you like to call Revels
I am on another level
I'm also made of metal
You know who likes bikes?
Mr Sykes
From the movie Shark Tale
My pet is just a dark snail
His name is Larry
Reminds me of Gary
Shut up guys
I'm Kai, yeah
Please cry
