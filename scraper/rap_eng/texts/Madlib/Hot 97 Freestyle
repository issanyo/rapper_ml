Lol though, eyes the color of Elmo
Sharp tongue cuts through the air like strings of a cello
Dead eye like a jumper in 2k13 with Melo
Cause it's a hit everytime I shoot these thoughts in my cell phone
Plans to have the word "greatness" on my headstone
Spit a verse for skeptics turn around to see their heads blown
Back like a Pez, where they peak I still progress
Got a very private life cause I don't mess with verbal feds
I tell em all believe in me, really why not?
After 5 drops my opponents are looking Psyshocked
So show love for a talented cat
Who's only gimmick's being average outside of these raps
These flaccid passive slackers lacking depth outside their acts
That's why everybody lately's sounding the same on their tracks
So I give them no empathy developed the epiphany
I got a mob behind me, other crews are human centipedes
Born in 92 but rep DreamSquad til infinity
K double T Task Force supporting heavily
Monkey goon squad force 9 waiting steadily
So I don't gotta lift a finger to address an enemy
Even amputees ain't counting me out
And if you're thinking different babysit my kids in your mouth
Without a doubt, game over, bars to leave a drunk dame sober
This is what happens when McLennon eats a flamethrower
