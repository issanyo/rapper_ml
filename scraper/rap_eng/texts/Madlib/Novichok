Your pressure points are my bulleyes, about to have fun notice the time fly, with your third eye
And I watch your mind die from disfixiation by you soft rhymes
Smothered by your own words, irony like asking the blind to see the time
Notice that the americas corruption can't stop my destruction, I actually need it without I can't function
I'll have you help me out, then stab you in the back, and I'll keep at it till your bleeding like a hemophiliac
You spit flames? I blow up supernovas in seconds, and I've been using lyrics as weapons
All you niggahs do is have defecation out your face hole, I'll use constellations to smack you with a ladle
Your niggas work at the cornrows and waves, but you'll be an umpire when you catch the fade
Then you family will dread you death, have them looking for you brains and braids but you lost both like your respect
This is the prophecy kid building the equality bridge, because in few years without me people won't know what equality is
I need three Nobel prizes for living these dreams, past lives were archdukes and kings
Emperors and empires need to thank me a lot, rather help the world by being a God
Is that odd? To want to want overtake continents, I feel like the white man before broken promises
Roll to the White House with a bazooka, because its still the same 48th street intruder
People get shocked when they hear my tone, call the presidents phone then scream Viva La Revoluc√≠on
These rappers feel to obscene, and think that their gonna make their dream? Bitch please, you brain must of been your keys, I love the flow that kills. Novichok stream
