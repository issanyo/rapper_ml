Smack a rapper faster than a actor turning rapper, or vice versa, slice him on a verse, then put him in an all black hearse huh/
I’m murderous like Shyne, with the Biggie voice.  Is he choice? Everytime
Jimmy guaranteed to get girls really moist, Duncan Hines
Real sweet when readjusting spines/
I only ask that you collapse your mind, right into mine/
Come near my breast piece, hear my heart speak, feel it confined/
Endangered chess piece, these combating lines
Turn to bishop, take your rook, steal your queen/
Before you lift up to take a look, and peep the scene/
I already come very heave armed/
And yes very, very, very, calm/
I swoop in with a group of pawns/
Then I politely ask ya to lay your king face down on the lawn/
Peace then I’m gone/
Psyche, now I’m back, to beat you with a spiked bat/
And just like that, add insult to injury/
So now you’ll think twice for trying to injure me/
Do you know who I is?  The E.L.E?
Better ask your kids, about the weaponry/
The word skills exhibit excellency/

Caliber is of Excaliber, naw scratch that/
My caliber is calico, aimed at your hard hat/
Ripping through your skull, burrowing through brain/
These words are heavy weaponry you niggas can’t escape!/
Better check the method, exquisite record/
Nine, Nine, Nine, thousand, Nine, Nine, Nine kills/
That’s only one kill short of the goal of mine, mill/
Ill disposition, desperado on a mission/
Bandito Banderas like zorro, I mark my territory bring sorrow, in poetical purgatory you’ll wallow/
There’s no tomorrow.  I call this freestyle Cthulhu, rising from the ancient depths coming just to hurt you/
Sacrifice a virgin for her virtue, it won’t save you, when Cthulhu is already coming to enslave you/
In a bayou, near a swamp, it’ll enter into phase two, “What choo want?”/
It’ll ask as if it doesn’t know.  “I just want some real records yo”./
Request granted.  Your mind is blown/
