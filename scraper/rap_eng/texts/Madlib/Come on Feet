[Sample of Melvin Van Peebles]
Come on feet x5

[Verse 1, Quasimoto (Melvin Van Peebles)]
Come on feet, cruise for me (do your thang)
Trouble ain't no place to be!
Come on feet, do ya thang, aw nah (you all know why he's gained)
Come on legs, come on run (guilty? what'd he say you've done!?)
Come on knees, don't be mean
Come on knees, cause that ain't the first red you've ever seen
Come on feet, do ya thang (come on baby!)
Don't cop out on me (come on baby!)
Don't give in on me
Come on legs, come on cruise for me

[Verse 2, Quasimoto (Melvin Van Peebles)]
Come on feet, cruise for me
Come on run! (who put the bad mouth on me?)
Anyway the way, I pick them up and put them down
Even if they got my name on it, won't catch me now (won't catch me now)
Never put us in some cold ass ground
Sure was dark, never been out this late (mama!)
Anyway, safe and sound but we broke the olympic two twenty
Cross country or something (you're lonely)
Whatever happened to the sun? Sure gone away
Sure blacker than a landlords soul
Must have run all day (Yeah, must have run all day)
Must've run all day (sure have a bitch)
(Must've run all day)
Come on feet, cruise for me
Come on feet, come on run (cruise for me)
Come on feet (Come on feet)
Come on feet, come on run (come on run)

WCET
Thank you for the station, 88.1 FM
I was going through the crazy shit man [I can’t really call it the cat?], Quasimoto
I played a few tunes yesterday to sponsor
Real cool, they digged it
And the new album came in, it’s at your local store, it’s Quasimoto: The Unseen
I'mma play a couple of tunes for y'all [?]
If y'all sleep, you know, you’re gonna have dreams about this
This is WCET 88.1 FM, midnight hour
