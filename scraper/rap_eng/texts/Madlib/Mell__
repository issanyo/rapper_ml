[Verse 1: Jack The Spitter]
Yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow on the chain
They say i'm hella mello swallow the lyrics on the stage
Belch meanings, whether i mean it or not, i still face
The race of the rats, i rap great
Music music music music music's getting made
Don't confuse me with confucious even they we're both the same
I'm a loser with stupid lyrics and life to live and pray
Tho i don't believe in god i believe god can get me saved
Ratings never mattered whether good or kill the plays
Had a positive outlook, a smile on my face
I'm the mediator, black world, a white smile
Have a listen with the kid and his business once in a while
Teeth glisten, a shillings worth of my time
A meek mission missing important lines, of mine fine (fuck you)
Yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow on the face
Golden shower when i leave the empowered dead with the slaves
It go it go zippo zipper baggie of the strain
Strain my vocals four loko cans in my veins, i proclaim
I got too many pounds of rhymes racking my brain
Leaving the lames, in the sand with cheep grains and band names
Bland shame, they all the same and probably never mattered
Me i'm jack white, cheddar the deli platter
Thought of me as lacking when i'm really just funny
My accountant told me that i had too much money (what)
It's never sunny here, cuz the clouds don't fade
Fuck with my clique, you fuck where great ain't
I lick em in the  waist where they can't slang
Leave bitches spirit disfigured cuz i can't remember her name
Fuck if my cursing has worsened i'm just a vowel in
I went from murdering beats to peace Shaolin
I kung fu every dude who had a death wish
Make these quarterbacking bitches maybe toss a towel in
