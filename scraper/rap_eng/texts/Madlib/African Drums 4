[Napoleon Da Legend verse 1]
Adamantium monks up the bunk
With the pump, body in the trunk smelling like skunk
Static to the selecta claim the sector
It’s a threat like Anti-Balaka versus Seleka
Tribal wars warrior clash and lion’s roar
Another dies and then a child is born the paths torn
Stabbed with a black thorn that’s the norm
Digging up some diamonds from the ground and pass em on
While Imams and pastors mourn those who past on
We keep tackling the day with our mask on
Bronze and copper playing soccer
Tuma Basa crafting like George Washington Carver
The saga 20 in 10 off like Tabata
Secrets of the Kaballah eating rice with Mataba
It’s deep like Sound of drum that shake the ground
And walls and feeds the soul only found in the slums

[Napoleon Da Legend verse 2]
Chop the head of a chicken u see the blood drip
Seasonal rain you can see how deep the mud gets
We throwing rocks at the trees to pop mangos
So hot fuck a sneaker rocking flip flops or sandals
Cop some bread from the corner store for my grandma
My moms never met her pops that’s my grandpa
Labattoir looking like a scene from Avatar
Burn Babylon the french tried to grab it all
Take it back to the roots that’s where the proof lives
Some of y’all cry like Babies when the truth hits
The myth the legends the gift the essence
The "it", the trick was for us to think we separate
And slowly erode the thread that connects us
And Disconnect us from the soul and infect us
My heart is in mainland where you don’t need a spray tan
Eating plantains and eggplants, Africa
