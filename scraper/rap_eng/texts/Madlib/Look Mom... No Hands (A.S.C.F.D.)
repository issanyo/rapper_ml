Look mom no hands
These sucker emcees better change their plans
Or better yet their sound
We don't them, we want the sky and the ground

You want some monkey bull shit
You know monkey see monkey do basic
I'm at the bar wasted
First the rum went down and the coke chased it
That's two strikes, you two face it
You said you got heart, I think you misplaced it
That's just one of the things
And when you find it you latch on and embrace it
Niggas know I built with the face lift
So they wait for my albums with spaceships
I sorta got the poisonous punch
Let the vision of the afterlife destroy your lunch
Rock that (Come-on)
Rock that (Come-on)
The niggas in hip-hop want the mic back (come-on)
The niggas in the street want their life back
I don't think Mount Everest could top that

Look mom no hands
These sucker emcees better change their plans
Or better yet their sound
We don't them, we want the sky and the ground
Look mom no hands
These sucker emcees better change their plans
Or better yet their sound
We don't them, we want the sky and the ground
We hear no evil, see no evil
All we need know is to speak no evil
Regardless of who I'm going to save my people
It all comes down to you

If I'm the son of a gun I came from a cannon
When all my children aim not start landing
I'm at my falcon crest
For you to battle me you gotta do your best
That'll cost you eight mill
Even Steve Austin wasn't this ill
I don't gotta pull up my pants
I just stand their froze in my b-boy stance
You gonna feel my flow
Shit, I'm the last the dragon can't you see my glow
Piece to Quasimo cause he puff the dro
???? is like African snow
And that's unheard of
You move like a snake with the heart of a dove
You got the moonwalk all you need is a glove
You there is a care when Atlas Shrugged
