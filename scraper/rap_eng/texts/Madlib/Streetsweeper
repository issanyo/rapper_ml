[Intro]

[Verse 1: Samuel T. Herring]
Wear my cap in two ways, you're fronting for a backwards crowd
Orioles for the win, half a second half a mile
Resurrect the ape in men
And take their daughters out for beef
Dream a circle a sphere, then I paint my masterpiece
Half asleep, like Van Gogh on death row
Just assholes and elbows, rented Benz, platinum demos
Kinship -- there is none, when MCs get down to it
Lounge music, that's all these suckers do: lounge through it
Listen now stupid, push your life
But you ain't pushing nothing but the pipe
On young'ns minds, tell your story
So we can see what you're made of
I killed friends with bags that I gave away, barely
Made a penny, but I took away
Now my hands and head be white
Rusty chevy on blocks, a '52
People think I'm 52 cause the lines in my face a stone wall
Gold jaw, couldn't cut these lines with a bonesaw
In my life, I'm just tryna follow teachers aim
Trynna find knowledge of self, and blow the speakers mane
There's more to life than just rhymes money and diamond chains
But all I know is lines, money and reefer pains
What's your aim?
The streetsweeper, I should be deeper
