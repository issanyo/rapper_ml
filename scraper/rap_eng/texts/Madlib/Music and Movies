[Verse 1] Madchild

Yo
Im a tattooed scooter boy that rides a skateboard
Steal it if I have to
Come back and pay for it
Need a second chance, every night I pray for it
Broken every branch but my minds a rain forest
I bulldozed over the ones that loved me
Full nose froze and my lies are ugly
Devil tried to push and shove me
I'm in the park with my dogs, blue skies above me
Laying they were playin in the grass, had a awesome time
And to think I almost lost my mind
As we jumped into the car something crossed my mind
Best day I had in years didn't cost one dime
Think about that shit for a second


[Interlude] Madchild

Fuck a club
Take it in
Music and movies
A message

[Moka Only]
Word up

[Verse 2] Moka Only

We at the same place
Tryin' to go the same pace as ten years back
My ten year of rap never really changed phase
Well maybe just a smidgen
Distractions, abstractions
And saying how decisions Change whole course mere instant
Wanna be free from it all like infant
Definite Imprint
Get rid of the deficit limerence
My hands are the slime cause this time is different
(For real) Same paging it. Mad we was made to spit
Magazines racing it. Tragedy replacing it
Pure glory. Self served story
Hit a bit of piff, Get a stiff then serve [?] Nah
My music always comes first
We was young first then we come till we burst if we lucky
And indeed I am
Moka O, Madchild, What we feed our fans
We got the raw (Scratches)
You know we got that raw shit

Ya
No lie
No horse shit. no time for none of that
Ya
Bring it on back
In for the count
Never out
