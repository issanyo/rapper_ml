[Verse I: Phats Bossalini]
I'm not your normal your rap artist beg your pardon
Turn you to a target cause you fucking with the Seargant
You gotta feel me dog I'm more than starvin
Plus my hustle's sick and the flow's retarded
Couple mixtapes and the flow's on the market
Now my shit bangin from the burbs the projects
My pants saggin and I'm boasting and bragging
Shots of patron yeah we go for the gallon
Think of this picture me in the phantom
The G-5 make a easier landing
We can't stand him
Thats what the haters say
But I'm good money like a Michael Jordan fadeaway
Pray for the day I get this money on the straight away
I'm trying to feed my family for God sakes
But these are the brakes and the streets filled with snakes
And thats why I keep time with the cartier

[Chorus: Krondon]
This lion’s missing his heart
Bark like a dog
Knowing you’re the first one that the cops call
This lion’s missing his heart

[Verse II: Phil da Agony]
Diverse
Waking up the dead with a live verse
Small fry niggas die first
Do a live search
Of your fave five, top five dead or alive
Big and Pac, then you got Nas
So who’s four and five?
Jay Z
If you over 40 then it’s Kool Moe Dee
SIKE!
You know you like Em despite being white
Some say the 18th letter dropped the most gems
So number five must be Rakim or Eminem
Ice and Scareface
Snoop Dogg or 50 cent
Kweli and Prodigy
Alchemist and evidence
Was touring with Redd and Meth
Now those are some of the best niggas on the east coast like
Rae and Ghost
Can’t forget KRS
Slick Rick, Dougie Fresh
DOC, Andre 3000 that’s the best
Common sense and Lil Wayne, LL Cool J
The best hooks got to Nate Dogg and T Pain
Big Pun, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane
With Scoob and Scrap, throw in Big L
Now who fucking with that?

[Chorus: Krondon]
Bark like a dog
Niggas only act hard in they back yard
This lion’s missing his heart
Bark like a dog
Knowing you’re the first one that the cops call
This lion’s missing his heart

[Verse III: Montage One]
We track beaters, with 8 channel heat-seekers
16 bars combined with guitar riffs
MP programmed to swing on every 4/5th
Timing is everything, king of the first verse
Master of the last one
Usually never have one
Written, but fully automatic with the spittin
Black alley-cat with no kittens
Dolo on my night walk
Pun told killas carry chalk and erasers
And stay on you niggas like tracers
You pull a hamstring
I pull your whole card
We tend to bogard
Later give your mic back
And tell you Imma need it tomorrow
Cause it's like that
Matter of fact, what you got on my 40 sack
Phil got the purple pack
Kron with the honey wrap
Backwood ???????
Kief makes the lungs collapse
Nigga we jock when we smoke this shit
And bitches at the front the of my stage
With they tit out
Brain in the green room
Everybody get out
The only nigga you know, you never put a hit out
But still pick up a mic and blow your fucking shit out

[Chorus: Krondon]
Bark like a dog
Niggas only act hard in they back yard
This lion’s missing his heart
Bark like a dog
Knowing you’re the first one that the cops call
This lion’s missing his heart
