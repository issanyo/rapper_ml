[Intro]

[Verse 1: Swami Netero]
Why you even
Trying to do this to yourself?/
Put your rhymes back on the shelf
Before I empty out your shell/
I'm sick as cancer cells
I'll cause your capillaries to swell/
As your brain matter expels
Leaking blood on your lapel/
Man the demon belial
Don't even dare to mess with me/
I got the highest next to me
Ready to burn your effigy/
Don't ever step to me
Unless you got a death wish/
Don't need no gun protection
I use my tongue to check kids/
I ain't the one to mess with
I got bottled up emotions/
And I'm about to start exploding
On your crew in just a moment/
Defeating me is hopeless
I'm a lyrical assassin/
Smashing faggots who imagine
That I'll ever be a has been/
Cause rapping is my passion
I ain't got nothing else/
I ain't in it for the wealth
I'm just in it for my health/
I'd die without a realm
Where I could go release the stress/
Where I don't got to impress
Anyone or be the best/
Don't know what to expect
I'm just expressing how I'm feeling/
Don't need to make a million
I just want someone to feel it/
Cause while you're on the ceiling
With more problems than a Ford/
I'm just sitting on the floor
Kicking back and being bored/
Cause more I can't afford
But I ain't poor, because I'm satisfied/
You ain't even happy
I'm content to reach the afterlife/
You wasted half your life
Collecting things you'll leave behind/
I'm changing people's lives
So I'll be remembered when I die/
