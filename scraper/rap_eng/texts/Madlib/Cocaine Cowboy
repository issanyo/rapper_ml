[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Detroit desperado, wrap [?] in a red El Dorado
My lifestyle's Fortune 500
While niggas just a crumb inside a world where the bread run it
I'm 16 from the slums
Street light reflect off the barrel of the gun
We expect death, lucky to reach puberty
Learned in the streets public school wasn't teaching me
Graduate with honours as a cocaine scholar
I sell nouns like pounds, birds like birds
Clowns ain't heard, words I serve
Spit like nicks, rhyme like dimes
Roll a dollar bill up snort these lines
Fresh off the curb on a quest for the bacon
Flip an occupation on the final destination
Daily operation, currency chasing
Got no patience
Daily operation, currency chasing
Got no patience for the pennies I ain't waiting
Pockets getting fatter because the poetry progressed
Without a harness on on the ladder of success
[?] in the chest, brew in the belly
Liquor in the kidney counting money in the tele
