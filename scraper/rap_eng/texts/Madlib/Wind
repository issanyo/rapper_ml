[Chorus]
'cross the room (across the wind)
I hear footsteps, footsteps (again and again, oh)
Across the wind
I hear footsteps, footsteps

[Verse I]
He made all his living in the sea
Learned from his father
Who said how fine a fisherman he would be
Had a lovely wife and family
Nautical hustler
Who gave all he could to help the folks in need
On the day his life would end
He sailed out on his own
The boat capsized
Tears filled eyes he was happy he lived this long

[Chorus]
'cross the room (across the wind)
I hear footsteps, footsteps (again and again, oh)
Across the wind
I hear footsteps, footsteps
Oooooooooh

[Verse II]
Told his daughter life was like a tree
Build a foundation
So you can have something lasting centuries
Hold a joyful memory of me
So when I pass on now
I can further elevate your destiny

[Chorus]
'cross the room (across the wind)
I hear footsteps, footsteps (again and again, oh)
Across the wind
I hear footsteps, footsteps
Oooooooooh
Passing through
