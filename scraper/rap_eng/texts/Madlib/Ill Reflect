[Intro: Jay Rukas & Johnny, The MC]

Jay Rukas: This is once of my favorites, Yeoo what's good Brooks?
Johnny, The MC: Nothin' much, just chillin'
Jay Rukas: We killin' em with this hook
Johnny, The MC: Prospect Villans!
Jay Rukas: Word!

[Verse 1: Jay Rukas]

Half of the words I'm spitting you search the definition
That 90's funky rhythm most cat's ain't got
Popping out of no where, Jack-In-A-Box
Feeling hot, I'm raging and blazing, disco inferno
In the cloud of smoke I'm incognito
I keep the rubbers tight like Speedo's
If she try something slick tonight I'm gone r√°pido
Only time I shoot is at the free throw
Peep the people through the peepholes
They get vexed when I spit my writtens
It doesn't matter, I'm still gonna kill it persistent
My style and lyrics are never ending, their ascending
It's like we went from hell to heaven
It feel so pleasant cause their just progressing
You might learn a few lessons my breddren
Like adolescence and how weapons leave negus stagnant
That's one of many survival tactics
Got nice with practice, it's evident that I'm a factor
Blessed like a pastor, now contemplate me past ya
Running off fumes like NASCARs, but aiming for the stars, NASA
The tremendous vocab is impeccable
There are some things that are unforgettable
I find it quite incredible how the words keep going
On second thought, they don't show up sometimes
I used to have rhymes like dimes
But now I find their on a recline, behind my mind
Lyrics used to appear rapidly, now they seem to ease
My brain freezes and I wanna know the reason
If I don't I start cheesing, shit yeoo I start cheesing
Either I over think or the pen stops dripping ink
I tend not to blink, cause I'm too focused in
This ain't the last collaboration, when we dominating like Ronald Reagan, we raging

[Hook: Jay Rukas & Johnny, The MC]

Jay Rukas: Its a definition of a ill reflect
Johnny, The MC: To my negua Jay Rukas much respect
Jay Rukas: Brooks we're a threat, next on deck, tell em what gonna happen next

[Verse 2: Johnny, The MC]

I'mma tell these negus I got 6 million ways to rhyme, choose one
Cause I'mma take the beat out the box, and chew one
See I'm the ultimate mic guard, negua who make your life hard
Throughout my life I had traveled through blue moons and white stars
And I found Jay Rukas spitting with perfection
New York is what he's reppin'
Me and him are spitting rounds like lethal weapons
Took em' back to Earth and we had to defeat who's steppin'
Prospect Villians were made, now it's the beats we wreckin'
All hail the underground, the nineties is back now
Like WWE, I'm so Raw when I Smackdown
Bringing your whack sounds will get you jacked, clown
Hit you in your neck, in the middle of rapping, like yo finish that now
Next morning I be like, "I can't believe those nights."
When vinyls be getting scratched like Mosquito bites
Walking in the room with Jordan's like you see those flights ?
Now negus breathing on my food like you gonna eat those right?
But if you the God of rap, then I'm a atheist
I try my best to stay on top, and that's because I lack of laziness
So I'm the professor, cause when I lecture you'll gain pressure
Lose your tempers, then I have to rest ya'
Just remember there's no better
No errors, the new era is bring terror, so just surrender
And if you don't, no matter age or gender
We'll hit you with a real effect, like it's an ill reflect
