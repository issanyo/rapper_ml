[Intro Skit]

[Verse Snippet: Oh No]
Look into the depths, two steps with many men
Crept from the left, hold your breath, rest severin’
Riddlin’em, the goodness, dope fiendin’ next to ‘em
Out of last breath, but shit’s done, simpleton

[Transition]
Definitely in the house
Ox city, Professionals in this motherfucking house
Put it up, all of it
Yo listen, listen up

[Verse I: Oh No]
We always go coasting, volume to the maximum
Windows up, hot-boxing on passengers
Second hand, grab you by the neck with the stamina
Stim propid, I can’t let you slide, you back with the
Vengeance or menace it’s Madlib and Oh No
The six siblings, my spit shifting, ground shaking
Businesses is dis business, specialized in physics
And physically remove gimmicks, lyrically I kill it
With the hand able hands, the illest dismantle y’all plans
With wired colored tennis, explosion
Heads up like ram collision, damn
Y’all vision is just worth a gram, imperial
Scratch the cereal we coming to get you man
Don’t even ask who slams like Saturdays
When the masters ran wrestling Bam-Bam
Bigelow, on fire that nigga with the realest flow
Deuces up, Madlib laying the beat is criminal, what

[Verse II: Oh No]
Listen, niggas be panicking
I sky walk my days like Anakin
Debating to choose the dark or light again
In spite all the haters is tryin’em
It’s nothing, forget about 'em
We shake the spot just by riding
On and off stage I rampage
Three beats in one campaign as if I only know one way
My soul is opposite of cold, woah, so late
For the shot to the store lane, lines in the okay
Corral, western hemi-style till I’m D-O-A
I’ll O-D y’all to the face, P-O because we don’t play
My mouth by order, by coaster, your girl’s bisexual
Tryin’ to get by me closer and all I do is push the glance further
Killin' her ---- I guess I got a gang of murders
My slang is service, in serve the real in converted samples
Pieces of inverted changing out my cats financial
I branch like trees, cut up trees
Live off trees, breath oxygen, smoke up leaves
Choke up flim and spit that green with a hint of tobacco
Outlandishly, blunts rolled is all I need
With more speeds getting faster than a hundred g-forces
Rip your face off, of course call your reinforcement
This is strict nine delivering to UPS
