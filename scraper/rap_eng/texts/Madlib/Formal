I spit it cold as Jon Snow and his cronies
While they're toe deep in white walker land with no sleep
It’s awesome to be apart of all that you see
So I plan to be on farmland surrounded by ponies
Let's boogie to the sound of the clock tower ringing
Out loud to signal out that it's time to get down
And while the bombings decimate the whole the town
We can estimate the damage as it escalates now
The globe trotter who’s known to go squander his time
Without leaving his home to go wander
The star I wished upon died then a somber glow
Illuminated quietus tones I've grown fond of
The most odious rap style that's known to apes
Flows in waves but it lacks taste like low sodium
I'm at the podium to bitch and complain
In a stadium of poker-faces hoping to wane
The walls they built to grains of sand to throw flames
I got the flower power up while I was down in the drains
Now I'm here to obtain the world, simple and plain
I plan to make it in my image while the spin is the same
I'm citizen Kane's last word's mysterious lure
Give me a mic to light the way with from my furious roar
Rock from Baltics to tropics, ball pits to mosh pits
I drop kick any oppositionist’s thought
My onslaught brought down any prior preconception
That I couldn’t hold my weight unlike others who stick their necks into this fashionable business with irrational gimmicks
Who focus more on the fame while I'm surpassing my limits
The difference is so apparent to me it’s become commonplace
I finesse belittlement in ways that make to you nod and shake
We're not to blame for being condescending in the constant wake of
Who did this or who we think did that
Please avert from my direction if your hearts detached from your art
Don't drive thinking you won't crash
