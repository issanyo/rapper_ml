[Verse I]
No epidural fa sho he was born on the bedroom flo'
My god baby god was born
The state made it almost against the law
Petey Wheatstraw he was strong y'all
Beautiful father down by law and all was well
The name of the god was sung throughout the heavens
And he shined so brightly
Laughed into labor so mightily a
Soul sprung from triple dark mystery
What do we have here

[Chorus]
A born god with no fear and he's divine
Eminent through time
Original man and divine original man divine
Happens all the time original man divine original man divine and born
Born everyday alive and well oh yes

[Verse II]
Paintbrush is sound his reality is profound
And one with the maker of all
We've been blessed to share his reality on the ground
And for him we'll be forever down
And the energy that he put forth rang through the heavens
And his love for original woman shined so brightly
Who loved when the hate could be binding
Praise the the god praise the god
Praise the god praise all you that hear

[Outro]
A born god with no fear and he's divine
Eminent through time
Original man and divine original man divine
Happens all the time original man divine original man divine and born
Born everyday alive and well
Fresh from this earth
Fresh from the earth
Fresh from the earth pure indeed
Fresh from the earth pure in mind
Fresh from the earth pure indeed
Fresh from the earth pure in heart (4x)
Fresh from the earth pure indeed
C'mon and sing his praises praises (sing the praise)
