Roll me tight, kiss me dry
Then blaze me up now let's get hi-i-i-igh
Get the tray, dump the ash
Now take two pulls, then pa-a-a-ass
It's no dough on it, it's no toke in it
All day and night we puff on c-h-r-o-nic
It's no dough on it, no toke in it
All day and night we puff that c-h-r-o-nic

Goin' out to my true smokers, this one's for you
Kool'port tokin, got me lifted like a bulldozer
Superman god got em floatin'
Like I just smoked some shit from Sampson, gan' got me chokin
We be in the van rollin' off that, Cheech & Chong
Keep your bongs, I'm straight with the cognac Phillie
Want a hit, don't act silly
Unless you put five on the sack Willie
Smoke it with me if you got it
I smell it let me inhale it
Trendsetting, got a Dilla rolled for you
It's tight like fresh trim, all fluff, no stems
Think I'll put flame to it

It's no dough on it, it's no toke in it
"Ahh Mary Jane, I'll call call you later"
"gotta go into action"
"Well..."
