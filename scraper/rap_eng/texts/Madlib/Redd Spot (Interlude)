Chinese humor: Confucius say crowded elevator smell different to midget

*Audience laughs*

Mexican humor: Why does it have hair around it?
To keep it from looking like a taco

*Audience laughs*

Guess you've never seen a taco. See, they cut like this-
No, they cut like this, and then, you hold it like this so the meat won't fall out

Have you ever eaten one?

*Laughter*

You nigga! Did I ask you a question!?

*Laughter*
