[Sample]

Alright here's another song, now
You have to listen carefully
We want you to listen to the next song
I think this next song
This is about a guy who doesn't care about your health
All he cares about is
If he can get that money from you

[Verse]

Watch him eat away the masses
Brass fist ass kicking these bastards
Gas passed
Every time a nigga hits the lab
Attire monocle, suede gators, button up and khakis
Black skinny ass
Runs charities for his cash
Whoop ass like Cassius
Cashing million dollar stashes
AFLAC ducking these whack nigga's that's actin'
Told a nigga spit mics in half call it tough love
Now, when I spit nigga's get hits like seeing slug bugs
The more the merrier
Fuse short as the leg on a newborn Cairn Terrier
Ain't no comparing him, Laxx
Hierarchy life
Stationed in the underground
Nigga's falling off like the two year olds that run around
Bronchitis cardiac attack for the vocals
Mingle with the hierarchy playalistic locals
Penicillin lyrics got these nigga's feeling woozier
Middle finger to negotiations with the Lucifer
Say she my baby won't you suck it like a pacifier
Too explicit
Bet you remember him like a Zechariah, nigga
