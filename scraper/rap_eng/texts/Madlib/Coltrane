This is Herbie Hancock
You know a lot of people are into hard drugs
Like skag and downers
And what they don't really realize
How much they're playing with their bodies, their lives
And the natural abilities that they're born with
Let me tell you
You don't need that stuff to get into music
Or to get into yourself
Music is the finest high around

Why sitting here chatting with you
It brings back memories I once knew

Get off my back

And I would like to say
I wish you all very happy happy time
And you'll be hearing from me next
Very, very soon
Thank you and goodnight
Hooray for (?)
Hooray, yes that's right, that's him
Hooray for (?)
