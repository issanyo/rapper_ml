[Napoleon Da Legend verse1]
Add the math up grass roots, phasma
Charisma in my voice could be explained by my asthma
Kings plaza where my name rings like Gaza
Survivor, Messiah Rap epitomizer
When you powerful they’ll try to minimize ya
And put up advertisements to try to hypnotize ya
Soul Assata inside ya we rise up
Blocking the barrage of mirage and facades
Besides our nature is of goddesses and gods
And we cognizant of the fact they honestly a fraud
And The scheme is just ponzi written up in Kanji
Living in a fantasy like Jungle of Jumanji
Peace to Alpha Blondie and Tyken Jah Fakoly
Keeping watch of what I’m feeding in my body
Majestic like Garvey up in a car seat
God gene, my speed Mach 3 like Martin Lockheed

[Erykah Badu Hook]
Alhamdulillah Allah Jehovah
Yahweh Dios Ma'at Jah
Rastafari fyah dance, sex, music, hip-hop

It's bigger than religion
Hip-hop
It's bigger than my nigga
Hip-hop
It's bigger than the government
This one is the healer, hip-hop

[Napoleon Da Legend verse2]

Yo snakes in grass hide that right
Took the wrong path and I died that was a past life
Acquainted myself with my dark side dodge lies
Got more than 9 lives, how u think I got wise ?
This is a blueprint for you to copy
This is smart godfather logic not Luca Brasi
Not for the stupid and the sloppy
For those who bigger than chasing after groupie in the lobby
Independent thinkers who don’t follow influencers
In the media, those with high level intuition
Head is straight those who make plans and meditate
Self aware but not soft and not afraid to celebrate
Compassionate more mature than current head of state
Optimist convinced that tomorrow will be a better day
If that ain’t you? Still cool, you can listen to it too
But put 2 and 2 together and it’s really meant for you...

[Verse Erykah Badu]
We ain't dead said the children don't believe it
We just made ourselves invisible
Underwater, stove-top, blue flame scientists come out with your scales up
Get baptized in the ocean of the hungry

When niggas turn in to gods
Walls come tumblin...(aaahhh)

[Hook]
Alhamdulillah Allah Jehovah
Yahweh Dios Ma'at Jah
Rastafari fyah dance, sex, music, hip-hop

It's bigger than religion
Hip-hop
It's bigger than my nigga
Hip-hop
It's bigger than the government
This one is the healer, hip-hop

[Verse Erykah Badu]
Told you we ain't dead yet
We been livin' through your internet
You don't have to believe everything you think
We've been programmed wake up, we miss you
They call you indigo, we call you Africa
Go get baptized in the ocean of the people
Say reboot, refresh, restart
Fresh page, new day, O.G.'s, new key...
