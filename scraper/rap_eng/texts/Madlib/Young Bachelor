Young bachelor
Trynna get lucky witcha numbers just like a raffler
Not really into women with gin inside of the plastic cup
But in the night I'm smooth like Dracula, love the way you back it up
I dropped all my side joants this is the catch up
I put that on bread, dollars, throw it and make em holler
Keep the leash around ya collars homie just like rockweilers
Yea I got the bark on me, uh
I do mean green, but lemme calm down cause the ZAVAGE ain't that mean
After the split up, I lost half of me like no preen up
So Michael put me up with a Latina during d lunch
Body was fine, with hips like magic
Ain't need to pull out a rabbit to perform some tricks
But in the end thats when they see I ain't got game like that
Yet my dm's steady filling up with thirst traps
In person with the ladies I'm all awkward and such
Cuz I see it in they eyes that they don't care that much
This is coming from a place that hands can't touch
Don't rely on women they'll leave you hanging like Klu klux

[Hook2x]
Baby why'd you have to go-oh-ohh
Baby why'd you have to go-oh-ohh

[Verse 2]
She's sick of a hypocrite, said she can't get with this
Said I should be dropping dimes at the flick of the wrist
Whip it flip it mix it trick it and then i hit it forget it
That's the flow we give these women without even considering emotion, but that isn't my devotion
Baby girl you should know I got my own plans in motion
Talking about getting beated and mistreated
So you got mad I tried to holler for what reason?
On every broken heart is a hate made band aid
And then they wonder why a brotha never show love
Cuz love that ends always feels like slugs
Don't brag about the things I can do, i just keep it inside
Just waiting til it's perfect like diamonds that don't shine
Overtime I met a girl a couple months later
Whole room new she was bad so I tried to investigate her
She gave me that look from a distance
The way that her hair flips have you singing like Neyo, miss independent
Looking so gifted , put it on Ya wish list, just like Christmas but slow it down
She said we having fun boo why you ditching
I said I'm heart broke girl, can't you see the stitches

[Hook]

This last verse was too hard to really jot down
Cuz I'm on top now back in the spot now
So i had to slow it down and play it loud to the crowd yo
But that ain't true , only reason I stepped in the booth was cuz of you
We split like ends and tore from the root & they heard that
Through the grapevine together we grew
And the saddest thing to admit to, we grew apart too
Like we tried to make a sequel but our star ain't come through
That's why I used to call you my cinema
My favorite movie but I never had to sneak into her
I remember one night, I prayed that God would take the pain out her life
And it never occurred to me before, but maybe that's the reason we don't speak no more
So I swallowed my tears my anger and my pride
Cuz I still get hooked when I look in her eyes
Now I see all the women of different colors
And deep down I still love ya, but now I'm just another
