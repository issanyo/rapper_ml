[Heems]
This is some technique rap
It could be some stoner rap

Tried it a party and it was my thing
Paranoid, self-consciousness is my thing
Greedheads and weed heads
Self-anointed street cred
Emaciated fools look at us and know that we fed
Weed edge
It ain't a hobby, dude, it's a lifestyle
Rap songs about weed, yo that's type-wild

Goo so green, it look like Nickelodeon Gak
I'm in a Cineplex Odeon burning in the back
Listening to Burning Spear
Taking trips to Burning Man
Told my dude I'd call him back when I'm done with burning, man
Burnt after reading the script for Burn After Reading
You say it's addictive, I say that's misleading
Lampin the basement, lamps for cross-breeding
Got a day job, I'll dirt, water, and feed them

Afgooey? My uncle's an Afghan
Light-skinned Hindu, dude, a real man's man
Yeah he grow that gan-gan
Right next to the poppies
Papi, I caught a whiff quick and tried to cop me
Uncloneable shit, that mean you can't copy
Then I broke bread, ate my lamb mad sloppily
Eyes slanted cuz of Afghan goo
Afghan Goo for Himanshu
Afgooey
Oowee oowee oowee
Oowee oowee oowee
Oowee oowee oowee oowee

[Kool AD]
Afgooey
Oowee oowee oowee
Was finna go out then I watched two movies
Now I'm... feelin pretty groovy
Probably finna get a snack like Scooby
Woooowww
This is silly dumb shit
Was it really one hit?
Now my mouth drier than a nun's tit
Aw duggunit
Those two zooted motherfuckers gone done it
Afgooey
Oowee oowee owee
Sticky icky icky
Vicky Vicky Vicky
V-A-Z-Q-U-E-Z, believe me
I make these stupid ass raps look easy
Yeahhhh
Weed marijuana cannabis pot
I like to smoke pot
Cheeba weed
Oh wait, I already said weed
Shoutout to my girl Marisol, she love weed

Heh

Alright see you guys laaater

[Kool AD & pitch-shifted voice]
