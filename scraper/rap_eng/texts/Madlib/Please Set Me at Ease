[Verse 1]
I'm in a maze cuz' I ain't seen you in a long time
Chocolate skin, thick thighs, innocent eyes
You used to be mines with no commitment
You stay committed hate to laugh but then I took you through it
I still admit it but your shape developed lookin' tighter than ever
We used to roll with [?] smoking blunts for escaping our issues
Remember when I first tried to hit it you held back
Now you shirking cuz' you is flirting you was all that
My rap finally cracked surface the wait was worth it
After I hit it knew I was [????]
Sex secrets never hit the streets [????] to spoil me
You was doing things in the sexiest ways I'm still amazed that you had my back to this day
For the way now I got you
Through the fire and rain pleasure and pain
Through the riches losses and gains
Whether wife or misses we stay
Cuz we fitted and with it and I ain't' hit it in a long time
So imma' hit it for a long time
Alize or Hennessy you never [??]
To smoke weed and make money that's my kind

[Sample: Bobbi Humphrey]
Oh please, won't you put me at ease?
I try inside, my feelings to hide
How will I know this is real
