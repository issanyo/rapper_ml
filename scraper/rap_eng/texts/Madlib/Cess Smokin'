I make incisions on your wrist with a glass blade, the scent of aftershave
I had to ask Blade to slay vampires
I'm a day-walker, slay all the fakes, oughta
Play ball and stay farther, hey poppa, James callin' ya
Flip the page, I'm the novel's author
I'm the father for the larger chapter, capturin' the fallen matches
That I use to create the flame
The brain's resignated frame blames all the same convicts
Who option to slaughter James life for the price
And the cost of a diamond, bloodier than hymens
Spanish name Jaime, higher than Khalifa
Walkin' down a dark hallway and cathedral
Prayin' in the church, slayin' demons for the fun of it
The son of God wonderin', the devil and his minions
Listenin', pissin' away his Beloved's angels and humans
The fate is so crucial, playing this game and staying so mutual
I wonder why exactly rappers claim to aim straight
For the galaxy to reach pleasure, they a fallacy
Pull reasoning, assault reachin' in
Dull leadership, you fool, play pool if you leanin' in
The whole strike, pool ball, straight for the left corner
Chest morphin', blessed often, mess causin', cess smokin'
Take three hits and pass it on
Face-off, fuck it, get it high and play baseball
Lungs explodin', blunts is tokin', 'nuff of showin' guns from totin'
Fun is open!
To any nigga who wanna smoke and chill, literal
I get rid of imbeciles for the thrill of it
You cockroaches stop showin' off chopped focus
Rather hang with my brothers that be pot smokers
Ain't a damn thang happenin' when professor high as a teacher
It's my duty to address assignments, preacher
