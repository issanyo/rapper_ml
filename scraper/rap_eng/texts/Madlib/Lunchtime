Yes, we bout to take it back to highschool
Being on the nice tabletops, bishop and nice food
Cooler than I sip a nice classic or when I play pool
Domino fat scraps blowing up like fatty coop
Sipping out broken, ain't no picture playing violin
Higher man, something that I spit like a fireman
I am what I am, like popeye innovecent
Man hot damn, you're not flier higher than
Yours truly, unruly, can't move me
You moolie, you stooly
I'll kidnap your cutie, take her back
To my flat and make a porno movie
Bust a nut on her back and let it trickle down her booty
Like nuts and shoes, sluts gonna choose
That pimp with a limp in them crispy white shoes
Airforce, full force, that's what I'm about
So don't try to kid playboy, get knocked the fuck out

It's lunch time, beat on the tables
We don't have to rewind
Smashing us tickets then we're cut in the line
Before time is up, put down your books
And bust your rhyme

It's lunch time, beat on the tables
We don't have to rewind
Smashing us tickets then we're cut in the line
Before time is up, put down your books
And bust your rhyme

I'm definitely in the house, you know?
Most definitely, I flow slow so effortlessly
I'm so low, but who know go second like me
My whole record is gree, I'm on record indeed
The whole west is with me nigga
What you mean, like you ain't fucking with o consecutive street
Go and collect you degree, I'm throwing records for G's
A hundred G's I breathe for 40 seconds and leave
Yeah, I'm hit to backburn game
That's why I play the corner like path certain, yeah
Bishop Lamont in war in G, war with me
Niggas get caught, the shit that you drop is boring me
I figured you flop, the minute the plot
Is finished, I pin it and stop
Off the rocks, unorthodox, until the coffin locks
Yeah, often job for the love
Because I ain't off the block

It's lunch time, beat on the tables
We don't have to rewind
Smashing us tickets then we're cut in the line
Before time is up, put down your books
And bust your rhyme

It's lunch time, beat on the tables
We don't have to rewind
Smashing us tickets then we're cut in the line
Before time is up, put down your books
And bust your rhyme
