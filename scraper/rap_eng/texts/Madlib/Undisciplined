Undisciplined kids don't cut it
You gotta stay focused y'all niggas don't cut it
Undisciplined kids don't cut it
You gotta stay focused y'all niggas are hopeless

[God's Gift]
Yo
You can't control your own soul so how you gonna roll against what god sent
I tip off rappers in honesty
The irony is
Harassing me is blasphemy
How you get the god a challenge when you off balance physically and spiritually
I raise above the clouds in a hurry
But if you want me
I'll just kick you down earthly
Now mostly I flows ufo styles cause the universe is our trial
But I'm versital
I can't correct your style deflects the fect you rejects
Might holt your freedom is my right to be righteous
Not toxicated
By toxic toxins I tox the skin
With pure chase intentions

[well who you be yo]

The rest oppress bills stress in the blood
The fresh in the flesh is gods gift unplugged
The slaughter kids immoderate
When I'm on the microphone you stop, look, and learn so you gets the most out of it
Direct from area fifty one
Stomps on more techniques
I freak the Madlib beats
Wack styles get destroyed so you best believe when I rush MC's they can't avoid
When I bust that asteroid

[Wildchild]
So you're a gangsta cool but on the mic yo what's the difference
Off the top can you drop rhythmatic metaphorical flows for instance
Naw I didn't think so
You're just like all the floppy sloppy who like to kick back and copy
Like you were Kinko's
Sampling zap tracks
Only reason why the crowd claps
Covers up the fact your raps whack
So I chill
Wondering when the miracle will
Bring it to your senses mentally and
Physically bring out your lyrical skill
Ha
This common sense sell out ish
You be devoted
How it turned into a hit I don't know
Why it gets promoted is where the concern lies
And visine clears my eyes
So if you ever leave the country I suggest return wise
Ha
In hip hop we don't stop to rock a joint
So we point out whack emcees so rap audience sees my point
Not the baddest nigga
I never smoke but had a swigga
I'm the thinnest one with lyrics that have the fattest figure
Ha

Undisciplined kids don't cut it
You gotta stay focused y'all niggas don't cut it
Undisciplined kids don't cut it
You gotta stay focused y'all niggas are hopeless

Undisciplined kids don't cut it
You gotta stay focused y'all niggas don't cut it
Undisciplined kids don't cut it
You gotta stay focused y'all niggas are hopeless
