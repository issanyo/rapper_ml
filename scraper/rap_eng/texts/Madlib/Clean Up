[Intro]:
Now this is the real thing. We found a groove. Ha. We move each other

[Verse One: Saukrates]:
I don't wanna leave you on the sidelines dude
The clock is ticking get your mind right dude
Rememberin' the days when I was like you
Why I ain't end up in the pine box? True
What goes up, must come down
So when you sittin' at the top, you won one round
Now here comes one generation that's so profound
You ain't never heard the word "assassination" so pronounced
Like ?? through the repercussion of winnin' while you sinnin'
The nation stay huntin' for you

[Hook: Saukrates]
And I don't mean to break the news to you niggas
But the crabs in the buckets are true
As true as a bullet, easy as a trigger pull it
I'm sure you'll do what's best for you
So clean up, don't ease up
I know you'll do what's best for you

[Verse Two: Black Thought]
The conflict is crucial
The drama is just futile
Hush
Kinda make you wanna wonder what to do you know it must
Get a little easier on some ooh child trust
People cut throat this is the new style
I know you're man just passed but this too shall
Just keep those crabs out of where you lay your roots down
They in the bucket tryin' to make they splash
And take more each figure, fuck it they gon' take they cash
Cause it's like, I gotta get it, gots gots to get it
Especially in a city where cops not permitted
So box lock your digits
I hate to be the one to break the news to you but shit's hot
Watch them niggas
A few is gonna flat out, walk up and say "fuck you"
Others is gonna play it like, "Aye, what you been up to?"
Knowing they want to get somebody to touch you
I know regardless you gon' do what you must do
For you

[Hook]

[Outro]
Me? I ain't high. You know why? Cause I can't truly be high unless all my motherfuckin' friends is high. I look around. I see my friends. Do you know what I feel like doing? (What you feel like doing?) I feel like sharing my shit
