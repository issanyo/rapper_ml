[verse 1: Napoleon Da Legend]
Incorrect intellect on Internet spread
Political threats when you speak the truth to heads
Losing respect for these rooster head cats who mislead
All the masses into thinking it was cool to beg
It’s lies to me I’m only civilized to a degree
The sodomist philosophy won’t agree with the god in me
Solomon breed turn to bottom feeders inside of gotham fiending
For a pot to piss in the clock’s ticking hard to be so optimistic
Positive thinking is key symphonies come in epiphanies
We don’t want no sympathy
If you live to see passed 25 you a god
Cause the odds are against that hard for them to defend that
If power was a guitar then who’s pulling the strings black?
From PE to X-Clan I’m bringing that thing back
We selling drugs on the same streets they used to lynch at
Freedom lies beyond where the fence at remember that

[hook x4: Napoleon Da Legend]
Freedom is in the mind

[verse 2: Napoleon Da Legend]
Me and the queen at the door Cuba Afena Shakur
Mahogany scenery playing like I seen it before
Speak for the poor throughout the years you seen me mature
‘f I didn’t learn from my mistakes I would repeat em for sure
2 pennies a thought great bars worth millis and more
Riding till the wheels fall and my Achilles is torn
The city’s yours feeling like Iverson before the draft
Everybody saw the potential way before came the cash
Plate of sweet potato mash say grace then we laugh
Sacrificed my life for this you can say I’m a sado-mas
Socrates and Plato math I played the back and studied
Don’t sleep on this humility pay me in cash money
Hit the pavement in Beijing we don’t play with these things
My name rings taking selfies in Dubai on skate rinks
See my name on the Sphinx moving cake like Brinks
Sometimes I stop and meditate on how great and blessed my life is

[Verse 3: Napoleon Da Legend]
Had to stop playing roles resistance’ll take a toll
Or let the wind take control of my bare naked soul
Gliding like the fingers of Curtis Mayfield on the instrument
And stretch my vision further than just getting the Benjamins
Its cleansing and quite pleasant a glimpse of heaven cause
Peace inside the mind is where you find the essence
Where you find answers to all your questions
Erasing doubts you can see the devilish energy and chase it out
Vice breeds inside the psyche twice the light speed
I rather live my life then dream of how it might be
Keeping my third eye open on this earth I’m free
Got joints on my phone that’s so hot it’ll burn through my jeans
I never spit kid these words I bleed from deep within
Was born a quite introverted child I used to keep it in
But music helped me break the shackles and made it natural
Cause when it catch you ain’t nothing like it
