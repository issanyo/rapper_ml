Roll another tryin' to get blown
Feelin' high like I'm tryin' to leave the ozone
Whole zone FYI to the dome
When I die, you can scrape resin from the bones and get high
Optimos, hashish, Alamo, roll swole
Stay towed on the Cali-grown
In the back room all alone
My girl thinks I stay high 'cuz she keep me bored
Maybe, or, just an addict to the Purp Passion
Or a fiend to the OG
Like a hype for the all-White, Widow and the Lights
Crystal got the buds lookin' like Frostbites
Make sure you break it down right
And reroll if a rookie got it too tight
Used to fuck up my high when I passed the law
Until I got myself a medical card

Who got the blunt, let me hit it
Mary Jane
Mary Jane
Got the joint
Mary Jane
Bloodshot 'cuz I'm smokin' on some bomb-ass trees

Green, white, orange
Blue, purple, black
Red strands of that 'dro
Heavy tote bag
Shit I'm on the street, one over where the weed store at
Cheaper than your baby dad's sack
Smoke with the homie
Roll these Dutches
Sent home with no panties to a man with the munchies
Luckily he was too high to care
Dinner still at 8 and the ho paid the bills on time
Man I swear I get so high, that I might forget this line
Lime Kush got me over hard times, tryin'
Didn't have a dime's worth, when you ain't high
Even 9 to 5 lot better when you wish you was vacating on the pleasure trip
Used to mess up my high when I passed the law
Now I got myself a medical card

Mary Jane
Light it up, roll it, pass it around
Mary Jane
Got the joint

When he go to the studio, she's there waitin' for him
When he's writin', she's next to him
