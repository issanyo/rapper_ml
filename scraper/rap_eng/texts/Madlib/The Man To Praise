[Verse 1]
In 19, seventy-nine, the rhyme for fun hoping to become a celebrity
Rap star, some said I stink cause they didn’t think that I would go that far
10 years old al I wanted was to get on it at a jam and damn man you fronted
Plenty times, many times still with throw jams, when I finally got it, I was not into slow jams
When I got you hyped as I drop the mic, want to rhyme every next time but not tonight
So I wrote extra hard, the crowd got into me because mentally I left you scarred
The same suckers that used to rock in front of “Used to jocking” wanted me to get loose a lot
They used to come around town down my sound
Compound round like a clown now they standing astound
A lot of rubbish, rappers where getting on, wax while I still rap the cause I was sitting on
I felt like everybody was running outside playing me, saying “P yo when you coming out”
Got to run around some people would tell me things like
I can make you big but all they did was sell me dreams
Then I met my man the almighty K.G. him and me real chill and still tidy
I got down with D-Nique the hypnotic, performing on a stage with a mic he’s psychotic
I always wanted to perform with a bird’s eye view of people who come and see you like at the LQ
I owe a lot of things to Arron D, cause when he got hooked up, the brother looked up me
And D-Nique yes my best friend you can check it we made a record called “Let the homicides begin”
In ’88 the styles we were running down and the music nobody used it but run it now
We gotta, a lotta rep and respect from brothers and sisters those that dissed us could step
All I could say is that hard work pays, now the rhyme inspector MC Percee P’s the man to praise

[Verse 2]
In’89 Ekim got down, when I stepped to him I knew him way back since junior high
Where he rest, he lived up in Jackson, me and D lived up in Patterson in case you’re asking
In the boogie down, uptown suit up clowns that fucked ‘round got bucked down
You left running out the castle that was the spot you got a lot of hassle coming out
Young ladies weren’t on my lap until we came up and got our names up on the map
For every hottie, jocked at me at every party, I wasn’t bags never thinking but sticking everybody
Every Thursday, it was E in the booth getting loose cutting with Kid Capri, no discussion
Busting my chops to get my props and rock and stop at the tip top of hip hop
Now they wanna see me, some thought I was under but now they wonder, how it feels to be me
They gotta go, gotta go why, they wasn’t with me before a shorty come get me when I got a show
All I could say is that hard work pays, now the rhyme inspector MC Percee P’s the man to praise
