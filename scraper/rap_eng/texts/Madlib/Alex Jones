[Verse 1]
Alex Jones,
Yeah I'm goin' nuts for standin', cold
Yeah I'm Bruce Banner, mixed with Shan and Combs,
I am coming for the spot and I will stand alone
And ain't noone gon' stop me nigga, I'm plantin' poems
Then I watch 'em grow, bring me the fame
Yeah I rock the house and leave the stage in flames
I burn down the game then I come back save it
I'm like a necromancer spittin' this depraved shit
Then commit necrophilia, Hip-hop is dead and gone, from long, but damn, she shoulda shaved it
Made it easier for me to bust but fuck it
There's a hole, there's a hole, there's a hole in your bucket
Comin' back a kingpin like I was Noriega
I never liked em, but damn, why you niggas such haters?
I'm tryna get on tryna take over the games
And these niggas on the sideline jeering 'cuz they lame
I might as well shit on 'em like I was Kobe-Shaq
And there I'm gone and I ain't never ever comin' back
I'm outta your grasp, no skinny, no fat
Tit for tat, like that, pick pack, and I'm piercing the Peking order
With they dick in one hand like it was a penny porno
Sticking up the rap bank like I was a wrecking baller

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

I'm breaking down the dam, like damn, he's an ape beast
Don't fuck with the pictures, I don't fuck with a say cheese
Always bust off on the beat, never fuck with the safety
But that's just me, tryna guarantee an offspring
Bust a nut, never call, I'm guaranteeing Kong's King
When I come through
I'm bout to take it over and I got an heir
And why you lookin' that way 'cuz the king is here
Leave trails of Sour D, soaked in LSD
So when you light it up, you just fell in deep
And the game got in you in its clutches, like Ray Allen,
I'm never fallin' six feet deep, the way Nas is
But I built up my own road
Never need another's help, 'cuz I got my own
Grew up by myself, yet was not alone
'Cuz I got my family and I got my home
Yeah I got my crew with me, hittin' spliffs to the dome
Right here gettin' lifted, kick back and spit poems
Killin' the track, read R.I.P, Sherlock Holmes
Airborne rockin' Jordans on my phone
And then I rock the rim like Shaq or Dwight Howard
Dunk it down nuts in your face I ain't no coward
Bring it down glass showers
Sit back smirkin' in yo face like Bowser
