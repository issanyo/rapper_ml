Fuckin' sick, what are you gonna do about it

[Verse 1]

Okie dokie. Madchild relocate, smash phone and rotate
Stab with a dull blade
Love gone quick like flash bamboo
First thought if I see him imma smash that goof but, try to be wiser, try to surprise her, try to devise a new plan
Can't be won, Mad can't be done must be champion
Light at end of tunnel but I can't see none
King Kong, black gucci belt and a gold blazer. Valium, hot bubble bath and a cold razor
God drops off gift right in front of me. First night out meet girl shine stunningly. I quite cunningly grip this honey bee
Come back suddenly, be funny, she's money. Feels like she's talking to a serpent, work it. I can feel the nervousness
Thanks she's a perfect gift
I'm fly like Hancock, I'm Bangkok dangerous
Bang
From Van to Los Angeles
Half Asian, small blonde and green eyes
Thank god she feel real nice
