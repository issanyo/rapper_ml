[Sample]
But now we can't sit up where they go
Yeah that's what I'm saying
So we come to find out the real deal right about now
If y'all can get hip to it or if y'all heard it before
We want yall to get down
Get a little soul clap with us or something
And I want everybody in the place -
If y'all know the words to the record let me bring it
If y'all know the words to the record just sing along alright

[Instrumental]

Deadly combination, boy
