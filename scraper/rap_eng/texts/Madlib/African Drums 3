Napoleon Da Legend [verse 1]

Before Palpatine colonized the continent
Raped and try to mentally sodomized our dominance
Steal from the land and kill children women and man
Imposed religion turned our homes to concentration camps
Now it’s more weapons tribal factions
Violent practices rivals wanna get it cracking
Before slavery made us distant cousins
And Got us dissing our brothers like in living color
Dirty dozens following trends like a herd of mouton
Judge Dred serving us justice is the repercussion
Facts tho they want our black gold to stack dough
They stole our Afros injections in there butt to make they ass grow
Changed our borders turn around take our resources
Then come back with some fake ass peace offering
Camouflaged in the mangroves this is a guerrilla war
Eating off the land where the plants grow

This the rhythm of the African Drums
Red black and green flag waiving at sun
In the cities the villages jungles and the slum
No matter where you at still rep where you from
It goes
Fela Kuti, Patrice Lumumba, Nelson Mandela
Papa Wemba, Zao, Salif Keita, Angelique Kidjo, Digbeu
Gohou, Alpha Blondie, Tyken Jah Fakoli
Hannibal Barca, Chinua Achebe, Biko
Zulu And Tutu, Marcus Garvey
Thomas Sankara, Toussaint, Marley

Napoleon Da Legend [verse 2]

Cassava leaves in Brazzaville where we shop and chill
In Ghana we build where else u get that kind of feel?
Plus the melanin is excellent color tones
Is subtle poems ya mothers cooking got u running home
Rhythmatic posture with cinematic shakras
Go to Ethiopia the traffic there’ll shock ya
Drum beats inventors of the baseline runs deep
Make you see the unseen power from the sun beams beaming
With knowledge like the Dogon tribe
Same mystique energy that makes Gohan fly
Masai Warriors and Haile Selassie carry the god seed
And breaking out of the cycle we living now free free free
Botswana
Small time little league playa pop warna
African investments Akon electric
WiFi connections with a beautiful complexion
