[Intro]
"Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men... just want to watch the world burn."

[Verse 1]
My drivel droppin from moons so -
An open minded nigga got brains that could stretch out to Pluto
Holdin' it down tight like gravity on a sumo
Wrestle with my spit comin through the atmosphere Hot with the flavor
Fasten ya seat-belt for the savior
Let the wickedness fascinate ya
Its courtesy of the Madliberator, the mass innovator
My skills implement Daoism in Vader
These wack cats needa to know my art is sharper than dao
So let the crowd rejoice, it's Bin Laden's assassinator
High off life its the master of Zen, I'm breathin inscents of nature
Haas spitta put imprints on ya brain, then describe the ultimatum like a cat scan
Live vicariously through myself a constant victim of backstab
Tryna fathom the flow is like Jimi Neutron failin math class
My mind moves dimensions so, I speak telepathy with Aslan
With no wardrobe, shorten the bridge infinitely
The rhythm and wake you and wake ya from ya sleep like the Syrian infantry
Ahead of my time directin symphonies since infancy

[Bridge]
The power comes in response to a need, not a desire
You have to create that need

[Verse 2]
Got the power to bring superman in-jury
Just so he can judge villainy gingerly
My verbal skill will bring the world in perfect symmetry
That's a metaphor only for those mentally lifted over societies limits
That's why my wisdom is so elderly developed old women help ME cross the street
I bring the ruckus like Raekwon leadin Mujahideen
Can't stop the reign amazing the damage my slobber leave
For these non-believers spittin fire, but
Maybe I should, reflect before this caustic leap
I'm bout to set it off, Muhammad Bouazizi
I feel the flame within me but they fanning it out
Like Denzel and Dakota need me to cover up, my impurities
So, don't be mad when I spit graffiti
Shout out to the beat konducta
The cheap production will make ya stream it through ya system like aqueducts or arteries
Novicies overshadowed by dominance better bob and weave
Emcees just get out the way like Lebron through the lane
I'm taking charge protect your novelties
Haas spitta let the novel breathe...
