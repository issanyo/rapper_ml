(Verse 1)
This the quest of the best destined in question
If I don't rock a vest
Guess we testing the resurrection
In my profession spect' nothing less than perfection
If you been requesting death
Then get set for the next election
Who would've guessed that my head be a deadly weapon
Contesting any contestant directing the whole direction
In your section or street
You'll find me flexing a beat
With Nike checks or something fresh on my feet
I don't check the receipt
I just pay it and hope
Whoever waiting is broke
And my tip can go get a coat
We the realest and illest
You feel this every note
Ain't got no ceilings
No feelings
My heart is colder than snow
First you fake it then make it
That's just the way that it go
We just get faded all day and then get on stage for a show
Yeah I'll pay for the homie
But I don't pay for the hoe
Cause when you fuck me over I know I'll be saving dough
And I hope you know I don't need it
Flow is over conceded
Mistreat a beat a stomp the shit into the street
When I'm heated
This MP3 get repeated
I'm undefeated
So if you don't fucking like it
Then beat it
I'm gone

(Verse 2)
I live in the future
But dream in the past
I'm not a chronic abuser
But a fiend for that grass
Little lean in my glass
Keep my breathing relaxed
You can keep achieving first
I'll keep sneaking in last
But winning is all in your head
Something a winner said
And legends never die
Another lie you been fed
Cause you're all alone when you're dead
And they promise to remember you
But trust me eventually they forget
Type of shit that make me break a sweat
When I try to pay my debts
Or try to make it less
And I can't take the stress
Of knowing that I might not be a great success
Knowing I ain't the best
Need to get this weight off my chest
In a way some say I been blessed
I would say you got it backwards
Amount of time that I practiced
And still refining my tactics
Seizing my passions
Even with Jesus's absence
I'm not facetious
Just eager to see the next thing that happens
I'm not expecting the fame
Just put respect on my name
But don't step in my lane
Unless you prepped with flame
I came set with the same
You gonna have to refrain
From spitting weak shit in vein
Team been seasoned and trained
To kill mc's in these game
And if we compete off the brain
You'll be fucking leaving in shame
But that's only one of my feats
Even my beats are insane
And if my CD is acclaimed
Then only me is to blame
