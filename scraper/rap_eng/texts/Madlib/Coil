[Verse]
Lee rake the money like leaves
Proceed to rip spleens, distressed like rip jeans
Most you niggas rhymes devoid
I'll knock you out your cordouroys
You thought you was a kingpin
I'll show you that you a corner boy
Blockbuster, hotter than fumes from hot ovens
My chicken is pot stuffing
You niggas are not nothing
If i give you piece of mind
You'll never have peace my guy
If this beat is a pizza pie
You'll never have a piece of mines
Stop it, your microscopic
Your whole vision myopic
Infringing on my hot shit
Stop it with the nonsense
Get your block hit
Without me using a mockten
Stop him he eating up
Cool him down he heating
Im kirby with the rap shit
Im never gonna eat enough
With your ho i put out my meat and stuff
And she eat up
Pussy so right, that i never get to skeet enough
Dick hit her sternum
I asked her if its deep enough
Like a can of red vegetables
You know i beat it up
Like most rappers these days
You know she proceeds to suck
My flows crack craniums
Attack atriums
Collapse stadiums
And forces all money out of an ATM
If thats alien, i know how to be human
Im always schooling the students
Im always teaching the teachers
She sucking me in the bleachers
Now you crying to a preacher
And your whole life is in ruins
Flow potent like i move bricks
Stay coming with that new shit
Im making bloody yogurt with ya nougat
Stop moving
You can never face me cause you ass
Move quick and fast
Lee get the cash
