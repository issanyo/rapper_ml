Ok I'm not playing any more music for anybody
And that includes myself
Until somebody calls
And pledges some money so that our station does not have to go off the air
I mean why should I bother to play records for you
If you're not even willing to call to pledge a couple of
A couple of dollars
A couple of dollars, its not that much money
We've been playing what you want
But we have to have your money
We can't make it without you
We played uh Margot Hemminway's new album
We debuted it, premiered it on this station
Uh we're the only station in the whole Tri-State area
To play the Phish (?)
The whole, all the way through
We play a lot of old stuff
We play a lot of Cher's stuff before she sold out
We play a lot of crap
Bu-but that's what you want you know

[Sample]
Hey the man's clothes
You're standing tall just like a tree
But a tree can't think
A tree can't see
Like you and me
It just stands tall, that's all

Uh oh
You got me wrong
Uh oh
Uh oh
It won't be long
Uh oh
For you to see
That you and me
And him make three
And we're just branches on a tree
Hey

[DJ]
And we, we sponsor a lot of public service stuff man
We had a show on Saturday nights
We had a whole series on how to beat phantom America
A lot of people you know, want us to repeat it, you know
We're getting a lot of heat from the government
We're still gonna repeat it you know
The management says go ahead and repeat it
So we're gonna be able to play it for you people again
