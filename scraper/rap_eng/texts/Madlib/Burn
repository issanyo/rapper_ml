Intro :
One love

Verse 1 :
Jokerly laughter with an S to all these rappers
Watch the money burn
Hundred years they tried to search
The black bandana, sandals, katana
The master of four elements
Flow, words, and wit
Without, speech impediment
All jets limited The Fist of Legends starring Jetlagg
(cough)
Jet-Li
Famous for breaking the Atari
He stand stills at walls during war
Nickname Banksy
Let it spray
Kings died to keep him alive
The true heir no one can grasp
An abstract power
He lifts Thor's hammer
No time for ceremony
I'm skinning these cats alive
That time of year, It's taxidermy
Words ain't worthy
Influenced I'm Kirby
So unpredictable the flow curvy
Release early
The flow Curry
The flow Curry
Man

Verse 2:
Overzelous rapping while tearing clover leaf petals
Never found love except for one, that's hiphop
Center bound touch of a mic, I feel like Zev Love
Exes still got me fucked up
Been years ever since I trusted one
First rapper in my country bout to win grammies
I'm Kool Moe Dee
Fuck the companies who banned Blue Pepsi
That was the shit
That was the shit

Chorus :
Why they gotta take away all the good things
All the good things
I guess the best people leave this earth first
While we too busy crawling from the dirt
Better move on no time to mourn let's just see the world burn 2x
