[Intro]
Go to the next shit

Now you don’t have to listen no goddamn more cause I’ll tell ya the answers

[Verse I: Stacy Epps]
I made so many moves
From the day to day, it’s so true
On the rise, so I can’t keep blue
Or revenge get a snack or two
Telling you I got to make it through
Having [?] just to use
So, feet and heavy hands on my toes
Three days ampel nights without moons
Can’t lose me, so I can meet you
There’s only one way and I got to prove to me not to you

The way that I live my life, I cannot apologize
The way I live my life, can’t compromise
Got to do what is right
The way that I live my life, I cannot apologize
The way I live my life, can’t compromise
Got to do what is right

[Chorus: Stacy Epps]
The way of life
The way that I live my life, wooah
The way of life
The way that I live my life, wooah
The way of life
The way that I live my life, wooah
You don’t know
The way of life
The way that I live my life, wooah
The way of life
The way that I live my life, wooah
The way of life
The way that I live my life, wooah
You don’t know

You don’t know the way I live my life

[Verse II: Stacy Epps]
So many places I’ve seen
Almost like every day is a dream
Full of glee days with some peeps
Some are there for my hands to free
Soft winds comferting swift breeze
Flowing through my hair as I sing
Lullaby’s to float with me
On this long and winding journey
Now past a brown stone with things
I look back, I’m so thought broken with you and with me

The way that I live my life, I cannot apologize
The way I live my life, can’t compromise
Got to do what is right
The way that I live my life, Icannot apologize
The way I live my life, can’t compromise
Got to do what is right

[Chorus: Stacy Epps]
The way of life
The way that I live my life, wooah
The way of life
The way that I live my life, wooah
The way of life
The way that I live my life, wooah
You don’t know
The way of life
The way that I live my life, wooah
The way of life
The way that I live my life, wooah
The way of life
The way that I live my life, wooah
You don’t know

[Outro: Declaime]
Y’all should be dead, unless we all shed
Those demonic lowlife spirits
It’s time for us to kill it, last days can’t you feel it
Not even faith healers can heal it, a Madlib Inzavion
And I’m a madman, crate digger station
You demons forced this man’s hand, don’t make me grab you
Take this how you have to, or don’t take it at all
Our time is growing small, the writings on the wall
Take this how you have to, or don’t take it at all
Our time is growing small, the writings on the wall
Take this how you have to, or don’t take it at all

Take this how you have to, or don’t take it at all
Our time is growing small, the writings on the wall
Take this how you have to, or don’t take it at all
Our time is growing small, the writings on the wall
