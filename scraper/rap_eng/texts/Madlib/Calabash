[Intro]
Oya
Calabash
Iwa o

[Verse I]
Calabash
Don't envy water jug
Machete
Don't envy butter knife
Sand don't envy the rainforest soil
And an oak tree
Don't envy cedar tree
So why do we kill each other
When we're all the same (5x)

[Verse II]
Calabash
Don't envy water jug
And a bowl of fruit
Don't envy calabash
And a rainforest soil
Don't envy sand
So why do we kill each other
When we're all the same (3x)
Cause we're all the same
Git dat through yuh brain
