[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
I've been doing this for so long
Like the only thing I know
Feels like the only thing I know(I know, I know, I know)
I never really thought what I did was so wrong..
But my eyes were closed, look at how I got to grow(to grow, to grow)
There's things in my life, that I gotta undue
What I thought was so right, now I gotta untrue(true..)
But we spoke everyday now we don't even speak at all(speak at all)
Cause I brought you so much pain that you won't pick up my call

[Hook: Andy Mineo & Sheena Lee]
And it's so bittersweet
How the one that can love you so much and hurt you so deep
Light up your day to mess up your whole week
Lock your heart down and keep the key, it goes..
I-don't-want - for you to be my next episode
I-don't-want - just another love story told
I-just-want - you to be my sister
I see life so much different
Now that I know what you're worth...

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
In my quest for them X and O's, in my quest-in my quest for them X and O's
Wasn't being intentional
Now I gotta big list of some ex's, oh..
Do I regret those? well yes and no
Through it all though I got to grow
But it came with a friendship broke
Was it really all worth it? I'm feeling all serpent
That Lecrae line did work when I heard it
2 bars hit hard like a 2 part sermon
"Like Christ, love your wife how He loves the church
Without seeing how many hearts you can break first"
I was making relationships
A temporary fix to medicate my loneliness
Taking doses, of emotions
Via phone call, when we spoke and
I planted seeds I really couldn't see you
Couldn't feed myself so how could I feed you?
Wasn't seeing God so clear how could I see you?
I was just leading you on but didn't need you
Dang, look at the things we do
For our own pleasure we go and use people
You ain't even single no more but I wanna keep you
Look at how it exposed the heart of man is evil

[Hook]

[Outro: Andy Mineo & Sheena Lee]
Now that I know what you're worth yea...
Now that I know, I see life so much different
I see life so much different
Oooh, I see life so much different
Now that I've been forgiven...

[Hook]
