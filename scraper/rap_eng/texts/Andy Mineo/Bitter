[Intro]
You didn't know I was proud of you up there singing, huh?
You don't want your father to see you?
Huh, C-Lite?
Come on, man
You're supposed to call me! What's the matter with you, huh?
You don't like me no more?
You tell Mark you're here, but you don't call your dad
Alright, give your dad a call, bye

[Hook]
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter
So take it all away

[Verse 1]
Anybody know the feeling of rejection?
Feels like you was kicked in your midsection
When you feel like you simply just lost your best friend
Everybody play the game of love, you 'bout to bench and
You start thinking she's chillin' with other men, and you gettin' jealous
Start beefing, and harboring harsh resentment
I'm asking Jesus to keep me from being bitter
Go skeeming on Twitter, get mad and post it on my statuses
Bitterness can make a heart numb, but hope is like a star
You don't see it shine bright until the dark come
So don't just scoop the dust, remove the rug
If I got unforgiveness in my heart
Then there really ain't no room for love
Plus it's stupid cause, I've been so forgiven
That if I hold a grudge, I don't show He's risen,
But I know my sins removed since Jesus came
With no reason to forgive me, but He did, so I do the same

[Break 1]
Sometimes things just happen in life that don't make any sense
But bitterness is a choice

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yea, I gotta tread softly
Don't wanna be a hypocrite
Plus I got some bitterness I wanna get up off me
Where should I start?
Well, I feel like I'd be sorta frontin' to say
When my father calls that I don't hit ignore button
It's probably cause we never kicked it at a younger age
I know when he's calling but I don't have got his number saved
I keep dodging him but I'm just being honest
All he wanna do is talk football and how I should play in college
I get bitter, kinda cold like the winter
It's so hard for me to forgive him then I remember that I'm a sinner
And Jesus forgave me and washed away my sins
When I didn't deserve it then I could forgive him
His power in such amazing love like
When Jesus forgave the ones that pinned him up on that cross
As he was hanging from it
Holy Spirit, teach me to be just like the Son
Remove the roots of bitterness
Don't stop until your work is done

[Break 2]
God I don't wanna be bitter, teach me to forgive
Let me see my own sin

[Hook] (x2)
