[Andy Mineo]
Yeah, he's still alive
He's still breathing
The sun is shining
Yeah, what's the meaning
He shoulda died last night
C-c-c-c-catch someone capped in here
They extra clear
But his vodka was
He had sex in bed and he got that buzz, ah
One day he gonna exit here
And before he go
He gotta find out if there's anything more
Than what he had been living for
We got them

[Co Campbell]
Eyes open
Take a deep breath
Another day I've been kept
Another day I've never seen
Never every vision
Did I ask a lot in my dreams
As I get out that bed
Pull back them blinds
The sun is shinin'
Down on, down on me
I can feel His glory, glory
Shinin' down, down on me

[Hook: Co Campbell]
I, I must be here for a reason
Another day that I'm alive, yeah
There's a reason I'm still breathin', yeah
Another day I survived
So as long as I'm alive
I'mma live the best way
I'mma live my best days
I don't care what the people say
As long as I'm alive
I'mma live the right life
With God on my side
Errything gonna be a'ight
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, ay
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Errything gonna be a'ight
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, ay
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Errything gonna be a'ight

[Co Campbell]
Problems come, problems go
But you'll live to see another day, you'll never know
Tomorrow's not promised, so be grateful when another day is given to you

[Hook]

[Andy Mineo]
Yeah
Che, It's funny how death clarifies life
You lose somebody then gain insight
But bags are light
My heart is heavy
I'm travelling that world saying get ready
Put one in the air if ya ever lost one
Wish ya said goodbye but more time falls done
On that death bed was the most important
Them closed imported, I owe the Lord
Hopin' on before the days out
Countin' days, I make the days count like

[Co Campbell]
Show the people hope
Show the people faith
Give them inspiration on how to live from day to day
