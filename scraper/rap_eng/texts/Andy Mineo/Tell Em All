[Verse 1- S.O.]
Man this is that Christ all in my speech dude
Can’t leave them as they strike off with that evil
Gotta give me what is right tell em its lethal
Sin's sinister delight is simply deceitful so I preach to these people
Scream out from that rooftop where the microphone or that boom box?
No stages, no pages, no wage and that truth rocks
One way but some fools knock but they don’t know of that true rock
They ain't sitting on green pastures, they don’t rest with that true flock
Now they hearing that word rather pioneer on that curb
I am near where they at ain't no fear in that
See them staring at sinful men react
Sneering bearing that curse see them staring glaring at her
Their appearance bearing that burn
They lose their bearings where is that turn
Won’t adhere when will man learn?
The sin that they are chasing, means life’s forever wasted I did that on several cases
Man is so depraved see the way they act
No one else can save so I’m saying that

[Hook- Andy Mineo]
Jesus is the One tell em all please
Never hide the Son brother let them all see
Coz He goin’ be the One that can set us all free
Freedom through the Son that’s what everybody need
Please tell em all – go, go, go (x3)
Please tell em -that the Son about to get it, this the Gospel that I’m spreading ahhhhh

[Verse 2- S.O.]
Uh, I’m spreading a message I know the world needs
It's evil not blessing I see the world fiends
No time for discretion or love what’s called clean
Their sin is progressive and that’s a sure thing (sure thing)
I tell them flee they saying I’m shook
Sow that seed I pray He sees it intercede I’m praying they look
At the One who was lifted death is the sentence granting forgiveness reading that book
I am His witness, filled with His Spirit can’t you see that Christ took
God’s wrath dawg this message that we pass on is God heart towards
Those lost in lust and spark wrong with no God they trust well bar one
It's themselves, its revealed when you see they talk they walk wrong
I’m praying they get broken place their hope in God whose arms long
And its open wide, I’m praying for open eyes
They see their Maker, love their Saviour, know what’s greater grant them open minds
Cuz man is so depraved see the way they act
No one else can save so I’m saying that

[Hook]
