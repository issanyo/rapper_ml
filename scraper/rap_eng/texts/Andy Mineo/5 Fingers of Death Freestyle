[Verse 1]
This is so disrespectful
I'm sorry that I didn't do it sooner
They talkin' that manure
Snakes comin' for my head, that's Medusa
But watch how I maneuver
I ain't fly, man, I'm lunar
I got no time for high opinions with them low commitments
I hear that chatter from a distance, I don't ever listen
Art critics just artists that never made it
So why I care what you sayin', I'm too busy creatin'
I could tell that ya' some crabs, hatin' on the low
Tryna shoot my dream down, why don't you chase your own?
I think I struck a nerve, matter fact I hit a bone
I got a word for them rappers who swear that they on the throne
Oh, so you the king of rap, where your kingdom at?
I got a queen, a fly one sittin' on my lap
You bought the lie them rappers told ya, I bring it back
That's all I gotta say
Roof your ball, I don't wanna play

[Verse 2]
This is so disrespectful
Hip-hop raised me, talkin' back to my parents
Drop that Never Land but, yo, I still haven't landed
Look mama, you don't gotta drop it low if you raisin' standards
Raisin' this banner, mama raised me with manners
Couldn't put me in a box, how I'm raisin' this brand
Hard to stay focused with standin' in front of cameras
But they don't understand it
They don't see that from my vantage
All glory to the Most High, all the praise be
Got them other rappers sweatin' like they need the A.C
It ain't all 'bout who you know cause Bleek knew Jay-Z
If it ain't Sway in the Morning, bad idea tryna play me

[Verse 3]
I know dudes with so much money that it ain't funny
Type of money make you laugh at jokes when it ain't funny
Type of money, go outside lookin' bummy
Still bag a supermodel, they don't care if he ugly
There's politics in this game, but ain't no politicians
And I ain't tryna be another one of fame's victims
Make a name for myself but never make a difference
Now, that's all I gotta say
Roof your ball, I don't wanna play
And this is so disrespectful
Sway, I try to tell 'em right now
Goin' off the top, they know what it is right now
I got it goin', but let me show 'em how I get down

[Verse 4]
Feelin' like the meek shall inherit the earth
Well, that is unless you drop a meek verse
Eek, reverse
Man, I grew up on Nas listenin' to Ether
You gotta come harder than that
And if you don't they put that boy up on a t-shirt
I'm like, listen
Ya gotta come better than that
You know I'm goin' off the hat, you know what's better than that?
What's better than rap?
Other day they dropped Compton
You know that that was Dre day
But right now I'm in the studio, this is Sway day
They goin' nuts over the bars, I'm callin' that Payday
Listen, ya know how we do it
Five fingers of death, you know that that's the crazy music
But two fingers means peace, three means war
If you read between the lines, beef

[Verse 5: Andy & Sway]
You know that's what I'm sayin', but I ain't really messin' with 'em
So my man switched the beat up, I go and catch the rhythm
Any way they wanna do it
Hol' up this is heavenly
Wait a minute, we missin' somebody, where's Heather B?
I don't know where she at though
You know that I don't act slow
I come up off the top and I bring it back though
You know that's how we doin' with the Tracy G
Sway in the Morning, everyday, that's how I get it B
Get it, and I'm heavenly when I represent
You know that's how I get it in everyday and I would go repent
If I end up sinnin' or wylin', they callin' in
They askin' me for some time, I close the door on 'em, dang
Man, why you had to do that?
You know I come through, this is true rap
You throw me a word and I'ma do that
Any way you wanna do it, that's how I'm feelin'
Five fingers of death and the music
Genesis
We talkin' 'bout the Genesis
Yo, ain't no other MC could prolly step to this, mess with this
You know I gotta come through when I represent
Everytime I get it off the top with a dollar spent
That don't make no sense
Revelations
'Bout the Revelation
You givin' me all kinds of books, that's the situation?
Ok, I see you right now
Let me tell you how I get it
Off the top, Sway in the Morning, who don't forget it?
Proverbs
Talkin' 'bout the Proverbs
I'm up in here lookin' like a hot nerd, cause I got the glasses on
And you know that's how I get it, off the top
Cause we way too mornin'
Noah's Ark
And the Noah's Ark
I gotta tell you 'bout this, you know the flow is harsh
I gotta hit 'em off the top, and I'm goin' hard
So get the tickets, Uncomfortable tour
Flow god
And you know that
Corinthians
I'm talkin' 'bout Corinthians
Man, you know a lot more books than you was thinkin' then
Man, I gotta show you how it is
I'm not Eminem, but the flow is just as hard
Let me go again, again
Hebrews
Man, I'm talkin' 'bout the Hebrews
These dudes talkin' 'bout me, but they news
They need to know, but you know how I get it
In the morning he brews that hot tea, cause ya knew
King Solomon
Talkin' 'bout the King Solomon
Anybody steppin' to me, you know that I'm bombin' 'em
Droppin' them off the top
And then I go on again
Dang, I'm gonna off and then on again
Wax off
John the Baptist
John the Baptist
You know I'm flowin', this is Andy the raptist
I gotta tell you how it is off of the top, seein' the tactics
And they tryna hate on the boy cause I got glasses but
Mount Sinai
Talkin' 'bout the Mount Sinai
Ya know how I'm flowin' off the top, it's harsher than cyanide
Oh my God, where am I gon' go from here?
Ya know this real
Everytime I go off the year
Your place in hip-hop
My place in hip-hop
Well, I'ma say the bottom cause that's really the top
The first will be last, if you know what I mean
I'm goin' off, and ya know really where it is when I laugh
Man, I can't stop
We could do seven fingers of death, eight fingers of death
Let me represent
I'm goin' ten fingers in, ten toes deep
Ya know how I go again, yeah, the boy flow again
Come on
Shout out Reach Records
Shout out Reach Records
My man Lecrae
You know that's how I'm gettin' desperate with the flow now
Because my mouth is gettin' a little sticky
You know that's what I'm talkin' 'bout, cause I need some agua with me
Shout out to the homie, that's KB
Derek Minor, everybody, you know that's how we flow B
I gotta shout out Trip Lee, and where you been at?
If you don't know them, you need to go they record ASAP
Get it
