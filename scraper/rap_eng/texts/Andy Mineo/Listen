[Verse 1]
Beautiful condescention, my Savior from the heavens
Laid his head among men, redeem humanity was the intention
Some think he only gave a moral lesson
Well if you believe that
You missing the point like run-on sentences, ah
After I die be rerssurected
My family will be chilling in the sky like the Jetsons
So I bow my head for the meal, thank God for His provision
Reminded this ain't the only bread that I need for living, boy
That sin you living isn't freedom, that's prison
Trapped by your own conviction reminded the closck's ticking, uh
Through many years of rebelling, heart's growing cold as a blizzard
Only the Gospel can melt 'em
So many rappers be using His name in vain
Talkin' how you keep it real
You kidding, what you mean?
You talking how you flipping money, plus you getting green
When you laid up in that pine box, time stops it seems
You wanna live fast, die young
You dummy live wise, die ready whenever the moment comes
The power of life or death reside in the tongue
So we usin' every breathe to lift up the name of the Son, ah

[Hook] (x2)
I came to lift 'em all high
And can't nobody tell me different
And if faith coming through hearing
Well, I hope all of y'all listen up

[Verse 2]
I'm going back in, this is round number two
Found in the truth
Drinking living water like the fountain of youth, woo!
Forever young I live eternal
People are gon' burn you
When they do, tell me who you turn to
Living horizontal, look vertical
Men hold on, eyes forward, stand tall, no urinal
Man is a servant who, die to himself
Put his pride in a funeral
Bury me with no tombstone
I speak the truth, but y'all don't wanna listen
There's souls to be won so I say let's go get 'em
They talking 'bout cards when I say I go fishing
I still hate religion, why you think I'm a Christian?
They wanna know the difference
The piece between God's been broke from our sinning
Religion is man using his good deeds, trying to close the distance
But we can never reach Him
Only Jesus came to get us, man

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ayo, yeah
