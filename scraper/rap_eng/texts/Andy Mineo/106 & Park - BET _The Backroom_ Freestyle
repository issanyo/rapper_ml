Welcome to my classroom
I'm the orator for the moment let's use this backroom
Now feel free to take notes on this lecture
Save your questions for the end, may I begin
Well, first the dilemma
Everybody wanna shine like a diamond
Nobody wants to go through that pressure
It takes, time, refinement and push the miles for excellence
If a rapper tries to sum me I guess you can call me Oedipus
Kill 'em
I am hip hop's four elements
With a touch of heaven sent, let me address them elephants
Is he Latino?
He seems to be lacking melanin
When I black out on that microphone all that chatter's irrelevant
Stadium packed out
We rap about everything we wanna
Yada Yada [?]
On a scale of 1-10, one-sixteen til He come again
On a mission with this pen I ain't missing
Listen, I feel like
King David who just slayed the Goliath
Holding his head high while these haters remain quiet
Shhh, I ain't lying but you ain't gotta believe me
It's something you've never seen like what's under Sway's beanie
Call me the game genie
Sort of feel like I'm cheating
There's more to like than chiefing and going out every weekend
I'm treating this beat like a piece of meat that needs to be eaten
Men move out of conviction, not out of convenience

I ain't trying to preach to the choir
Iâ€™m trying to reach in the fire
We got war overseas but got no peace in the Shire
And they wonder why these kids gotta rob, huh?
Cause you can get a gun faster than you can get a job
Pressure applied
I ain't puffing a lie
I'm already with the Most High, write my bars as I fly, meaning
Travel so much got status on every airline
Til I'm far back, LeBron's hairline

Carolina blue tips chillin' on them 14s
Had them back when I was little sort of like that rapper from New Orleans
Only sure thing in life is your death
I pray these rappers know that dude who's hanging on their neck
Yeah, I know Him well, so I ain't even stressed
If Kim Jong was taking photos it wasn't posing a threat, nah
I'm engaged now so I tell them ladies later
Quit hitting on me like Solange in the elevator

You know what I tell a hater?
Nothing, it doesn't bother me
Honestly I'm an Anomaly breaking them off properly
Why these second string rappers trying to start with me
I'm an organ donor but nobody want no parts of me
All about that blood like I hit an artery
This that Jesus talk, you don't wanna see me start?
Well you better send somebody to martyr me
It's Uptown!
