Rap is such a competitive sport
And my glasses still on, it’s the incredible dork
They wanna try me like the federal court
But I’m unashamed of the gospel I never retort
That statement other rappers are whack sauce
DJ treat em’ like Mr. Miyagi and turn their wax off
Preachin’ God’s standards, they all fall short
Like tryin’ to shoot a medicine ball from half court
Dissin’ God, well you better abort
It don’t go well for you, there’s Hell for you
I’m tellin’ you all, and I don’t want to see you perish
But you wanna ball so hard like them ninjas in Paris
Kawasaki, they wanna put me in a box like Rocky
‘Cus I talk about God, but not me papi
Let me keep it honest like I had too much saki
Some people say I’m cocky, I just know that God got me
Feastin’ on God’s word, I chop it up properly
Watch me put it down raw like hibachi
Uptown New York City where you can spot me
Somebody told me I’m the only thing that can stop me
Never will I grow beyond the servant
Snake skin on the strap back but I’m free from the serpent
Everybody worship, even if you’re not churchin’
What you’re livin’ for is God, power, pleasure or your job
Some livin’ for their clothes, call it True Religion
But ya’ll ain’t tryin’ to hear me like them demos I be gettin’
I think they get the memo, there’s Christians in the building
And they be getting’ higher than the keisha that you twistin’
Ya’ll now how to get, encounters with the most high
You don’t need to blow lye, come and get to know jah
I’ll introduce you to supplier
Cus he don’t want your deeds boy, he wants your desires
It’s hard to spit fire when you hardly get inspired
By the genre you inside of
Everybody wanna try to be something they not
Well guess what- do you
I’m still covered in his blood like su woo
