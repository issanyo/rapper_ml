Never bored

[Verse 1]
Gnarly
Never bored, but I got a board
That I put on all fours
And kick it on smooth floors
It's with me on tour
Even ride it on stages
Red's in the wheels
But I wasn't set claiming
Clicked up, we ain't tryna be famous
People don't get it
They don't know just what the aim is - dangerous
What you gon' say, it's a man who been changed
Who know that to die is they gain?
Yeah! You know what it's like
You know what it's like?
Getting ready for the moment
Getting ready for the night
But I'm getting ready for that moment
Where my faith will be sight
What's the point of getting fly
If you ain't ready for the flight? Ha!
From the sight to the one I follow
Dudes find bravado at the bottom of a bottle
Until they got they face twisted up like a fossil
There's another way to live
You ain't got to know somebody; tell 'em!

[Hook]
(Say ayo!)
Come and kick it with the team
The party's over here
Let me show you what I mean
We saying (Say ayo!)
I'm on that 1-16
Homie come and get it right
Show you what the clique like
(Say ayo!)
Come and kick it with the team
The party's over here
Let me show you what I mean
We saying (Say ayo!)
I'm on that 1-16
You can come and get it right
Let me show you what the clique like

[Verse 2]
Wheat
Corey told me 'bout Da' Matrix
Not that I'm about it
I don't bang with the same set
That I used to claim
See look it I ain't famous
Some people know my name though
I just wan' remain low
So that that I don't take it to the brain, brain
Catch me underground on the train ridin' slow
That's where I compose
All my wickedest flows
Being from New York
Oh, it can have its pros
And its con Edison's bills high like it smokin'
Some are uptown, it's like an expo
Like some exposed skin, like a triple x show
Me and my dogs flee, we don't need a vet though
But my flesh be itchin'
Get it, you starting I'm trying to finish
Enjoying God's gifts
You know what the dish
Up in Barbados, they made us through flyin' fish
We been all around the world
Me and the whole clique
Unashamed everywhere
They holla' 1-1-6, sayin'

[Hook]
(Say ayo!)
Come and kick it with the team
The party's over here
Let me show you what I mean
We saying (Say ayo!)
I'm on that 1-16
Homie come and get it right
Show you what the clique like
(Say ayo!)
Come and kick it with the team
The party's over here
Let me show you what I mean
We saying (Say ayo!)
I'm on that 1-16
You can come and get it right
Let me show you what the clique like

[Outro]
Never bored
