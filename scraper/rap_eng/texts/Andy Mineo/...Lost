[Intro]
I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost
For some time, for some time
I've been lost

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
I don't think I lost my mind, I think I made it, eh (I've been lost)
I don't think I lost my faith, I misplaced it (lost)
I don't think I lost my pain, I upgraded, ay
Traded fears of being nothing for being a replacement, wooh
Voorhees, Eric & Jason
How you got jaded?
That’s a long story don’t wait for it, ay
We wanna be God and we prayed for it
Almost lost my momma
Almost lost my mind
Almost lost momentum
Gotta make up time
I still got some hope that I'm gon' be alright
But if I lose my happy thought then I won't fly
(I've been lost)

[Pre-Chorus]
I was so high thought I never land
Now I wanna come down
We just hit some turbulence, but if I let go now
How far will I fall
I can't see at all

[Chorus]
When I get above those clouds, yeah
I know that the sun's out, I'ma be alright
When I get above those clouds, yeah
I know that the sun's out, I'ma be alright
When I get above those clouds, yeah
I know that the sun's out, I'ma be alright
When I get above those clouds, yeah
I know that the sun's out, I'ma be alright

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Yeah, tell me who flying this plane?
I might just die in this thang
Trying to keep my mind in the game
Lord, how long am I gonna fly sideways?
This how the twelve must've felt on Friday
But I'm still waiting on Sunday
Got me thinking that I should've stayed on the runway
You get your hopes high, that's a long fall
But better than not hoping at all
So, I bet you if I never had pain
Bet you that I never would pray
Trust Him even when I don't see
That's the definition of faith
I know I got a problem with control, ay
Arrow gotta fly, let it go, ay
You never said I wouldn't go through it
Hmm, you just said I wouldn't be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I was so high thought I never land, yeah
I wanna come down
We just hit some turbulence what if I let go now
How far will I fall
I can't see at all

[Chorus]
When I get above those clouds, yeah
I know that the sun's out, I'ma be alright
When I get above those clouds, yeah
I know that the sun's out, I'ma be alright
When I get above those clouds, yeah
I know that the sun's out, I'ma be alright
When I get above those clouds, yeah
I know that the sun's out, I'ma be alright

[Outro: Andy Mineo]
Yo, I got it
I think I got the cover idea for the first EP
I had this moment where I was on a plane
We was at LGA, it was getting ready to take off
And it just looked gloomy and dark like thunder and lightning
I didn't even think we were gonna take off
Anyways, we started to take off, the pilot was like, you know, "Brace yourself, there's gonna be some turbulence"
We started going through the clouds and everything is shaking
I thought we was gonna die *laughs*
But, when we got through the clouds, it looked like California
It was like sunny and bright and beautiful
It's like I almost had forgotten for a second that the sun like even existed
And, I had this moment where I was like
Yo, the sun is still here
It was here the whole time, I just couldn't see it
And, I don't know, it just spoke to me, so
The thought I had was, why don't we take one of the elements
Take arrow and have it going through a cloud
So, that half the arrow's above the cloud, half the arrow's below the cloud
I don't know, I think it's a dope idea
Hit me back, sorry
