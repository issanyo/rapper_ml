(Andy) Chorus: (0:00:02 – 0:00:27) [Poncho]
I could play the background [Coal keeps the lights on]
I could play the background [Coal keeps the lights on]
Cause I know sometimes I get in the way [without coal there is no mountains]
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
And I could play the background, background [Hey Poncho talk about coal for a minute]
And you could take the lead

(Poncho) Verse 1: (0:00:28 – 0:01:23)
Yea; I’m talkin about coal, it saves the world, and it saves Harlan County. Now without coal there is no mountains; and there is no electricity for us, but it just reminds me of God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost. You see without them three presented we would be nothing here on earth like our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he died and sacrificed his life for everybody. Just look at these beautiful mountains; they are so beautiful and we love them, and love to be around them so when you go on top of the mountain; you look up at the sky, look at the world; just remind yourself that you’re a superstar like me because God is our Lord

(Poncho) Verse 2: (01:51 – 02:45)
There is no reason why that we should be here in the world; doin the things we do. Now we enjoy life, we love havin fun, but we like to party and go all night, and the sin's that’s in the world today; that’s just terrible. We love and enjoy the things of life, but we gotta realize that God is always there for us; when we have success; we earn are talents and we are the future; of the world so don’t think about it, just act about it and participate. We love our coal mines; our coal industry there in Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, all the south states; they represent hardworkin leadership
