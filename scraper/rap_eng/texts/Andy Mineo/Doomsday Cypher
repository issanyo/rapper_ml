[Verse]
I am not gangsta, I am me, I am not you
I'm an anomaly like black anchors on Fox News
I'm livin' uptown, where if you talk slick they comin' after ya
Callin' for that shotgun, they tryna ride passenger
Maskin' up, packin' that pump like it's asthma lungs
These bum rappers been bitin' on some Dracula
As for the bars, this is Attica
But that don't matter, cause that will never get no platinum plaque for ya
Nobody cares if you could body a verse if you never put together dope bodies of work
And even worse, you never love somebody 'til it hurts?
You know your self-worth never been connected to your net worth, right?
My next verse might perplex those like
I need to Wiki that, side tab, search for my dad's Christmas present
Maybe an iPad, dang, my bad
I been gettin' sidetracked, I don't know where my mind's at
Somebody said I'm goin' Hollywood
You ever been to Hollywood?
That joint is dirty and it's kinda hood
It's all good, guess I get the sentiment
Whatever then, pull up on my block ridin' a elephant
Wearin' some M3's with the elephant print, I had to match
I'ma take this up to Pelham then back
You see them dudes on my block?
They been sellin' them packs
You prolly think they lowlifes or some felons
In fact, I see math teachers who know how to add and subtract
Business owners, entrepreneurs, intelligent cats in the wrong element
But ain't nobody tellin' them that, I see it
You get told you dumb long enough, you might believe it
So give me dumbbells, I exercise demons
'Til the Father say, "You done well", on the day that I see him
See, a white man kill somebody then he's insane
A black man kill somebody it's, "I told you that they all the same"
Strange, the picture that the media paints
Teachin' us how to hate any and everything not the same
I threw on a wedding ring, now shawties wanna holla
It's ironic, I wonder if she grew up with a father
If the devil wears prada, let's be honest
We all got a pair of luxury kicks in the closet
So, here go the white boy
Yeah, I know they doubt me
Even on Black Friday you couldn't discount me
I know they hate the fact that I am a believer
They said I couldn't hack it, I guess I'm North Korea
So, here we go, hand in the sky now for a single God
I don't mess with them singles like Forest Hills Drive
I'm married now
Even when I'm plain I'm still fly, cause I'm gonna point 'em to the Most High
You see me?
