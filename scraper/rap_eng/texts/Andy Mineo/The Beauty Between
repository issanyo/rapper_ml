[Intro]
Fortunately fall into the beauty between
Only God above me, painting my scene
Fortunately fall into the beauty between

[Verse 1]
I couldn't wait for the summer
But now I'm missing the spring
And I exhausted the winter
Craving what it couldn't bring
Painting the world to be hopeless
Painting it perfect and fine
Put what I want on the canvas
Every color my design
How do I hold all of the discord?
All of my answers collide
Fighting for progress in quicksand
There's no truth between the pride
Nobody sees all the pieces
Tricky to balance a beast
I am a pendulum swinging
Still, I know You're holding me

[Hook]
When the sky is falling, when life is a dream
I fortunately fall into the beauty between
Only God above me, painting my scene
I fortunately fall into the beauty between

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Hey now, all the pressure on me got me
Weighed down, nowadays I’m lookin' for a way out
Instead of gettin' out what I’m supposed to
Through that situation God brought me closer
It ain’t "todo bien"
But I dosey-doe with the pain
And a dose of that is like soap
In an open wound to be cleaned
Gotta happen though it hurt
Gettin' better feelin' worse
I’m just happy that I work
Stackin' bread instead of dirt
I'ma adjust the perspective
What’s an election?
Love is a weapon
Trust in the Blessed
Holes in my faith I hold em in tension
Made a profession
That became my profession
The answer came in a question, like
“If it all fell apart would I trust in God?”
“And if it’s all good would I need Him at all?”
That’s when I found that beauty in between
If you know that you don’t know that much
You know just what I mean

[Hook]
When the sky is falling, when life is a dream
I fortunately fall into the beauty between
Only God above me, painting my scene
I fortunately fall into the beauty between

[Bridge]
Give me water, lifted up
Take my time to taste the cup
Realize a different story
Full of life and full of glory (full of glory)
Give me water, lifted up (lifted up)
Take my time to taste the cup (taste the cup)
Realize a different story
Full of life and full of glory (full of glory)
Give me water, lifted up (lifted up)
Take my time to taste the cup (taste the cup)
Realize a different story
Full of life and full of glory (full of glory)

[Hook]
When the sky is falling, when life is a dream
I fortunately fall into the beauty between
Only God above me, painting my scene
I fortunately fall into the beauty between

[Outro]
I fortunately fall into the beauty between
I fortunately fall into the beauty between
I fortunately fall into the beauty between
