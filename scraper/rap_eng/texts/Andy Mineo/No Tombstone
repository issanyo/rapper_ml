[Hook: Andy Mineo]
So bury me with no tombstone
Cause I don't care if they know my name
To Christ be the glory, let my life story show his fame
And if I don't represent, I know my whole life's been in vain
So Lord what I'm asking for is your strength to endure

[Bridge: Andy Mineo]
Strength to endure this present pain, yeah
Strength to endure this present pain
Oh Lord how I need you more and more and more
More [x12] (I need you more)

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Uh
Lord your strength is what I'm needin'
I want to see your face, I need grace in this season
Cause lately just praisin' ain't bein' so easy
Like my hands weighed down with the cement
I see them heathens puttin' weed in the spliff
They tell me "Drop Jesus, all you need is some of this."
Well, sometimes I want to give in, I admit
Just creep with a chick, make money, put that beat in my whip
But then I think about the Lamb beaten and whipped
And how them fleetin' pleasures can't compete with the gift
Of sweet salvation, they put nails in his wrists
So between me and God all that beef would be switched
Lord, I need your strength in the midst of this storm
I read this, "in my weakness then I am made strong?"
Yo, I want to know what it means like never before
So I seek your presence with my head to the floor
I need more
More [x12] (I need you more)

[Bridge: Sheena Lee]
I need so much more
I need so much more of you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Uh
Lord your strength is what I need right now
Cause every morning I wake up, I'm laying my life down
For the sake of the Gospel, compelled by your love
So, when my mouth don't speak, I hope my life does
When my mic's unplugged and I ain't rockin' stages
What will people read when they see my life's pages?
Christ and his greatness and desire the same?
Or a man who was once on fire, but never was again?
I seen so many men of the faith, fall on their face
And I know the wickedness of my own heart's so great
So I'm begging for your grace, for the day that I was saved
I need strength to perservere until the end of this race
I need

[Bridge]

[Outro: Andy Mineo & Sheena Lee]
I said I need you more
I said I need you more (yeah)
I said I need you more
Yeah (I need you more)
Come on (I need you more)
Come on (more of you)
Come on, yeah
