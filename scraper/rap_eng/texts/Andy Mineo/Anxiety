[Verse]
My heart it run around in my chest
Even in my bed there’s no rest
Your voice is so loud
And nobody hears that sound but me
I hope I don’t drown
My air is trying to leave
Try to breathe for a second
Make believe for a second (it’s all in your mind)
That it’ll be alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
That it’ll be alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
That it’ll be alright, alright

[Break]
Anxiety is fear mixed with control, when you can't control something the only thing left to do is to rage

[Outro]
I was feeling like my career was done
I was feeling like I was washed up
See I got on that bus and I said I'm gonna make this just for song for me
And I don't care if nobody like it
And I had no producers on the road and so I said no I'm not gonna wait on anybody
I'm gonna make this beat myself
Then I had this little melody idea and it came to my mind and I recorded it with my voice duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, and that's when I took that little recording of my voice and I put the distortion pedal on it, and I made it sound crazy, and I made it sound just like this...like this
