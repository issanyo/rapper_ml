'Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse]
They say I play too much, you right
They say I play too rough, you tight
When I play, I don't play
That's wordplay
My jersey, this whole team is [?]
[?]
I eat y'all like cheesecake on my cheat day
That's easy
[?]
Tell me what you think
If you pull a fast one, throw it by the sink
Everything ain't always what it seems
So we root, root for the home team
If we don't win it's a shame
But I never been in that since I came up in the game
I defend that [?] title, word to [?]
[?] see you later [?]
And my [?] always the same
I'm only up against me
How many of y'all push [?] to get up
You push up [?]
Got a couple tricks up my sleeve
[?] the [?] seats
Couldn't afford the [?]
Now my bucket list is lookin' like it's ready to [?]
You want to start somethin'?
Pffft, they ain't talkin' to me
[?]
[?] listenin'
Man, I'm only off for a minute then we out
[?]
