[Verse 1]
Feel like I'm boxed in, been slept on like a box spring
But when them box offices open, the fam flocks in
Who needs the keys to the game when you got the locksmith
Cook any beat I get on and serve it to Action Bronson
Hit you with the drop kick, uh, you cannot win
You got a better chance pole vaulting off of a chopstick
167th, that's where my block is
Where dude's serving them potheads, trying to get that guapage
Uh, they talking about hip-hop is getting Cloroxed
What you think about my color when the flow is tighter than Fort Knox
So who cares about my sort of skin
If I got lines like the bottom of them Jordan 10's - I'm sure to win
Dropping unexpectedly like them red Yeezys
Or even them Beyonce CD's
I'm gone get this back like LeBron gonna hit the three-peat
I said it, when I'm done I'm gonna get a threepeat
Yo, I bought the lie that hip-hop sold me, so where's the receipt?
Everything they said that was about me - delete
At least 25,000 sold on release week
And if you ain't never heard of me, well it's time to meet me
I told my boys I'm on Sway, they said forreal bro?
You better break a leg, but not like Anderson Silva
I told them that I think I'll survive, but keep them fingers twisted
Two in the middle like Westside!
I had to do that one for Tech
Growing up on this show, now I'm finally on it, gotta show respect
They can't stop me like Yeezy on a rant
Can't stop me like Muggsy Bogues trying to play Durant
I'm the only rapper with a Go Pro, shooting my own shows
So go to AndyMineo.com if you don't know
Okay, shameless plug back to the music
I ain't even told you the reasons yet why I even do this
Student of a dude who lived 33 years of life
And showed me what it means to be a servant and sacrifice
And it ain't hard to name, the fella that I'm talking about
Jesus the God - not Charlemagne
I went to college up in Harlem mayn
I guess Jermaine ain't the only rapper who got bars, and a brain
Encore, they telling me to please stay
So I told Dre to cue it up, that's my DJ
Life's moving fast I need a slow-motion replay
You lying, only time you did a bid was on eBay
God is dead, that was said by Nietzsche
Hip-hop is dead the legendary MC's say
Yo I'm proof that both are wrong and if you don't believe me
You finna take a L like that grey train to BK
Get to walking, get the cheesecake
So ill you can't treat me, like a party on weekdays
Sway everyday we get it let me eat pray, pray
Now for 'em now we get it, aye
