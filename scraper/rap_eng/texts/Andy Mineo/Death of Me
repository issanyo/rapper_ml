[Verse 1]
Pocket full of boarding passes
I don't know what city I was in last
But I'm out here tryna make a impact
Same time keep myself intact
They say, "Take it, take it easy A like it's gym class"
Tell me how I could?
There's slaves in the world, before I die, tryna see us end that
So I move fast, Ramadan
Move fast, Autobahn
Who cares if I ever get a Grammy nom
If my soul take L's, phenomenon
Still can't believe I get paid for this
As a kid, all I did was pray for this
Now I'm livin' out my dream, craziest
Got me really feelin' like I was made for this
At the same time never knew how dangerous
It could be when lives start getting changed to this
When somebody say you they favorite
Guess it carry some weight to it
You know, cause uh
That's power and that's influence
The temptation is to use it for myself and serve somebody else
I'm sittin' here buggin' just rememberin' what them rappers showed me
How to bag a honey, stack the money
They said I was a mac by the number of shorties that I could smash
Now I'm waitin' on that matrimony
Cause I've been changed up
Lil' homie came up
It's depressin', kickin' it with dudes I used to look up to
They still on that same stuff, what!?

[Refrain]
I ain't have no role models, now I gotta be one
I bought the lie hip-hop sold me, man I want a refund

[Hook]
I feel like it's the real me, feel me?
Yeah, I been changed, but I'm still me
What I am now, not what I will be
I'm tryna give life
But this could be the death of me
The death of me
This could be the death of me
(Just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The death of me
This could be the death of me
(Just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Look, mama feel like she losin' me
To this lifestyle that's consumin' me
I travel every weekend even when I'm weak man
You know what that to do to me?
Back pain, back pain
Sleepin' on planes, I'm feelin' like Bruce Wayne
Blackout at night on that stage
Man I need a Batcave just to get away
Jesus retreated, woo!
To speak with his Father, I know that I need it
My career been growin'
But tell me where I'm goin' if my time with God is depleted
God I'm sorry, I mean it
All I want to do is walk with you, but
My priorities wrong, I talk about you more than I talk with you
One of my mentors taught me whenever things get foggy
If you wanna grow in God it's not complicated it's just costly
Gotta spend that time, currency
Overtime guess I learned to be
Strong enough to admit I'm weak
To meet with God all I need is me
2014 'bout to be different
I think my favorite word'll be no
Opportunities come and they go
But none of them is worth my soul
That's somethin' that you can't afford
And got me thinkin' what's most important
I get kicks, watchin' grown men in line for some Jordans
Nowadays time is fortune
But chasin' fortune is all consumin'
I feel like God's callin' dudes
They just wanna play Call of Duty
This that Peter Pan, at the dinner table out in Never Land
Eatin', can't nobody see it but me and my boys
That's the way I wanna keep it
I lost a couple friends to this new season
Jealousy and hate for a few reasons
Used to be down, now what's up?
Guess everybody around when the fun's up, yup
Got me feelin' isolated
Women wanna holla, I just tell em' that I'm taken
Even if I wasn't I'd be slow for the taking
I'll know if they love me or the money I'm making
Ain't no way to really tell
Where somebody heart truly at
Bad girls comin' at me looking good
Showin' off they body that's a booby trap
Beard low, but I never let my guard down
Buddy, I ain't crazy
You ain't bout' to catch me slippin'
Pull a Million Dollar Baby!
Me and Dre trying to eat good
Cuttin' out the nonsense
On the road trying to give life
But I might lose mine in the process

[Refrain]
I ain't have no role models, now I gotta be one
I bought the lie hip-hop sold me, man I want a refund

[Hook]
I feel like it's the real me, feel me?
Yeah I been changed, but I'm still me
What I am now, not what I will be
I'm tryna give life
But this could be the death of me
The death of me
This could be the death of me, uh
(Just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The death of me
This could be the death of me
(Just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
