[Intro]
You know, when I look around at everything it just blows my mind to think, "Where'd this all come from?"
So I got some questions, like yo...

[Hook] (x2)
What's it all about, why are we here?
If there's no reason why do I care?
A lot of people put they thoughts in my ear
But I gotta know for myself
So, yo, God are you really there?

[Verse 1]
Man Imma seek the truth 'til my brain hurt
I'm just another soul
My life's like a sand grain in the dirt
If we was made for a greater role
Than just living to die
What's the answer, I gots to know why
I don't want just another nice job and a ride
Cause plenty people got that, and wind up committing suicide
So I really don't care 'bout the physical
Cause I know some, know some millionaires that's miserable
My search goes deeper now, I'm asking more people
Like, "What's the meaning of this life for us creatures?"
The response I keep hearing back, "Love, live, laugh"
Man I already found that on a t-shirt
Some people wanna get tweaked like philosophy class
They smoke reefer, drop acid, pop liberty caps
But that's misery
Within itself, no up or down, right or left
So I guess you're left living right
Man that's crazy, I'm searching for an absolute
No vodka, I just wanna grasp the truth
Cause if I don't then, yo, what a waste
I might as well dig a hole in my grave
They keep telling me...

[Hook]

[Outro] (x2)
Yo God, are you really there?
