[Intro: Marz]
Looking in the distance
I'm dreaming of a world for us
When the moons align we'll map out a journey for you and I
For you and I

[Hook: Marz]
In the night I'm alone
Without you I'm drifting on
When you take my hand
I'm so high up I'll never land
Up, up, up, up, up
I'll never land
Up, up, up, up, up
I'll never land
Up, up, up, up, up
I'll never land
Up, up, up, up, up
And I'll never land

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Everybody wanna be on top
I don't think they know what that means
But you get there you can't stop
Everybody gunnin' for ya' spot, aimin' at ya' team
I'm up all night, chasin' dreams
Everything change when you go from seein' it all
Big screen to behind the scenes
Leadin' us on like it's the life they lead
You know the rich and famous kill theyself to stay rich and famous?
Very same thing they they built they name with
Be the same thing they they be enslaved with
So, I don't want rap you can have that
I don't want the crown, yo', I'm aimin' past that
Headed for another throne can't have that
That's a Kingdom where my dad's at
And I'm His son, my sin gone, so death won't have that last laugh
Child of a King, royalty, that's ASCAP
They want glory, money, and power before you go
I promise you it's empty, we aimin' just way too low
I know we own things we don't need to impress people we don't know
Then we go broke trying to look rich
I can't do it, I just won't
My new goal is to be close to the one that made my soul man
Them other highs gon' let you down
I'm tryna get so high I'll never land

[Hook]
In the night I'm alone
Without you I'm drifting on
When you take my hand
I'm so high up I'll never land
Up, up, up, up, up
I'll never land
Up, up, up, up, up
I'll never land
Up, up, up, up, up
I'll never land
Up, up, up, up, up
And I'll never land

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
I am Rufio with the ripped jeans
Kool Moe with the 16's
In a studio, Michelangelo with a microphone writin' Sistines
But these songs ain't for the chapel
Try to build with others, your own attack you
Try to be a light and they blowin' the match you lit
Can't use a shotgun to catch a fish
I'm on usin' a different tactic
Call me a boom-baptist
Look at this rap cat with glasses, cookin' the track
And every time I look at my past
I laugh like, "Heh, you know where I should have been at?"
Nowadays I just wanna make a classic
Tryna to set the bar way above the average
Then smash that for the glory of God
And do rappers like Apple, leave 'em without jobs
Sittin' on the writer's block
Pennin' everything that I've been in and out of ever since the album dropped
Things changed, get the feelin' they won't stop
I don't want to grow up, Neverland got no clocks
But, let me give 'em bars and no shots to catch up
I got a message about a blessin'
But it's written in cursive
You gonna face death, I know the one to reverse it, listen

[Bridge: Andy Mineo]
When I say I get so high
I ain't even talking about sticky, no lie
The way up is down
Stay low to the ground and you close to the clouds
Listen, when I say I get so high
I ain't even talking about sticky, no lie
The way up is down
Stay low to the ground and you close to the clouds
For real though

[Hook]
In the night I'm alone
Without you I'm drifting on
When you take my hand
I'm so high up I'll never land
Up, up, up, up, up
I'll never land
Up, up, up, up, up
I'll never land
Up, up, up, up, up
I'll never land
Up, up, up, up, up
And I'll never land
