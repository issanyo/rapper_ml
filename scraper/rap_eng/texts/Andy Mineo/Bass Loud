[Hook: Beleaf Andy Mineo] (x2)
I need my bass loud and my mic up( Bass Loud)
I'm turning my life up( Bass Loud)
It's quiet out there( Bass Loud)
And I'mma turn it up

[Verse 1: Beleaf]
I think I might snap off like Thi'sl
Spazz out like Lecrae
Pass out like Uncle Reece, zone out like KB
Or be excellent like the Humble Beast
I got a recipe for success, Beleaf is no celebrity
But I celebrate with the Huxtables for longevity
I do whatever it takes to get better
Raising my kids in a Cosby sweater
When I was young that was all I had
To get me through the bad weather
That was wholesome TV, now it's all about chasing cheddar
We went from Winnie the Pooh to Honey Boo-Boo
Come on man we gotta get it together

[Hook: Beleaf Andy Mineo] (x2)
I need my bass loud and my mic up( Bass Loud)
I'm turning my life up( Bass Loud)
It's quiet out there( Bass Loud)
And I'mma turn it up

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
My bass up and my mic loud
Live shows, I'm wild
They say white men can't jump, how?
I'm flying into that nice crowd
I'm swagging and I'm surfing
And I hope the body get hurt
Them black girls mad
Cause they perm is messed up from the soak that I'm squirting, sorry
Pulling up in that party, McFlyer than Marty
Oh you got the Ferrari car, the latest like it's tardy
I ain't hating, nah, congratulations
I'm just here to say if you're waiting
For that whip to give you a sense of worth
Well I hope you got some patience, heh
Come and kick it with the team, we like "Ayo!"
Jesus be like Simon, Imma do it if he say so
I be fighting him but can't say no
He molding me, I don't play though
Yeah I'm looking for a wife
So girl lets keep it real, Te'o
Yeah they asking how my queso stack like lettuce and tomato
I take 808s and eat 'em like it's steak and then potatoes
Nowaday the radio be sounding dumb, Cuba Gooding
Yeah I rock that ugly sweater
Boy the proof is in the pudding

[Hook: Beleaf Andy Mineo] (x2)
I need my bass loud and my mic up( Bass Loud)
I'm turning my life up( Bass Loud)
It's quiet out there( Bass Loud)
And I'mma turn it up

[Verse 3: Beleaf]
They like, "boy turn down that ruckus"
I'm like, "The Breax is here, you can't touch us!"
Go ape in here or get replaced in here
They either kick us out or unplug us
So I let my light shine like high beams
Turn it up 'til it's blinding
So they can't see out their rearview
Say it loud so they hear you
When you know the truth, but it scares you
So you hide in those dark places
And I came to shine the light
So don't try to hide your faces
Riding clean, don't mistake us
Even though we took a different route
We still guaranteed to turn it up
So we can blow the speakers out

[Hook: Beleaf Andy Mineo] (x2)
I need my bass loud and my mic up( Bass Loud)
I'm turning my life up( Bass Loud)
It's quiet out there( Bass Loud)
And I'mma turn it up

[Outro]
You know, the proof is in the pudding, dah
The chocolate pudding pops
