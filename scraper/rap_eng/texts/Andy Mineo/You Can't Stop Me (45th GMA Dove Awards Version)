[Intro]
Can't stop (x2)

[Hook: Marty]
You can't stop me

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo & (Dre the Giant)]
Huh, can't stop, won't stop, where the brakes at?
I give 'em that Diddy bop
Like take that, take that, take that, take that
I'mma put in work, I'mma do that ASAP
Throw my faith in rap, but they say don't say that huh?
What I'mma turn down for, I feel like Shaq in nine four
Breaking glass in that backboard, or like Kobe in Toronto, huh?
Dropping 81, yo I drop the 88 (stop, stop)
Ricky Bobby, shake and bake
Sleeping on us should have stayed awake, huh?
Everybody make mistakes like DJs trying to say my name
It's Mineo, say it with me, Mineo, okay great
Two forks high, raise the stakes, I risk it all, I take the hate
It's the winning team, get the Gatorade
My God good, but he's not safe, nah

[Hook: Andy Mineo, (Dre the Giant) and Marty]
They try to shut us down, and it ain't gon' slide
Only thing I fear is God and he on my side
That's the confidence of God, 'cause he got me
That's why I really feel like
You can't stop me
That's all you got? Come on with it
That's all you got?
You can't stop me
(You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down (stop)
(Stop), that's not an option, I'm my biggest problem (stop, stop)
(You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down
(Stop), that's not an option
{You can't stop me}

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo & (Dre the Giant)]
You're my biggest opponent (opponent), you know me I know you we know it (know it)
Whenever I fail, you've always been there to simply remind me I've blown it (blown it)
You don't see when I'm growing (growin'), you don't see where I'm going (goin')
You only see in the moment (moment), you know my mistakes you never let go it
Huh, don't cease to amaze me, and it drive me crazy, huh
That you catch every detail that I miss in the songs I'm making, saying
You will never write a verse like Kendrick
Never be to rap what rock got from Hendrix
Top 10 alive you will never be mentioned
Why aim so high, won't survive the trenches
Plus, you a Christian (Andy), they will never listen (Andy)
Plus, where's your pigment (Andy), huh, you don't got skill you a gimmick (Andy)
Well, if I listen to you, and everything you put in my ear
I'll be living like woulda, shoulda, coulda, I'll be paralyzed by fear
Huh, ain't that the truth, if I quit the only way I lose
I got two choices when I do this, (make moves or make excuses)
Huh, if you know who I'm talking about, then you got me
My biggest enemy is me, and even I can't stop me

[Hook: Andy Mineo, Marty & Brian Welch]

[Bridge: Andy Mineo & Brian Welch] (x4)
I said if I cannot stop me then you'll never stop me
Oh no (can't stop)
Oh no (won't stop)

(What I'mma turn down for?) (x4)

[Hook: Andy Mineo, Marty & Brian Welch]
