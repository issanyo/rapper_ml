[Intro]
Look, I don't care who you are
You can relate to this one
You know, some people in your life for short season of time
And it's almost better that you bury the memories of them
Because you already moved on and holdin' onto it just don't make no sense
Sometimes we go and dig it up
Like, just curious...

[Verse 1]
Is it corny if I admit
That I check up on you from time to time when I'm on the net
I promise I ain't no stalker it's so awkward
When I actually come across you I act like I ain't bothered a bit
And you know what that is and I know too
That's pride mixed with lies mixed with I want you's
Kind of maybe sort of or the order could be off
Often I wonder if I regret what I lost
At a later time cause my state of mind make me blind
I pray it isn't if it was I wouldn't admit it
I thought that I was heading in the right direction
But maybe loneliness has got me second guessing
I got some fly women they follow me on twitter
I think I'll DM 'em alright I'm trippin'
But I'm hardwired for intimacy
So why does my loneliness lead to compromise
Oh contentment, come quick!

[Hook]
I'm still curious
(Sometimes) I'm still curious
(I think about you) I'm stil curious

[Verse 2]
Is it weird it's been a few years
We celebrated the ball dropping together (cheers)
The stuff you used to wear, different products in your hair
When I smell'em in the air I feel like you're somewhere near
Is it me is it you was it lie was it truth
Maybe it's just nobody's ever good enough for you
Ok I swear I'm going through asked my homie what to do
He said boy listen here cause I'm finna tell the truth
Everybody think about they ex's
Even if you got kids, married to your best friend
In them memories are easily made but hard to forget
Cause they ex'ed up in your heart the good times and regrets
It's curiosity get you in trouble
Specially if it's forbidden kind that you run to
Ah man yeah you're more sensitive then you'll ever admit
So be careful who you make memories with
The secret is to learn what it means to be content
And celebrate what God's given not the things He didn't
Our heart is always longing for more and it wanna bug out
That's why we gotta drink from that water that never run out
But sometimes

[Hook]
I'm still curious
It takes a moment to make memories
A lifetime to forget them
