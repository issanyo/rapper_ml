[Verse 1]
Hey now
You never call me when you touch down
Okay, that's what's up now
It's like you don't give a what now (what)
Hey now
You only call me when you need something
When you want a little free something
That's not what friends do
Alright, who are you?

[Chorus]
If you knew I was bugging and you stayed quiet
You said I was right when I ain't right
Well that's not what friends do
That's not what friends do
Alright, who are you, huh?

[Verse 2]
Aye oh
Yeah, I know things ain't the same-ol (yeah)
They preyin' on me, gotta pray more (uh)
The devil horns with the halo
And they stay close (uh)
Aye oh, say anything you wanna say though (uh)
And you can even make it hateful (yeah)
You gotta say it to my face, though
Case closed

[Chorus]
If you knew I was buggin' and you stayed quiet
You said I was right when I ain't right
Well that's not what friends do
That's not what friends do
Alright, who are you, huh? (Hey)

[Post-Chorus]
When the last time you think 'bout me, hey
Prolly the last time the drinks on me, hey
When the last time you think 'bout me?
Prolly the last time the drinks on me

[Verse 3]
It's a whole lot of, "Tell me what you done for me lately, only call me when you want a favor"
Turning on you like it's 180, she told me "Don't be a stranger"
But that's not what friends do, girl, I know what that means
If you thinkin' what I think you're thinkin', man, girl I'm onto your schemes
Got a lot of "friends" in air quotes
Dope moments, we share those
It's weird, yo, people that I don't know actin' like we are close
And lately, all my new friends just my co-workers
So where I go when my soul hurtin'?

[Chorus]
If you knew I was buggin' and you stayed quiet
You said I was right when I ain't right
Well that's not what friends do
That's not what friends do
Alright, who are you, huh? (Hey)

[Post-Chorus]
When the last time you think 'bout me? Hey
Prolly the last time the drinks on me, hey
When the last time you think 'bout me?
Prolly the last time the drinks on me
When the last time you think 'bout me? Hey (so when did you get like this?)
Prolly the last time the drinks on me, hey (when did you get like this?)
When the last time you think 'bout me? (when did you get like this?)
Prolly the last time the drinks on me (when did you get like this?)
When the last time you think 'bout me? Hey (I don't know)
Prolly the last time the drinks on me, hey (when did you get like this?)
When the last time you think 'bout me? (I don't know)
Prolly the last time the drinks on me, hey
