[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
They say we all different, what's that common ground?
One day everybody gon' lay in that ground
If death is certain, then how you live it?
And if heaven's real, tell me how you get it
I'm a bet it on my life, it ain't gon' be bout' works
So I bet it all on Christ, boy lemme give you this work

Way before the moment I crawl, I already been in that hurts
I'm already dead, I'm living at my worst
The first to be last and the last to be first
Following Jesus don't mean that there won't be pain, but um
But it does promise that none of it is in vain, and um
And I'm not afraid of that persecution that came
I'm more afraid of the fame and people knowing my name
Take me



[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Take me alive, take me alive
Take me alive while I'm still here
Take me alive (take me), take me alive (take me)
Take me alive (take me), take me while I'm still here

Take me alive, take me alive
Take me alive, take me while I'm still here
Take me alive, take me alive
Take me alive, take me while I'm still here

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Riding low key, ya'll know me
Soli deo glory be to Father
I can't lie though sometimes I want it all for me
Gotta kill that, gotta kill it
Don't conceal that but reveal it
I don't care what you think about me
The Father know it all but I'm still forgiven
I must be decrease cause the way up is down
In His Kingdom it's all flipped as crazy as that can sound
That's why the blood is rushing to my head
Dyin's how I live
If you love your life you lose it
If you lose it, then you gain it, and
Wisdom is justified by all the children
God's worthy of my worship, so I'm defying my feelings
In my mess, there's a message
In my test, testimony
He say no, I get to know Him, when I'm on that Rock you Jabroni!
I cannot be more, stacky dough
Love me some shoes, shoulda cop me two
But I'm thinkin' about the boxes inside my room
And I think about the kids that ain't got no food
Whoo, that one hurt, the truth is a mother
The price of the lies when they come up
Heavy when they run up, the dark will reveal when the sun up
Everyday we're dying

[Hook]
