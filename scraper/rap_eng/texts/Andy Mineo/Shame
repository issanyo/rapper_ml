[Chorus: Josh Garrels]
You fly in circles around my head
While I sit on the edge of my bed
I cry, oh, what have I done again?
It's hard not to hate who I am
It's hard not to hate who I am

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
I chase the moment that when I had it I felt alive
But now that the thrill is gone, I feel dead inside
I feel like everyone know the secrets I wanna hide
And everytime they ask me how I'm doing, I just say "I'm fine"
Too embarrassed to share it or maybe too much pride
I create my own prison, holding the keys inside
Punishing myself for all of these crimes
And I'm trying to convince God that I'm not a waste of His time
What's wrong with me? Am I defective?
I keep on making a mess
Why can't I ever get it together?
Soon people gon' find out I'm not what they expected
They see who I really am then I end up rejected
I try to stand tall, but these knees are collapsing
'Stead of asking for help these apps'll distract me
So lonely, but so many people are friending me
While I post, I hope one day to be happy as I pretend to be

[Chorus: Josh Garrels]
You fly in circles around my head
While I sit on the edge of my bed
I cry, oh, what have I done again?
It's hard not to hate who I am
It's hard not to hate who I am

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Uh, I was thirteen the first time my momma caught me watching porn
She started screaming, she couldn't believe her last born
Was dabbling in something so destructive
I wish I could have said it was my last time, but nah, it wasn't
And the more I thought about it, the more I got bothered
These women I'm objectifying are somebody's daughters
I never really thought I had a problem till it followed me to college
And I felt debilitated by its bondage, uh
Became a Christian, heard about God's power
Couldn't see it in my life, but I could tell you all about it
Overloaded with knowledge, making so little progress
Became a public figure, but my struggles were in private
Only started tasting freedom when I'm being honest
And I learn that when I'm weak is when I'm seeing God the strongest
I know some people gon' be quick to throw stones
But I'll take all of those hits so you know that you not alone
And after 28 years of life, I decided
Everybody's crooked, some just do a better job at hiding it
Oh, how good does freedom taste?
I hope they give me the forgiveness they gon' need one day
I pray

[Bridge: Josh Garrels]
