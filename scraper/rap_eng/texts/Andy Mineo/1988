[Intro]
What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends

[Chorus 1]
Time, you just keep going
And one day you are going on without me
Time, you just keep going
And one day you are going on without me
Time, you just keep going
And one day you are going on without me
Time, time, where you going come back

[Verse 1]
Every coin got two sides, every sword got two edges
Life begin as one ends, how will I be remembered
Mortal men, something 'bout 30
Make ya contemplate the journey
Ya heard me? (Uh)
I told my momma "Can't believe I'm gettin' older, wish that I could stop it" (Huh)
She like "What's ya other option?
You either in the grave or you get another year
So blow these candles out, we just happy that you here"
I found a picture of me back in college
My skin was a little tighter, body was more brolic
My baby face got a new wrinkle up on it by my eyelid
Told myself it must of been from all of this smiling
Life, no one survives it
As much as we want to control it, it just throw suprises
When I was young all I heard was you got potential
But I don't hear that no more, I hear the rent due
And every birthday is bittersweet, it mean our time is shorter
Before I see the Lord I want to get some things in order
29, this the victory lap
My fellows gather around, we just open my gold plaque
Thought I would feel more excited but really I'm kinda sad
Can I do it again or all my greatest days in my past?

[Chorus 2]
Time, you just keep going
And one day you are going on without me
Time, come back, aye

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna do this when I'm 48
Well I could but I ain't cool as Jay
And I ain't cool as Ye
I'm kinda cool with grey
So when the salt and pepper look come
I'm ready for that day
I don't wanna stretch before I play ball or go bald
Lose strength today worrying about tomorrow
I had this moment, I was walking through the park
Saw a boy playing catch, a woman walking her dog
I thought, in a hundred years none of us will be here
Replaced by new people that probably never cared you existed
Just living they life, minding they business
No matter how famous you get, they still forget ya

[Break]
Remember the time, the Beatles said that they more famous than Jesus?
I still think it's funny
Some people didn't know who Paul McCartney was until he made a song with Yeezus
But, millions still gathered on Sunday
Preach

[Verse 3]
Life is less of a line, more like a circle
We can't wait to grow up, and pray for the reversal
Or pay for the reversal
Along the way I learn to enjoy it while you have it
And forgive whoever hurt you 'cause
In the end if you don't get healed, you get revenge
And even if it feels sweet you never really win
It's hard to sleep, lay in bed and have peace when
You became the very thing you hated just to get even
So tell me what you believe in
It's nothing that you say it's what your doing everyday
29 years of life look what I became (Momma)
'Cause I'm a little less eager to prove something
More confident in who I am
It doesn't make for good TV but maybe a better man

[Chorus 1]
Time, you just keep going
And one day you are going on without me
Time, you just keep going
And one day you are going on without me
Time, you just keep going
And one day you are going on without me
Time, time, time, come back

[Outro]
Happy birthday dear Andy
Happy birthday to you
Hey, alright, ok alright
There we go, alright (Make it a good one!)
Yeah, I had to think about it
I'm in here
