I wanna go where the wild things are
I wanna go where the wild things are
I wanna go where the wild things are
I'm talking lions, tigers, bears (oh my)
I'm talking lions, tigers, bears (oh my)
I'm talking lions, tigers, bears (oh my)
Christ died for this terrible heart
That's why I wanna be where the wild things are

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Welcome to the church in the wild
I live with dudes haven't been to church in a while
I've chosen this lifestyle, you ever met my friends?
Porn stars, dope dealers, they like, "Why you chill with them"?
I thought you was a Christian? Yeah I'm on that team
But I'm with them cause my life's the only bible that they've ever seen
Some wanna be an earshot from the church bell
I wanna win souls, make gunshots in the worst hell
Telling 'em Christ became a curse for they sin with my words and my works
They won't come in? I'm bringing church to them
Yeah, that's why I live where I live
They say, "You acting cray, that ain't no place to raise your kids"
But um, if we ain't living it who else gon' show em
What a family supposed to look like instead of them broken homes
Gotta be living stones around where they getting stoned
Live and know Him, die to make Him known 'til He take us home, let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
If you catch me in a bar where the wild things are
With my pastor and an entourage who loves God
Please don't think that it's odd, we kick it 'round broken hearts
Fishing for men, surrounded by sin but ain't taking part
I talk about Jesus, all the Christians love me
I walk like Jesus now they wanna judge me, ain't it funny?
I'm duckin' stones thrown from the Pharisees
Gospel of peace up on my feet like a pair of cleats
Walkin' with the Paraclete, that's Greek for the Spirit
They say the wild things'll eat you up
Who shall I fear when God is walking with me
If I die that's a win, that's the seed of the church plus I get to be with Him
And we so undefeated like Hanes made our sneakers
I had beef with Jesus and my sin it got deleted
So I gotta go and speak it to those who really need it
Let the Gospel off the leash, go and be where the beasts at
