[Intro: Wordsplayed]
Yeah, yeah
Low, low, low (Beam)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Wordsplayed & Andy Mineo]
360 in the contract, never that
I just take the contact, I'll bring it back
I'm runnin' on the fastbreak, behind the back
Yeah, this that, this that, this that Penny with the Shaq
Yeah, if he's passin' me the rock, they might not get it back
They never gave a hand, now they wanna give me dap
I don't know where you been
I got fear of God, ain't no fear of man
These them Air Mineo's, yeesh, need a pair of them, ooh
L.A., L.A., L.A., man, I feel like Magic (Magic)
L.A., L.A., L.A., I can't stand the traffic (skrrr)
Westside for the vacation (right)
West-Westbrook on a isolation
Yeah, yeah, so New York City, gotta keep it Mickey Mantle, uh
The bubble jacket with the periwinkle camo, uh
From Argentina it's a military issue
And Lord said don't mix the pitbull with the Shih Tzu
Don't do it (don't)

[Chorus 1: Wordsplayed & Andy Mineo]
I just threw it off the backboard
Game winner, I'm the one they ask for
Magic Bird, Magic Bird, Magic Bird, Magic Bird (ten, ten, ten, ten, ten)
Magic Bird, Magic Bird, Magic, brrr, Bird (ten, ten, ten, ten, ten)

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo & Wordsplayed]
Yeah, 4th grade, teacher said he need medication
4 shows, 5 days, I need meditation
Six deep, Peter Luger, made the reservation
Pass the check right here, ain't no hesitation
Spotify to show the kid love, I'm like, "What a week"
Everybody tryna get my plug number for the Yeezy's
I told my love, "Baby, we should leave"
Then we go and get the pho, that's that Vietnamese
Yeah, so shout out all the single mothers
2 jobs, 3 kids, I call that a triple double
Call plays in the huddle, God I'm in trouble
Shawties want me sub 'em in, and they sure ain't bein' subtle
Well now the hometown kids finally took the tour foreign
I don't ever ever chase dreams, man I stalk 'em
Had to tell myself, stop grinnin' when they walked in
'Cause you was showing NOLA that New Orleans
Wow, took a Gatorade shower (yes I do)
Gametime I'm like Jack Bauer (thought you knew)
2-3 every 24 hours
They know it's the lo-fi with the most high power
God

[Chorus 2: Andy Mineo & Wordsplayed]
I just threw it off the backboard
Game winner, I'm the one that ask for it
Magic Bird, Magic Bird, Magic Bird, Magic Bird (ten, ten, ten, ten, ten)
Magic Bird, Magic Bird, Magic, brrr (ten, ten, ten, ten, ten)

[Outro: Andy Mineo & Wordsplayed]
(Range) Magic and Bird, the rivarly continues
(Andy Mineo is in the house tonight)
(Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten)
