Ok! I'm a solider in the Army of the Lord
I'm with you if you wit' me, Let's do it for the city
I'm a solider in the Army of the Lord
And if you're comin' then you better come hard!

[Verse 1: Viktory]
Anybody hating get out of my way
Layin' every enemy out on the parquet
Dudes that rather lose, they chill and parlay
I'm 100 of 100 no doin' it part way
Can’t stop thought I told ya'll
See my biz is to win every soul what they go for
And I have gotten older
But I learn how to live every day like a soldier
Black paint under my eye
Gotta bullet proof vest and a black back pack
Wit a 45 on my thigh
Wit a blade in my belt and my boots and map
And I'm still that same ole guy
But a wars goin' on so I gotta be strapped
So Please don’t please don’t try
Cuz' I will if I have to BACL! BLACL!
Like I said im the same old dude
Switch my lane gotta make my move
Its all in the wrist as I switch from the 5th to th 6th
All it meant is I paid my dues
Change my shoes
Run to streets, Sin did to my soul what I’ve done the beat
Used to run from the beef
God gave me a peace, took aim at the lie and said dump on the creep BLAHH!!!!
Set the course and im go
Where we ended up I never knew
Since God is Cheif then ima roll
When its all said and done we coming home
So I set my focus on that Captian up above it
No retreat we ain't tunring back for nothing…

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
I wake up early in the morning fully aware
There’s an enemy out for my soul
Who ain’t bout fightin’ fair
Throw petitions in the air
Cause my Father here
Lord, won’t you lead me not in temptation
But draw me near
Go to war won’t be scared
Because I remember clear you’ve given
Me a spirit of power, not one of fear
So I’m loading up my weapon
You (you .. you) know where I’m aimin
The same one that I uses for myself
Be the one that I use for the schemes of Satan
Writing names on my bullets
I’m prepared when I pull it
Ephesians 6:10 like a clip when I pull it
Fill ‘em up, kill ‘em up
Still get ‘em wit the level that get ‘em without becoming a hit of da nos
Get the canon and I ain’t talking bout guns
My Uzi weighs a ton
Faith in the Son be my motivation
Now in my heart I be meditaton
All up in my city, that’s where God belongs
Prayer be the weapon of a generation
The safetys off and the Son’s power
Faith is the spark, obedience be that gun powder
