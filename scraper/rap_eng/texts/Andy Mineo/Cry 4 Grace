Intro:
This is my cry (8x)

Verse 1:
What choices will I make today?/ Will I be saved by grace today?/ Write my story for me Lord/ Cuz you alone know my end/ I bow my head before your name/ Clear me from my guilt and shame/ Pick me up every
Time I fall/ Forgive me, hear my call

Vamp:
This is my CRY 4 GRACE ::yeah:: I wanna see your face ::yeah:: It’s your will, I chase/ Touch my heart I pray

Hook:
I – I just want to escape/ Take me from this place i’m in/ Rescue me from sin/ Save me
From myself/ Let your mercy meet this matter/ So that after all i’ve gone through/ I’ve been made whole again

Verse 2:
I strayed away from truth and life/ Believing wrong as though it were right/ Still my God, you showed me love/ You reached down and pulled me up/ How great your grace when I confess/ My stone heart replaced with flesh/ I’ve been redeemed by Your mercy/
Now my face reflects Your glory

Vamp:
This is my CRY 4 GRACE ::yeah:: I wanna see your face ::yeah:: It’s your will, I chase/ Touch my heart I pray

Hook:
I – I just want to escape/ Take me from this place i’m in/ Rescue me from sin/ Save me
From myself/ Let your mercy meet this matter/ So that after all i’ve gone through/ I’ve been made whole again
