[Intro: Ravi Zacharais]
The biggest difference between Jesus Christ and ethical and moral teachers who have been deified by man, is that these moralists came to make bad people good. Jesus came to make dead people live

[Verse 1]
Man, first things first
The covenant was made, it was painful and hurt
The Savior was slain but he raised from that dirt
Now I’m covered in His blood, ain’t no stains in my shirt
He conquered the grave, now my faith is secure
Cause my God ‘s still alive while I await his return
So people think they safe cause they stay in that church
But if they only knew it was by faith and not works
By His grace and His mercy, the Father
He'll take a sinful man and make him somethin' he outta nada
He washed away the dirt that I did when I tried to
Satisfy my thirst ouside the living water
Oh, what a great mistake, I wasted so many years
I tried to do it my way instead of doing His
That’s probly why I tasted salt from my tears
But, now I be the salt of the Earth to my peers
Sin brought me so high, but when I came down
There wasn’t enough folly to keep my mind sound
I wanted all the hotties that could get a piece of mind
But there wasn’t one hot enough to give me piece of mind
I wanted fast money, but when I finally got it
The only thing that was filled was my front pockets
I threw all my cash onto kicks and the summer gear
By the time I got home I done got my eyes on another pair
Never satisfied in the pleasures that’s fadin'
Cause I can’t take them to the grave man
Faith in the stacks of the paper
Now I only put my faith in the Savior
It only makes sense
I really don’t care if I never make a cent
If my pockets full of lint I can still sleep well
Cause the God of the universe know me by my covenant

[Hook] (x2)
He saved me
He ain’t take a bad man, try to make a good man
He just took a dead man, then he let him live
He told me get up and walk
He told me get up and walk
He told me get up and walk
So I did

[Outro: Ravi Zacharias]
Man is not just unethical, he is lost and dead. If man is only lost in guilt, what I have given to you is bad news. But he is lost in sin and our great privilege is to tell him he has a savior
