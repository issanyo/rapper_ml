[Intro: Trip Lee]
Yes sir, Romans 1:16
We unashamed of the Gospel
Is it okay if I bring some friends this time around?
PRo, let's go

[Hook: Derek Minor]
All I need is one sixteen
To brag on my King
Romans 1:16
We brag about Him daily cause He runs this thing
Can I do it, do it, do it

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Okay I’m reppin' hard with my flow down and I’m flexin' on like I lift weights
My faith, proactive, put it all in yo' face
We start up deep on a mission only do this
My tribe is on a quest, we in your ear like a Q-Tip
In your hood but they know me, where they got shooters like Kobe
Had a convo' with the King, He said "My sons need to know me"
See my brothers in the gutter, they need truth and I can’t vacate
Plus, Christ He changed my life when it was ugly like Sheneneh
Only need the 116 when I come clean, you can know He rather make this scene
But the cross we international, Mexico I hear them say
“Uno uno seis, please don’t get up in my way
When I get all in the zone, like a cannon I'mma spray, bow”
Died on a cross with thorns in His head
Wasn’t for the Lord, I’d probably been dead
So forget now, take a hit now, kinda like wow when you see the blood that was shed
We on our grind, no sleep like insomniacs
You lookin' for us, you know where we at

[Hook: Tedashii]
All I need is one sixteen
To remix this for the King
Romans 1:16
We brag about Him daily cause He runs this thing
Can I do it, can I do it, can I do it, can I do it

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
K, go
Go in, they’ll Go off
'Cuz He sent for men, they’ll blow off
All this trooper spit 'cuz they so lost, [?] bring the heat 'cuz they in the blind
They make short money just to bring them change
But they need to be remade so they’ll never be the same
So I hit ‘em with the knock off, lift ‘em off the [?]
Get ‘em with the block off, spit it like a wild card
Kick it like it’s muay tai, get ‘em with my squad nine
Sinnin' and sinnin' but quittin', livin' for the Lord now
That’s just the way it goes, that’s since He came and rose
Lovin’ it and livin’ it way [?]
'Cuz I had been a criminal [?] animals He remade, forgave and He did it with the minimal
Can I brag on my Lord? Oh yes, brag on my Lord
He’s holiness so go with this
Matter fact man you should grow with this
He made the world, you ain’t heard?
He made you too, every boy and girl
I’m tryna help you hear the truth
Guaranteein' He’s the reason you made it though
Matter of fact, yeah, I know He is
I jump fly, no DQ
I’m sittin’ high, no [?]
Homie, I’m cold, no igloo
I’m right now, since way back
It’s so true, we sick facts
No, mass but the rest of my time on this rock
Oh boy, you can bet I brag

[Hook: Dre Murray]
All I need is one sixteen
To brag on my King
Romans 1:16
We brag about Him daily cause He run this thing
Can I do it, yeah, uh

[Verse 3: Dre Murray]
I do it for the One who put me back where I’m supposed to be
When the world had me bound and chained up under lock and key
His Spirit took control of me and now nowhere they holdin' me
He moulded me, this murder in the third degree
He put my lights on, yeah, I got my brights on
Shinin’ when it’s pitch black and they say let their right's wrong
Homie says he’s still young, thinkin’ that his life’s long
I hit ‘em with that fo' five and then my homie let go
And so I’m pushin' life just like it’s rocked up
Reppin’ for the King, homie, I’m rocked up
We worldwide, ain’t no tellin' where we pop up
D up all you want, world peace couldn’t stop us
And I ain’t comin' back, you can’t neva' pull me down
Baby, I’m very unashamed until I’m buried in the ground
Even in my death I’m risin' when the trumpet sound
Everybody looks up, it’s about to go down

[Bridge: Andy Mineo]
Let's go!
Unashamed
Unashamed
I'm unashamed

[Hook: Canon]
Now all I need is one sixteen
Tell Smeagle that his precious couldn't be the Lord's ring
K-I-N-G
Block what others bring
And if I don't make the cut
Y'all know what that means

[Verse 4: Canon]
We comin' in with the brothers that’ll hit 'em with the bang
Gotta count unto the Father that’ll ch-ch-change 'em
Lookin' for the sinners they comin' in with the rumors and they poppin' and poppin' with the blood thirsty consumers
And everybody better know split a brother send his others comin' around linger around, Satan come up with a trick-trick plaow
The community we be living in unity, we living the men and the women to following and know we get it started at the cross
Cr-cr-cr-cr-cross (ohh), shall I spit this slow? (no)
Bet he wanna rumble with a couple of the brothers that come and cover the city with the hope
Got me singin' like Figaro Figaro, thinkin' ‘bout the Son of blood spillin' like woah
Give it up like a finger roll finger roll, high up and they painting the face like woah
Y-y-your gonna learn today, man the Son up in the Heavens ain't a little bitty baby in a manger rockin' to amazing grace
He’s showin' his poker face, no such thing as overate
He’s King no negotiating, and He’s overweight
Been packed full of bun and He commands no lower case and had to get 'em

[Hook: Braille]
All I need is one sixteen
To brag on my King
Romans 1:16
We brag about Him daily cause He runs this thing
Can I do it, let's go
Can I do it, let's go

[Verse 5: Braille]
I don’t spit it how I used to spit it and I admit it, yeah
It’s not tryin' to impress the critics
I did it because my heart was different
Heart conditions, switchin’ lanes
The grace of God can change a rapper
No name rapper, famous rappers, amateurs, your favorite rapper
Anybody out there can get it, there’s no limit when it comes to the One
The True and Living God who sent His Son, He said it was finished, the mission is done
That was our sins that He came and died for
The Name above all names became a curse on the cross to take our shame
The Blameless One took our blame
Christian rapper, Gospel rapper, at the end of the day if a rapper is saved
Then the raps that they say and they way that they live should be unashamed
It’s a reaction to the compassion we received when we believed
These so deceived, so now we put that faith in action
Gimme one sixteen with a one one six and I do it like this when the beat hits
I’m broken, but He’s the fix
I know I’m not perfect but Jesus is
So He is my everything
Even when I fail, when I fall and I trip I get back up 'cuz He forgives
So the Gospel stays, on my lips

[Bridge: Andy Mineo]

[Hook: Lecrae]
Hey man all I need is sixteen bars
To talk about money, women and cars, like a star
But if you know anything about us and who we are
You know we use our lyrics to represent for the Lord
Let's go

[Verse 6: Lecrae]
If you give me two I’mma do what I got to do to represent the Truth
No drugs in the trunk, no guns to shoot
Yeah I rap what I live outside the booth yeah
And if you let your boy get fo’
I’mma tell a little mo’ ‘bout the God that I know
How He defeated his foes beat death like a pro
Put Him in a grave for days but He rose
Gimmie eight, out the gate
I’mma brag about my Creator like [?] how he made us [?] haters with his crew we can make it with some aliens, strangers and places
12 forget you’re swell
Tell a coupla tales …
But the money gonna bail took nails in the wrists and then fail to resist the Devil and all his tricks
Now I’m yelling 1-1-6
Glory to the King who redeemed my clique
One sixteen's all I need to commence
Tellin’ the whole world I’m convinced
It’s Jesus

[Hook: Trip Lee]
Uh huh, give me another sixteen
To brag on my King
Romans 1:16
I still talk about Him daily, He still run this thing
Now lemme do it, lemme do it

[Verse 7: Trip Lee]
I get up on the mic and I spit that
[?] really wanna get that
[?]
My King you don’t really wanna miss that
He reigns I’m here so I sit back
See the things that He did 'cuz he did that
He don’t need me, everything easy
When you at a roulette you gotta believe me
I tell them, “Hold up homie”
You might really wanna slow up homie
Promise you don’t really wanna roll up homie
He the best, even death can’t hold Him
No noose to electric chair
No shotgun shots gonna affect this air
Probably 'cuz I’m connected to
That the King on a throne resurrected jail
Boy they should get this clear
They don’t really want to [?]
Tryna take [?]
[?]
No you can’t do that, I’m runnin' to where the Truth at
They just chasin' after wind baby
Yessir they blew that
But I’m chasin' after Him baby
I thought you knew that
When they hear me singing hymns they be
Like, “Where’s your suit at”
Like why do you braggin' on your King instead of your dough today
'Cuz when I see them I’m like cigarette smoke, blown away

[Outro: Andy Mineo]
Let's go!
Unashamed (x2)
I'm unashamed
All I need is one sixteen to brag on my king
All I need is one sixteen Romans 1:16
We talk about Him daily cause He runs this thing
Can I do it? (x2)
