[Intro]
Nobody told me you could die like this
Nobody told me you could die from bliss, yeah
Nobody told me, nobody told me
We never ever saw it comin', no, no
Live it up, live it up
Nobody ever told us we could die like this
Live it up, live it up
Nobody ever told us, we never saw it comin', no
Live it up, live it up
Nobody ever told us we could die like this
Live it up, live it up
Corrupted by the comfort we (love, love)

[Verse 1]
God prepare me for the war
Comfort be the thing that'll make a king fall
Eyes on the Lord, gotta grip that blade of the sword
Tell me how you plan on gettin' swole if you don't ever get sore (hold up)
They say, "Andy, this ain't music for your core"
If they jumpin' ship now, they was never on board
I got enemies, man they wanna see me on the floor
I got frenemies, couldn't even tell you who they are
If you're not driven by the mission, you'll be driven by the cars
Focused on what you been gettin' more than becomin' who you are
I tried to point 'em to the Son, but why they callin' me a star?
Who woulda thought we set they minds free with these bars?
In this game, in this biz, want the fame, gon' get rich
Comfort, everybody wantin' it, never knew I could be lost in this
This my sophomore, gotta go hard
When the show over, no encore
I got enough but I want more, want more!

[Bridge]
Nobody told me you could die like this
Nobody told me you could die from bliss, yeah
Nobody told me, nobody told me
We never ever saw it comin'

[Verse 2]
My own people owned people, but they don't own that
They say racism dead, man our president is black
Two terms in the White House, that don't mean jack
If we still believe our present ain't affected by our past
First class with a Coach bag, I forgot
When you start eatin' you lose your hunger then grow fat
I apologize for Christians with pickets sayin', "God hates fags"
I promise Jesus wouldn't act like that
He said it's hard for a rich man to get to heaven
When we feel like we don't need God, then we forget Him
We tell 'em that, "If you don't make me money or make me happy
Then I ain't makin' time for ya', so make it snappy"
And I think lately you mistake me for a cabby
Cause this drive that I got put everybody in the backseat
So if you wanna live a comfortable life
Make sure you never love nobody, be selfish and never sacrifice

[Interlude]
We got legal weed that'll keep us high
'Round the world other people die
Where on earth is my wi-fi?
Our stomachs full and our pockets fat
I need love, there's a site for that
I had more when I had less

[Chorus]
I think I got too comfortable, yeah
I think I got too comfortable
I think I got too comfortable, yeah
I think I got, I know I got
I think I got too comfortable
I know I got, I think I got
I know I got a little too comfortable

[Outro]
Andy: 'Scuse me, sorry. Uh, sorry. 'Scuse me, comin' through. Sorry, 'scuse me. No, it's cool
Train Dispatcher: The next stop is...
Andy: Uptown!
