[Intro]
We're gonna dedicate this next song to my father, Joe Mineo, the legend

[Verse 1]
Look, August 23rd, how could I forget it?
Getting ready in my suite, it's the morning of my wedding
Invited all my legends, man, it's set to be epic
And then I got that message, I was dreading
My momma said it, “Andy I don't think your father gon' come”
I just laugh, said “Oh well”, and tried to be numb
I learned to stop getting hopes up
As a kid, growing up, that made the letdown easier when he didn't show up
But, deep down I had this flicker of hope
This one time he pull it together, make a effort, but nope
I'm standing at the altar, he nowhere in sight
How I'm thinking about him now instead of my wife?
Best man, Ray, to my right said, “You'll be alright
At least you know you're gonna be smashing tonight”
Then the doors open in the back, wearing all white
This the first day of the rest of our life
Her father by her side while she came down the aisle
She's was looking all wow, then we exchanged vows
Long-winded self, should've passed me a towel
We both said “I do”, we team Mineo now

[Chorus]
So, everyone, everyone smile for the family photo
But everyone, everyone ain't really in the picture
So, everyone, everyone smile for the family photo
But everyone, everyone ain't really in the picture

[Verse 2]
Now the ceremony's done, I know it sound dumb
But I thought he might come 'cause the night was still young
I could've filled his space, it's like a hunnid a plate
I kept two just in case prayin' he'd show up late
Then I wait...
And I wait

I looked Cris in the face and told her nothing's gonna ruin our day
I hate the fact I still love you
I wish that I could turn you off, take the cord to my heart and just unplug you
Damn, man, you my dad, what I did to ya?
To make you not love me, mean what I should to ya?
Look, I don't understand, I'd jump off a bridge
I'd take a bullet to the rib before I'd hurt my kid
You know that Mark told me something I won't never forget
Sounded just like you, that's why I know it's legit
He said, “You go to Andy's football games, but not lacrosse
Why? “You told him you don't like that sport
Well, do you like me? It's sad I gotta ask
You either cry or you try to learn to laugh
Look, I figured I'd be past all this hurt by now
But after all this time it's only worse right now
'Cause when you bury emotions, you bury them alive
They only come back stronger, somewhere later in your life
And on the honeymoon, I got your text, but I ain't reply
Said “Congratulations” like, what a guy
I ain't ask you to be perfect, man, that's only God
I just wish you would have tried

[Chorus]
So, everyone, everyone smile for the family photo
But everyone, everyone ain't really in the picture
So, everyone, everyone smile for the family photo
But everyone, everyone ain't really in the picture

[Outro]
God, grant me the serenity
To accept the things that I cannot change
Courage to change the things that I can
And the wisdom to know the difference
Living one day at a time
Enjoying one moment at a time
Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace
Taking, as Jesus did, this sinful world as it is
Not as I would have it
But trusting that You will make all things right
If I surrender to Your Will
So that I may be reasonably happy in this life
And supremely happy with You forever in the next
Amen
Amen, Amen
Amen
