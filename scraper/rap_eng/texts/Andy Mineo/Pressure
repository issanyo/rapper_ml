[Verse 1]
Feel the pressure, new semester
Everybody's gettin' fly gotta dress up
And parents pay a lot of money they expect ya
To make a lot of money, so you don't wanna mess up
Now you're stressed, huh
Try your best but
Why it never seems enough to impress 'em
And you just wanna hear 'em say "Good job"
'Stead of "Get a good job"
So tell me where is your rest, huh?
And parents feel the strain too, cause they named you
And they got the responsibility to raise you
If you turn out like a demon instead of an angel
Then they be catchin' the blame for bringing the family shame
When kids have kids, they run and abandon
Others stick around, model broken examples
Clean ones nobody's hands is
And sometimes this life's got more questions than answers

[Hook: Co Campbell]
I feel the pressure, yeah
Coming from every side
I feel the pressure, yeah
Knocked down but I'm still alive
When I feel the pressure, yeah
Like where do I run to?
When I feel the pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure

(Verse 2)
Look, you ever feel like you're wandering?
No aims, no accomplishments
Life's passing by, gotta make something out of it
And every time the clock tick
You be so reminded how time flies but you ain't in the cockpit
And birthdays are like the worst days
There's turmoil in your heart but celebration on the surface
Cause Mondays it's right back to that workplace
Where you hate it, but you gotta get paid
Yeah I could feel the pressure too, every time I'm speakin'
On the microphone, different crowds on the weekends
Cause I remember what James said about teachin'
And why is everybody scrutinizing what I'm tweetin'
Signed to that Reach camp expectations way
Higher than decent, I became free when I seen God's peace
Rested in it knowing that He's pleased with me
Now I don't gotta please men

[Hook]

[Outro]
I'm free, I'm alive
Feeling good, alright
And you can't take my joy
And you can't take my joy
I'm free, I'm alive
Feeling good, alright
And you can't take my joy
(Cause the world didn't give it to me)
And you can't take my joy
(Cause the world didn't give it to me) (x4)
