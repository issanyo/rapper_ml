[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
If my life is but a vapor
Then these words are just some molecules, jotted on paper
Not even hot enough to savor
More importantly, I’m sorta geeked
‘Cus up in my Scripture studies I’m stumped
Like what is up with these verses?
They stuck in me brain
Now I’m just waiting to take in the revelation
I’m meditating to gain
Staring off into space while I’m waitin’ up on the train
People think I’m insane, cus I’m contemplating the saying
How could creator, come to creation, save his created, in the frame of a son?
Leavin’ behind his fame, his glory, his place of reign
Where “Holy is the Lord” is what all of the angels sang praises unto his name
And still he left it and came
To kick it with wicked sinners with mischief up in their veins
Worthy of all worship, but still he served us
And even washed the feet of the one that was to betray him… dang
And my sin’s the reason He came
To drink the cup of the wrath of the Father in an exchange
My sins for his righteousness what a gain
Cus 2 Corinthians 5:21 he became... sin
Now I don’t gotta taste the flames, walkin’ in the spirit
It got me flowin’ like David Blaine... yeah
So I’m praying without ceasing
'Cus Satan ain’t Damon Wayans but he sure is a Major Payne
Let’s go

[Break: John Piper]
You never out grow your need for the Gospel. Don’t ever think of the Gospel as that’s the way you get saved. And then, you get strong by leaving it and doing something else. We are strengthened by God, through the Gospel, every day ‘til the day we drop

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
My mind’s steady thinkin’
Dwellin’ upon the Christ while the time tickin’
As I’m inchin towards the wood pine finish
But dyin isn’t the end of it all
Might seem a contradiction
Only to those who missing the aptitude for sublime vision
Combine the boom bap with the rhyme precision
Before we proceed to speak about the truth, define fiction
Outside the Divine Infinite Being we lack the distinction to accurately navigate morality’s system
If you’re thinkin that I’m trippin when I’m continually spittin
About totally deprived sinners, we most go in it
The record ain't skippin but let me bring it back
Every man’s heart’s desparately wicked, I’m wicked
You don’t believe me? Take a second to kick it
Evaluate your heart, lay it against the Scriptures
Every man sins, don’t gotta make a case for the stance
My conscience is my primary witness called to the stand, let’s go

[Outro]
Crushed bones and blood drippin off his face
Framed on wood, now that's a picture of grace
