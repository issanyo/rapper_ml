[Intro: Andy Mineo]
There are so many things that I don't understand
Like why am I so lost if I have a captain?
I'm tossed back and forth by deceitful winds
And if it all falls, look within
I've been breaking hearts way too long
I did this from the start, now I'm all alone
So focus on the heart if you want a home
I can't settle for that cardboard box no more

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Early Christmas morning at the table with my momma
Steam's coming off the coffee, we talking about the father
These are the conversations I cherish and I hold on to
She asked me, "Is there a girl in your life that you're fond of?"
Well, not yet, feels like I'm looking for the Lochness
I ain't even really got a prospect
I don't think I found what I want yet
But let me be blunt, no pothead
I'm going through a process to stop seeing women as objects
Cause the meaning of marriage is not sex
It's so much more, this ain't no beauty contest
When you play that game then somebody's always got next
If charm is deceiving and beauty's vain, then I bet
The standards that we judge most people with are nonsense
I put too much emphasis on my preferences
Dang, I'm feeling shallow just addressing this
Cause God loves me in spite of how much a mess I am is
And I'm writing off shorties whose bodies is less impressive like, dang

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
I'm caught up in this game again
She's asking if we're more than friends
Why is this happening?
I don't know if she the one
But I don't wanna lose her love
I'm caught up in this game again
She's asking if we're more than friends
Why is this happening?
I don't know if she the one
But I don't wanna lose her love

[Verse 2: Swoope]
Cooling back in '01, high school mac was so fun
Making chicks my baby, then on to the next one, Jay-Z
'01 turned to '04, late night games at your dorm
Let's take a walk, your girls hating
We're just flirting, we ain't dating
'04 turned to '06, and you're so sick
Asking me, "Is that your chick?"
And I'm like, "Yes, finna put her in a white dress"
And you cry, I loved you, I ain't mean it, but I said it
Now I'm married with a trail of broken hearts and I regret it, dang
Should've treated you like you was God's daughter
Cause you was, but I got caught up, now I got karma
Comma, 2012 and now I got daughters
And I'd kill the dude that ever do them like I did you
Laundry list of names, that's too long to mention
But I'm the one need cleansing, I did my dirt
And then some pain was never intention
I pray for your forgiveness
Thank God He saved me from my sin but not the consequences, dang

[Hook]
I'm caught up in this game again
She's asking if we're more than friends
Why is this happening?
I don't know if she the one
But I don't wanna lose her love
I'm caught up in this game again
She's asking if we're more than friends
Why is this happening?
I don't know if she the one
But I don't wanna lose her love

She's asking if we're more than friends
Why is this happening?
I don't know if she the one
But I don't wanna lose her love

[Outro]
And all the boys said, and all the boys said, and all the boys again
All I really know is I don't know what I want
Caught up in this game again
And all the boys said, and all the boys said
All I really know is I don't know what I want
