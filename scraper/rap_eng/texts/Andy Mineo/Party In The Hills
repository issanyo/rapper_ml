[Intro: Hollyn]
Yeah, every weekend we throw a party in the Hills for fun
It's drama free and only got room for my day ones
Singin' like..., oh whoa party in the hills for fun
Oh, party in the hills for fun

[Verse 1: Steven Malcolm]
Party in the Hills, it's a celebration
I'm talkin' lit with no limitations
Gotta keep it rockin' with the crew, yeah
Work hard, play harder 'til we through, yeah
Vacay all the way to the Bay, yeah
Up to Hollywood just to get away, yeah
I'm talkin' West Coast maybe on an island
In the Hills, way, way up how we wylin', woo!
On one hundred with the squad
Poppin' wheelies on the block
Tell 'em keep up with the boy
Lookin' at the world and everything we achieved
But blessin' to be successful
Livin to see the dream
Like every weekend we drama free
And we ain't leavin' until the sun come up
Like every weekend we drama free
And we ain't leavin' until the sun come up

[Hook: Hollyn]
Yeah, every weekend we throw a party in the Hills for fun
It's drama free and only got room for my day ones
Singin' like oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (on the weekend)
Party in the Hills for fun
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (on the weekend)
Only got room for my day ones

[Post-Hook: Hollyn & (Andy Mineo)]
Day one, day ones
Shout out to my day ones
(Day ones holla)
Day one, day one
(It's time, it's time, it's time)
(Who e)

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Look, I've been workin' OT
Feelin' like I need a trip to the OC
Cause NY been cold OD, got a little numb
People actin' like they know me, nope
What up Prop and Beleaf?
They gonna roll up, I ain't talkin' no leaf
But I say, aye, what up blood
What up cuz, what up gangstas!
Speakin' 'bout 50, I remember chillin' in the office with him
He told me, "Andy don't you ever let 'em box you in
You only rap for the Christians, that be a sin"
I grew up on that juice and the gin
I don't drive slow but the cruise on ten
Got a few with me, I don't need new friends
Take a trip, see things like hallucinogens

[Hook: Hollyn]
Yeah, every weekend we throw a party in the Hills for fun
It's drama free and only got room for my day ones
Singin' like oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (on the weekend)
Party in the Hills for fun
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (on the weekend)
Only got room for my day ones

[Bridge: Hollyn & (Steven Malcolm)]
Party, party, party
Party all day, party all night
Party, party, party
Party all day, party all night
(Party all day, party all night
Party like a rockstar, party like a rockstar
Put them hands in the air, it's about that time)

[Hook: Hollyn]
Yeah, every weekend we throw a party in the Hills for fun
It's drama free and only got room for my day ones
Singin' like oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (on the weekend)
Party in the Hills for fun
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (on the weekend)
Only got room for my day ones

[Outro: Hollyn & Steven Malcolm]
Party, party, party
Party all day, party all night
Party, party, party
Party all day, party all night
Shout out all my day ones
Party all day, party all night
Yeah, shout out all my day ones
Party all day, party all night
Shout out all my day ones
