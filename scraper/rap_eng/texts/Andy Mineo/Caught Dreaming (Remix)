[Intro: for King & Country]
I'm caught dreaming (I'm caught dreaming) (x3)

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Why waste my breath singing words of praise
That are filled with myself? (Who's greater?)
What love do I have that you didn't give
Cause all that I am is a product of grace
And what should I trust, your love for me
Or my love for you? Who's greater?

[Hook: Marz Ferrer & for King & Country]
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
And I like singing (ohhh)
A burning tree speaking to me
I'm caught dreaming
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
Bringing liberty (ohhh)
The blood on Your tree is saving me
I'm caught dreaming

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo & Marz Ferrer & for King & Country]
Yeah, mouth full of praise, I love you so much
(mouth full of praise, I love you so much)
What an empty phrase, really I'm more amazed
How in spite of how I fail to (fail to) do what you command to (command to)
Serve other gods like Baal, you never bail
(Serve other gods like Baal, you never bail)
(I'm caught dreaming, ohhh) That's illogical devotion, could it really be
You chose to die for the sinner when nothing was good in me
(I'm caught dreaming, ohhh) You never left me, even when the darkest days began
Nor forget me, only thing you're forgetting is my sin
(I'm caught dreaming, ohhh) I wanna make it to the end, let me remain faithful (remain faithful)
All because you're faithful to me, yeah, I'm grateful
(All because you're faithful to me, yeah, I'm grateful)
My mistakes can never stop the choice you make to adopt me
(My mistakes can never stop the choice you make to adopt me)
The holes in your hands are the proof that you'll never drop me
(The holes in your hands are the proof that you'll never drop me)

[Hook]

[Bridge: Marz Ferrer & for King & Country]
I'm caught dreaming (I'm caught dreaming (x3))
Yeah, I'm caught dreaming (I'm caught dreaming)
I could sing how I love you
But your love is much greater
And I could sing how I love you
But your love is much greater
I'm dreaming
I could sing how I love you, love you
But your love is much greater
And I could sing how I love you, love you
But your love is greater
I'm dreaming (oh dreaming) (x4)
Oh Dreaming (x4)
I'm caught dreaming (I'm caught dreaming (x3))
