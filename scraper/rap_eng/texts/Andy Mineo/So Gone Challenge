[Verse]
My momma told me stop jumping off the stage
I gained a little weight, I see why she be afraid
That's probably why I always bow my head and I pray
If you can't throw the hands then you never throw the shade
The barbershop the only place I ever caught a fade
If you play your cards right you'll be in clubs drinking spades
I never really been a type to ride a wave
Cause I know they all crash, that's why I'm a sure thing
Body made that girl a Instagram star
She ain't work out for it, she just got work out in DR
But that's not my business
Man, I'm Kermit with the glass
Been blessed with the gift of gab
My pen just paid for the pad
I was goin so hard they thought I was gon' drop dead
This ain't happen overnight
Look, this ain't Fetty Wap dreads
This that never stop kid
This that 10,000 hours on the grizz
If you see a man gettin' his, don't get mad just gon' and get biz
Been so cold with the flow I'ma make them lean
I don't mean the codeine, might be ODin, never
Gotta put the work in
Grow, get better
One of my fans went and wrote me a letter
Told how his soul got cleaned, fed up
Schemin just to get the cream up, now he graduated
Livin' that dream up, he's up
Man, what's better?
