[Verse 1: Detox]
They say you won’t but I know you will
You’re the real deal so of course I know you will
I know sometimes I don’t know if you will though
Cause I keep going on with how I wanna roll
Will you fulfill my wills so I can fulfill your will?
You already paid the bill but I’m still complaining
Whining, I’m so tired of myself and my worries
I’m just living life with a plain sight daily
Uh, I got a purpose and I’m tryna use it for the Lord
But it seems like it’s more for me so now I’m bored
Cause I don’t got no duty I’m just living carefree
Married to the game but the tensions in the airy
No time to kill but I keep doing it, man so stressful
Less full, I’m no good, eating stuff that’s not full but so dull
Gotta study more of them apologetics and the bible
Or else I might be heading to the genie as my idol

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Y-O-U, owe me nothing
No nothing [x2]
I know you will [x10]
Even when they say you won't
I know you will
I know you will [x2]
Even when they say you can't
I know you will
No there's nothing you can't do
Nothing in this world too big for you
So when they say you can't
I know you will [x2]
Even when they say you can't
I know you will

[Verse 2: Detox]
Rambling on with my mind unchecked I’m such a mess
May God save me once again, lay down eternal rest
I need a clear vision not my own stupid ones
If the things that I want happened that wouldn’t be any fun
I’m done tryna rule my own life, I wanna live life
I can’t beat the best storyteller at making life
Dead outside, inside, physically, mentally, and spiritually
I tell everything that makes me so weak, no sleep
I keep saying that I will but I ain’t doing it
I keep saying that I’ll move on but I ain’t moving it
Teach the lessons to the children and make sure
That they don’t ever end up like me that’s for sure
I’m not smart, I’m not strong, I’m not brave, I’m not cool
Dreaming and reminiscing not paying attention in school
So can somebody slap me in the face and save me?
Yeah, I’ve been feeling so low and so high lately
