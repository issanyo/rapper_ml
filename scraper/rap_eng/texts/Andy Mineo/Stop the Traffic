[Verse 1]
Yeah so many things I wanna address
A cosmic issue I do my best
These checks are written in blood
We're still buying people
Slavery never left this
20 plus million women and children
These are not numbers they are souls that we dealing with
I'm feeling sick thinkin about the innocent
Girls that get caught up on the strip
Makin money for a pimp
See the gangs so slick
But it happens all the time
Before he broke her body he had to break her mind
And the talkin in the air all the stuff she wanna hear
Stuff her daddy shoulda told her but he probably wasn't there
She 14 he bought her candy and a teddy bear
Bought her clothes got her anything she wanna wear
He got her nails done, told her that he loved her
But he said he'd love her more if she went and made him money

[Hook]
When is it all gon' change
Slavery still remains
Their minds, their hearts
All torn apart
(We gotta stop the traffic)
We must remain
Till we see the broken chains (broken chains)
Your pain Your scars
We'll carry till your freedom is ours

[Verse 2]
To all my fathers that ain't runnin
Please tell your daughters that you love them
And if you dont then somebody else will
Yo they need it just to hear it
They might let somebody touch em
And some use sex to get love
Some use love to get sex
And some use sex to get the bread that they need to pay rent cause nobody gonna do it for the kids
So tell me what's the price in life?
Some children are learnin' how to pull tricks while others learnin' to ride bikes and
This right here been under our noses
How we didn't know this
But now that we know this
Expose the darkness
If we the light of Christ then we gotta stop taking our reality in doses
It's your mother, your sister, your daughter - pray you see her
Cause heroes ain't for sale and the body shouldn't be either

When is it all gon' change
Slavery still remains
Their minds, their hearts
All torn apart
(We gotta stop the traffic)
We must remain
Till we see the broken chains (broken chains)
Your pain Your scars
We'll carry till your freedom is ours

Till your freedom is ours
