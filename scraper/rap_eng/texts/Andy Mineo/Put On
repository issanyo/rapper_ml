[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Feelin' like a million, I don't even need them dollars
Lookin' brand new, I ain't even been shoppin'
The price of what I got no couldn't fit up in your pocket
Takin' off the old self, Christ what we rockin'
Takin' off the old, puttin' on the new
This is what it was, this is what it do
Takin' off the old, puttin' on the new
This is what it was, this is what it do
C'mon!

[Verse 1: Flame]
See, a lotta girls want change so they go to the salon
Lotta dudes want change so they go to the Qur'an
But I can see the end cause I've been where you begun
Where you're so in love with fun sippin' Don Perrion
But you can't see the Son, talkin' S-O-N
‘Cause you're blind to the Son of Man, dyin' in your sin
You might simply deny because of Bentleys you ride
But you're empty inside like they just broke in
That's why you spend a lot of money tryna shop until you drop
If you're out there lookin' hot, that'll make up for what you not
But you can't compare your clothes to Jesus' wardrobe
Talkin' righteousness robes, man your outfit is snot
But Jesus bled homie, I hope you feel this
Real nails got banged in that holy wrist
Real hammers got banged in the spike nail
By his stripes we are healed, tell ‘em how I feel

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Feelin' like a million, I don't even need them dollars
Lookin' brand new, I ain't even been shoppin'
The price of what I got no couldn't fit up in your pocket
Takin' off the old self, Christ what we rockin'
Takin' off the old, puttin' on the new
This is what it was, this is what it do
Takin' off the old, puttin' on the new
This is what it was, this is what it do
C'mon!

[Verse 2: Flame]
I am not my own, lil homie, I been further convinced of that
My life should make music to God, where is my instrument?
Oh yeah, I guess I'm usin' it right now
My life is loud, they say I need to pipe down
I used to think that I was runnin' the show
Jesus traced my steps back like runnin' in snow
It looks familiar like ya done it befo'
A hundred percent, fo' sho, maybe a hundred and four
I know, we all think that we are God on the throne
‘Cause we got some new kicks and they ain't got ‘em at home
Or ‘cause you got a new chick that you got in the zone
Or ‘cause you got a new whip, got you ridin' on chrome
Or I'll tell you what it is, I'll tell you what it really mean
That God's wrath's on your head like the guillotine
You're flyin' high like the bird from the Philly team
You need to get tight with Christ like them skinny jeans

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Feelin' like a million, I don't even need them dollars
Lookin' brand new, I ain't even been shoppin'
The price of what I got no couldn't fit up in your pocket
Takin' off the old self, Christ what we rockin'
Takin' off the old, puttin' on the new
This is what it was, this is what it do
Takin' off the old, puttin' on the new
This is what it was, this is what it do
C'mon!

[Verse 3: Flame]
See it's this little thing called faith that God places in our hands
Then we take it and embrace it, then it makes us a new man
Matter fact, a new creation ‘cause the old has passed away
Now the new has been embraced and now we take the narrow way
If you hidin' from the Christ, do this for the first time
But if you're already God's do it time after time
And then time after time and then time and time again
Be puttin' on righteousness and puttin' off your sin
Let the thief no longer steal but rather get a job
Share with anyone in need as you're workin' unto God
Let the liar tell the truth, let the gossip all cease
We are members of one another so incorrupt speech
We do not wanna grieve the Holy Spirit of our God
Who has sealed us till the day of redemption, now listen ya'll
Grace for the task is what we've been given
Goin' hard after God, that's how you live when you're forgiven

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Feelin' like a million, I don't even need them dollars
Lookin' brand new, I ain't even been shoppin'
The price of what I got no couldn't fit up in your pocket
Takin' off the old self, Christ what we rockin'
Takin' off the old, puttin' on the new
This is what it was, this is what it do
Takin' off the old, puttin' on the new
This is what it was, this is what it do
C'mon!
