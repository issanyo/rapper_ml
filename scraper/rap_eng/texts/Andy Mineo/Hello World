[Verse]
Hello world, ain't no friend of ya
So quit with all the smiles, I won't bend for ya
I'm walking straight, better now than never
I guess I started late, now my heart's awake
When did this all begin?
I guess it's hard to say
All I really know is that something happened inside of me
And it was not my own, I was chosen
Now I'm flipping paper for the prophets
I ain't talking about how my pockets grown
 Not the paper with the dead people faces
Talking about them dudes that I read in them pages
Now I'm seeing clear, but I ain't got Lasik
I’m thinking about my past, I never shoulda made it!
But God in His grace saw it fit to come and snatch me up
I draw the line in the sand, no I ain't backing up
Woo!
Back in the days I was acting up
You know when communion came, your boy had to pass the cup
Pass the bread too, sin I was still in
Offering went in the plate, my condoms almost fell in
Outside I’m feeling cool, inside I'm yelling
Outside looking free, inside's like a felon
Doing time for rebelling
Enslaved to that sin, that I was dwelling in
Bought the lie they were selling like
Go, get as many girls as you can
And get it out of your system now so you'll put a ring on that hand
Down the line when you're thirty
After you had like thirty different women
They so perty, feeling clean, getting dirty, yuck!
Now what a lie from the mouth of Satan
Let’s use logic for verifying these statements
Well, you keep chasing them you’ll only want more
Sin is never satisfied, boy we at war with ourselves
You ever wanted something so bad it was all you could think about
Yo, you had to have it
Then you finally get it, you like it for a minute
But then your eyes pivot, now you're onto something different
We got God-sized longings
Why you try to fill em with them things that you can’t take with you in the coffin, huh?
