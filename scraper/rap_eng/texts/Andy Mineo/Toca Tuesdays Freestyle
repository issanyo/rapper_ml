[Verse]
'Bout to flow it up, ya know what's up
I'm in the studio right now with the boy Tony Touch
Yeah, I get it goin' off the top
They don't wanna see me drop, they don't wanna see me get hot
Speakin' of which I was up on that 97 this morning
They was playin' me at 2
You know that that's the best
And I was lookin' around like, "Is this real though?
I'm on the airwaves, I can't believe this still though
Talkin' right now, freestylin' off the tippy
I got Money Nels with me, he gon' get me
Pull up in that 350, and maybe we gon' skirt off
And you know I ain't comin' with no writtens
Matter fact, speakin' of writtens, let me go and address this
I'ma talk about these rappers, uh, standin' in they dresses
You got other people that's writin' for you?
I don't like that
You can take it back, I'm not gon' bite back
Bitin' my tongue, I'm light in the run
I'm out here fightin' them some
But y'all know what it is though
I'm not goin' off of the top, yes I am
Matter fact I had to hit 'em with the synonym
Boy, I am not Eminem
But I'm white though, I know they like those
I come through with a light flow
I hit you real quick, this is at night though
They see me cause I'm comin' through
I might just have to snipe though
And I don't even got a gun
You know that's how I'm gonna run through these streets
New York City, uptown with me
So shout CCF and everybody ridin' with me
They know just how I get it, throw me any word and watch me flip it
I'ma go ahead and get it, this is real hip, hip-hop
Y'all know I don't stop, Tony Tizza
I see you with the black and yellow, they know what's izzup
Dang, and I ain't even sippin' on the sizzurp
I throw it right now, they just know what's the wizzord
My man over here, cornered lookin' like a wizard
Eatin' all the chicken, that's absurd
I know you tryna get the protein, you know the flow mean
They know me, Andy M-I-N-E-O
Y'all just know just how it go
I had a written though, but I don't even wanna share it
Cause the freestyle right now is goin' ridiculous
I ain't embarassed, I'm kinda feelin' like a clown
Goin' in it cause the flow got 'em actin' like I don't know how to act
So, yo, what's your name?
Vicky? What is it?
Frida? R-I-T-A?
Rita, oh my goodness
So back in the day I had a girl that kinda looked like that one, Rita
Ya know just what it is, I'm not done
So, Rita, I'm thinkin' 'bout that one artist from Mexico
Her name was Frida
And I just saw the documentary
You got to bleed ya with the lyrics, when they puncture ya
And you know that the flow is funkin' up
Yo, I ain't even tryna cuss
But I'm just gon' let 'em know that they gotta know what's up
Cause this right here be that summertime New York, crack the hydrant flow
Rooftop in Brooklyn or that Spanish food in Malico
Bada-boom, bada-bing
That's a paisan thing
Shawty's ice cold, so I had to ice the wedding ring
Hardly wearin' anything, it's hard to keep my mind straight
Them fine dames got fellas actin' like some primates
Visual beings, that's what we are
But she ain't even work out for it, she got work out in DR
Oh, that's not my business though
I'm curbin' with the glass, been blessed with the gift of gab
My pen paid for the pad
Situation with my dad still touchier than a iPad
Ran outta tears, all I could do now is laugh
Sorry to kill the vibe, but these are the thoughts I hide
Sometimes it be feelin' hopless, I don't bring it to God
That's where my faith, pride and my emotions collide
But as long as my eyes are open I know hope is alive
Yo, I finally found my bride, I was waitin' a long time
Before I ever touched a body I was tryna touch her mind
I ordered dessert from the waiter, I said, "Surprise me"
But that's no way to get a honeymoon body, dang
And now I'm eatin' way too many calories
So you know that the boy's lookin' kinda sloppy
But hold up
I gotta chop it up so I could get real choppy
And I be comin' at they hat
And I ain't on the Kawasaki Ninja when I'm ridin' through
Yeah, they just know what's up
Lemme chill, cause you know the flow is up
Uh, get it
