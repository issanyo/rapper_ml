Gawvi, get 'em!

[Pre-Chorus: Dimitri McDowell]
Here we go again in circles
I think I heard it all
We been here before
But we need something more
Something more
Something more
What you say?
I can't hear 'cause you

[Chorus: Lecrae]
Ain't talk 'bout nuthin' (ain't talk 'bout nuthin')
Ain't talk 'bout nuthin' (ain't talk 'bout nuthin')
Ain't talk 'bout nuthin' (ain't talk 'bout nuthin')
Ain't talk 'bout nuthin' (ain't talk 'bout nuthin')
What you talking 'bout?
They be talking 'bout the same ol' thing
I'ma have to call a foul in the game
What you talking 'bout?
A little money now you all OG
Talking 'bout it's all eyes on me
They ain't talking 'bout nuthin'

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Lemme guess you counting money to the ceiling
Difference 'tween us like at least a couple million
It's foreign cars, pretty girls everywhere you go
Yeah, I heard it 30 times on the radio
Louboutin ain't gon' pay you for that bragging
And Donatella prolly never heard yo' album
Yeah, they prolly 'bout to label me a hater
But I know these people greater than the songs they creating
It's little homies in the hood regurgitating
And everybody watching thinking that you made it
The truth is for a few designer labels and a little bit of paper now you 12 years slaving
Hey but you ain't Lupita, so why you beat up and pushing people to lean on a double cup and a seizure?
It sound like you put ya' feet up
You still a slave and money can't buy you freedom partna'

[Pre-Chorus: Dimitri McDowell]
Here we go again in circles
I think I heard it all
We been here before
But we need something more
Something more
Something more
What you say?
I can't hear 'cause you

[Chorus: Lecrae]
Ain't talk 'bout nuthin' (ain't talk 'bout nuthin')
Ain't talk 'bout nuthin' (ain't talk 'bout nuthin')
Ain't talk 'bout nuthin' (ain't talk 'bout nuthin')
Ain't talk 'bout nuthin' (ain't talk 'bout nuthin')
What you talking 'bout?
They be talking 'bout the same ol' thing
I'ma have to call a foul in the game
What you talking 'bout?
A little money now you all OG
Talking 'bout it's all eyes on me
They ain't talking 'bout nuthin'

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Aye, tell me why the song's on in my car (hear the radio)
Why the song on in my gym (what they saying now?)
Man, the song stuck in my head (I can't take no more)
I still don't know what y'all saying
Lemme, lemme, lemme do this
I'ma be a straight shooter
Aye, we was made in His image, why we so Judas?
Talking bread like we at the last supper
Throwing money at these women, make it rain in the summer
I ain't advertising brands on the radio
They expensive and I know they ain't gon' pay me for it
Telling kids to go in debt for the 'vette that they'll prolly never get, but I talk about it every song
In every song talking 'bout they selling work on every corner
Don't talk about the laws, taking kids away from mommas
Don't talk about ya' homie in the trauma 'cause he shot up
Or what about ya' young boy messing up the product?
They don't talk about the bond money that they ain't have
And e'rybody snitch on e'rybody in the jam
They don't talk about the pain, they don't talk about the struggle
How they turn to the Lord when they ran into trouble
I'ma talk about it
I don't care if the world try to swallow me
I turn my back to 'em, tell 'em all "follow me"
I know you gon' label me a hater
But inside you are greater than the songs you creating, man

[Pre-Chorus: Dimitri McDowell]
Here we go again in circles
I think I heard it all
We been here before
But we need something more
Something more
Something more
What you say?
I can't hear 'cause you

[Chorus: Lecrae]
Ain't talk 'bout nuthin' (ain't talk 'bout nuthin')
Ain't talk 'bout nuthin' (ain't talk 'bout nuthin')
Ain't talk 'bout nuthin' (ain't talk 'bout nuthin')
Ain't talk 'bout nuthin' (ain't talk 'bout nuthin')
What you talking 'bout?
They be talking 'bout the same ol' thing
I'ma have to call a foul in the game
What you talking 'bout?
A little money now you all OG
Talking 'bout it's all eyes on me
They ain't talking 'bout nuthin'

A little money now you all OG
Talking 'bout it's all eyes on me
They ain't talking 'bout nuthin'

[Outro]
Hey man, the way I see it, I think we were made for more than just, you know, the simple things that we, uh, aspire toward. We were made for more than just telling stories of, you know, how much money we can get from selling poison to people. It's time to talk about who we are and who we can be. Man, we need to build each other up, not put each other down. I feel like we not talking about nuthin' right now
