[Verse 1: Wordsplayed]
Redenbacher on an poppin'
Andy passin', call that Stockton
All a sudden labels jockin'
Askin' for another option
Coppers ask'n why Iâ€™m speed'n
Miner League, Major Deegan
Try and take him to the precinct
Lawyer said you need a reason
Spot the kid on Spotify
See the numbers, they don't lie
Yellow birdie in the logo
We on two plus the ocho
High stakes and my funds low
Honeymoon in the bungalow
No shirt, it's the gun show
Man I'm flexing on my exes
I'm in the pocket like Brady
Magic and Bird like the 80's (swish)
Startin' but don't try to play me
Then I might ghost like I'm Swayze
Two tone in the Patigon', that's peach and Navy
Hasselhof in the slowmo, that's extra wavy
And I wrist, wrist, wrist
I know there's opposition, but it's swish, swish, swish
I know you seen 'em do it, but not like this
Money make you or it break you
Take the game before it take you lo-fi

[Hook: Wordsplayed & Andy Mineo]
I do it for the kids
Young man, always
Surfin', no waves
I do it for the kids
It's all for the youngins
Young man, always
Surfing, no waves
I do it for the kids
They want to know who I do it for
I do it all
I do it for the kids
They want to know who I do it for
I do it all
I do it for the kids

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
This right here for the kids
Yeah I know what they want
I'ma give 'em what they need
Yeah, I been real from the jump
I don't like fake 'round me
Throw deuce like Kyrie
One girl, no sidepiece
I call that fine by me
Livin' like I'm never gon' die
Hate you man, I know they gon' try
You don't ever pay them no mind
If you did they have a gold mine
If you like what you like
Then you don't need no co-sign
Know business, this show business
Stay on demand and it's showtime
I'm in the pocket like Brady
Magic and Bird like the 80's
Kobe, I might put up eighty
Look only Jesus can save me
I know the way, I know the way
Look, ain't nothin' to say to me
I'm 'bout to break, I'm 'bout to break
Uh, somebody come pray for me
I got this great in me
I got to get it cause that's what I'm made to be
I cannot focus man I got the A.D.D
I'm gettin' bigger, just look how she plated me
Don't get lost in the sauce
Take that from a veteran (preach)
Like a adobo in a Spanish home, it's on everything

[Bridge]
All praise to the Father
And the Son, and the Holy Ghost

[Hook: Wordsplayed & Andy Mineo]
Young man, always
Surfin', no waves
I do it for the kids
It's all for the youngins
Young man, always
Surfin', no waves
I do it for the kids
They want to know who I do it for
I do it all
I do it for the kids
They want to know who I do it for
I do it all
I do it for the kids
