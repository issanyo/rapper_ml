[Intro: Cap-1]
Them streets don't love you, man, the streets don't love you
Them streets don't love you, man, the streets don't love you
Them streets don't love you, man, the streets don't love you
Man, the streets don't love you, the streets don't love you
Look

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Streets don't love you, I already knew that
But some of us the streets all we ever had
The streets was the place that I learned to be a man
Ain't play no guitars but they all about the bands
Ooh, man
The streets don't love you like this
And everybody cool gettin' money but they singin' like Fetty whenever they get pinched
Like yeah, baby
It got all bad baby
Makin' money fast baby
But it don't last baby
Dang, let me chill
Man, I'm wylin', but you know that joint true
When that woop-woop pull through they gon' blame it on you
By the time you get out you prolly gonna be 40
And your mans at your crib givin' eeh to your shawty like, uh
I feel oughta keep it real
He ain't wrote one letter, you took the L
So what's that spell? Loud and clear
The streets don't love you, the streets don't love you!

[Hook: Cap-1]
Them streets don't love you, man, the streets don't love you
Them streets don't love you, man, the streets don't love you
Them streets don't love you, man, the streets don't love you
Man, the streets don't love you, man, the streets don't love you

[Verse 2: Clemm Rishad]
God on my side, now the world on my shoulder
Nice with the pen like professional bowler
Streets do not love you, you learn when you older
If haters contagious they sickest ebola
Here's the thing, I wanted more O's than Oprah
Now I just chill and let God be my chauffer
Whippin', whippin', past my competition and them non-believers
Hope they see the vision
Open your eyes up, stop eatin' them lies up
Maybe one day you rise up
I'm a rap star like Fern cover, watch them line up
Clemm Rishad on that remix, boy
You know it's hotter than Phoenix, boy
Blessed up, my chest up
Get a quick stretch cause I'm next up
Prayin' more than Tebow, I told the TV free the people
I told my necklace feed my ego
I told rap to free my heroes
I know they want me hurt, D. Rose
See the envy all in your soul
When you make it to the top it's only one thing that I know, know
Clint

[Hook: Cap-1]
Them streets don't love you, man, the streets don't love you
Them streets don't love you, man, the streets don't love you
Them streets don't love you, man, the streets don't love you
Man, the streets don't love you, man, the streets don't love you

[Verse 3: Fern]
I got to say thank you, I'm so thankful
Remix for the people, God bless you
Andy Mineo and Clemm Rishad to make it special
That's how much it means to me, you rock with what I meant to Trust me, I mean next time we gon' break some threshold
And we used to the fact we kill it from the get go
3 years into it, they wonder what's my next move
Let's go, fourth and out, we on the next flow
Lentos siguen atras mira el ejemplo
La calle no te ama, lo que yo digo en el templo
Solamente estoy tratando de salvarte del infierno
Coje el momento y aprende del Maestro
Back to it, potent like crack fluid
They tellin' me, "Fern spit powerful soul music"
Never hold back, when I spit it I go through it
In the zone when I ?, I know that you gon' use it
Came to the realization, my music is therapeutic
And Jesus my medicine, why I use Him all in my music
The Father told me, "As long as me you're pursuin'"
He workin' out for my good and that Social Club is the movement
You know

[Outro: Marty]
You know I had to get on the track and talk my talk. Right now we havin' a international potluck. I got Sicilians, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Mexicanos. You already know, it's too much, it's international over here. 68 & Douglas, social season, I told you. Marty for President, don't act like you don't know. Woohoo!
