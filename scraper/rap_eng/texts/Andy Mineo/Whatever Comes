[Hook]
Whatever comes, whatever go
The Lord's teaching me He's in control
And if I never had anything more
Well at least I got Him yo He saved my soul, that's on
Hey, whatever comes, whatever go
The Lord's teaching me He's in control
And if I never had anything more
Well at least I got Him yo He saved my soul

[Verse 1]
Man I can't choose I like the new school and the boom-bapping
Most of these dudes are cartoon rapping, they super goofy
Say you shooting when you did a movie, stop lying
You know you searching for acceptance homie stop trying
Rest in the fact that you are, but let me define it
Sometimes, we sitting right in front of treasure that we can't find
And truth is deadly if it's learned and not applied
Everything that happened in your life, yeah God designed
And He's fully aware
With you even when you in that student affair office tryna choose a career
You might look at the cards you dealt and say that it ain't fair
But be careful, in our struggles that's when God is most near
What a blessing, the mysteries of God are so interesting
Like how I got free will but still pre-destined
The Spirit that fills me, it resurrected Jesus
We looking death in the eye, like yo you can't defeat us
So I tell 'em

[Hook]
Whatever comes, whatever go
The Lord's teaching me He's in control
And if I never had anything more
Well at least I got Him yo He saved my soul, that's on
Hey, whatever comes, whatever go
The Lord's teaching me He's in control
And if I never had anything more
Well at least I got Him yo He saved my soul

[Verse 2]
I wrote this on Good Friday, but why they call it good?
An innocent man was beaten and nailed into wood
It's only through the lens of grace we see who that really should of been
Hanging from that tree, who the nails should have been put in...me
The only place the world has ever seen complete justice, grace and love meet
The innocent one took the blame so I wouldn't have to
This is good unless you don't believe the bad news
For the sin you committed just in the last two minutes
You deserve God's holy and just wrath dude
So let me ask you
You ever regret something like a tattoo of the name of your last boo?
Sin is so deep, all up in your skin
Like the sin that you try to delete
Cry and you weep
But unless the Christ died and He rise to His feet and ascended into the sky then our hope is obsolete
So I tell 'em

[Hook]
Whatever comes, whatever go
The Lord's teaching me He's in control
And if I never had anything more
Well at least I got Him yo He saved my soul, that's on
Hey, whatever comes, whatever go
The Lord's teaching me He's in control
And if I never had anything more
Well at least I got Him yo He saved my soul

[Outro]
(Burp)
