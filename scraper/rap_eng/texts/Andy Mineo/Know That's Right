[Intro: Andy Mineo]
If you stay ready
You ain't gotta get ready
All ready
Yeah, y'all ready?
Look, if you stay ready
You ain't gotta get ready
All ready
Look, y'all ready, I'm ready, y'all ready

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
I, I go for that, I get it
Came in this game, me and 'Crae on a mission
At Fountainebleau, that's Club Liv
But I ain't see too many of y'all livin'
Seem like everybody tryna fit in
Livin' that life like a highlight reel
That ain't real
They ain't tell you 'bout the sweat they spilled
How they got no chill just to get it
I'm livin' the high life (never land)
High art for the Most High
My wife in them high heels
Ooh, high five!
That's nice
You know, you know that's right
And I don't got fans, I got family
I'm on my Chief Keef, y'all don't understand me, squad!

[Pre-Hook: Andy Mineo & Eris Ford]
There's nothin' left to say
I know where I'm goin'
We're startin' here today
And you know, you know that's right

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
You, you know
You know that's right
You, you know
You know that's right
You, you know
You know that's right
You, you know
You know that's right

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
My Savior is Jewish, my lawyer is Jewish
My stomach is Buddhist
I'm trying to lose it, but I need to chill on Fig Newtons, I swear
I don't sweat the money, only the music
Now I got the juice, and my words got influence
That's power to use it and I don't wanna blow it
First off, rap lied to us
Y'all ain't figured that yet?
They got the whole world tryna ball out
How you ball so hard but you still got debt?
I don't respect anybody that's trying to flex
Y'all lookin' the weakest
'Cause I was with a billionaire last week and the boy had Payless sneakers on (get money)
My homegirl started strippin'
I said, "Chill, get your degree"
She told me, "Andy you trippin', 'cause you don't make more money than me"
Well, you know that's right
But some money always come with a price
I love this life, but I'm sure what I got next, to die for

[Pre-Hook: Andy Mineo & Eris Ford]
There's nothin' left to say
I know where I'm goin'
We're startin' here today
And you know, you know that's right

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
You, you know
You know that's right
You, you know
You know that's right
You, you know
You know that's right
You, you know
You know that's right

[Bridge: Andy Mineo]
You know that's right
You know that's right
You know that's right
You know that's right

[Outro: Andy Mineo]
There's nothin' left to say
(If you stay ready you ain't gotta get ready)
I know where I'm goin'
(All ready look, y'all ready, I'm ready y'all ready)
There's nothin' left to say
(If you stay ready you ain't gotta get ready)
I know where I'm goin'
(All ready, look
Y'all ready, I'm ready, y'all ready)
Nothin' left to say
I know where I'm goin'
I'm goin', I'm goin' home
