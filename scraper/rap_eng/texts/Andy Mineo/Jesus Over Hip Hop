[Intro: Wordsplayed]
Jesus over hip-hop

[Hook: Wordsplayed & Andy Mineo] (x2)
He died, hit the grave and that's why we praise Him
Jesus over hip-hop
That's the equation
Author of salvation, blood make us blameless
Jesus over hip-hop
That's the equation

[Verse 1]
I used to be the MC that was battlin'
Tearin' 'em other rappers down so I could take the cash and win
Now I battle sin
My greatest passion is to point the masses to the cross
Where He had to get the wrath of Almighty God poured on His back
With the lashes of forty all
For the sake of man became  cursed on a tree
Took replacement of my works so through faith I could be free
I'm praisin' Him frequently, speakin' these ? teachers to people please
See ministry over beats and ninety cycle frequencies
Speakin' the universal language of music could reach the streets
Preachin' Jesus the only reason I plead and peep these deeds
You can cop that line up and chop them rhymes up
But stop if your walk ain't line up
That's why I put the rock in the center, only rock for a splendor
Pray and watch, I got to remember

[Hook] (x2)
He died, hit the grave and that's why we praise Him
Jesus over hip-hop
That's the equation
Author of salvation, blood make us blameless
Jesus over hip-hop
That's the equation

[Verse 2]
Everybody wanna flow, be a Christian rapper
Get off the stage, don't wanna be a Christian after
Wanna get they records mixed and mastered
Rock stages, the same
Maybe don't flip the pages of Scripture after, nah
That's twisted backwards like (reversed audio)
And they never be comin' around but wanna be pastors, why?
James tells not all should be teachers
Cause we're judged more harshly, now peep this
You teachin' everytime your starin' through them speakers
So why be worried 'bout ? through Jesus more than carin' 'bout sneakers
I wanna see affections for the ressurected Lord
And not just in the record stores
And the reason why I'm pressin' y'all is so we don't make idols out our craft
That's the lesson y'all
Cause we see the beats and rhymes work
But the Bible says go and make disciples
Don't just meet up at a concert

[Hook] (x2)
He died, hit the grave and that's why we praise Him
Jesus over hip-hop
That's the equation
Author of salvation, blood make us blameless
Jesus over hip-hop
That's the equation

[Verse 3]
I love the cardboard, the break beats, the rappin' and graffiti
But that shouldn't be the only reason why we meet
If we stay there we all milk what we need, need
Prayer and Bible study, accountability weekly
And there ain't nothin' wrong with havin' a passion for rappin'
As long as it ain't surpassin' El Shaddai
I see so many make a pen and paper their savior
And then they don't find peace in the storm and wonder why, man
I wanna see abandonment to Christ
Takin' our hearts and examinin' them under the light
Peepin' the motives that control us, cause if we lose focus of the cross
We're hopeless, ministry starts chokin' us
I'm so broken cause, I fear that you don't know
Ministry doens't measure your spiritual growth
If you're Christians, where does Christ rank?
That's why it's Jesus over, well, you fill in the blank
