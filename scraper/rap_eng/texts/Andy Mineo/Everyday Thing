[Intro]
This ain't a Sunday thing, a once in a while thing, maybe if my emotions get high enough thing, it's
Everyday thing

[Verse 1]
God don't owe me anything, I owe Him everything
They try to put Him in a box like a wedding ring
He came out, oh dear no venison
Our sin is disease, Jesus is still the medicine
Woo!
That's why these bars hard to explain
So I calculate my rhymes, sorta like a chess game
I'm tryna balance all my art and theology
So when it comes out of me, I represent properly
Three persons, one God,no apostrophe S's
Progressing with caution, slow talking
Quick to listen, with sick precision Jesus fix my vision
Man I don't care if you Christian, you're wack with what you're spitting
I ain't writing you no mediocre pass, pimping
This is art it don't have a religion
They try to pigeon-hole me, say I'm too holy to show face
I don't come around cause y'all just wanna see my old ways
I'm on a new path, I'm chucking up the peace sign
They throw it back without the index
What could I expect?
Hate my master, then they gon' hate me too
Wish death upon me, well I'm just praying for you
And uh...

[Hook] (x2)
Hey, we walk it out, we getting it
Ain't no days off, man we living it
Everyday thing, every-everyday thing
Yo it's a everyday, thing
Everyday thing

[Verse 2]
I'm tryna die hard, I Bruce Willis on 'em
Got living waters like rivers, so I fill up on 'em
Ladies go to the club, let dudes feel up on 'em
You do that anywhere else and that's a real problem
They violating they own codes of ethics
I'm leaving the studio, while you're fixing your breakfast
Then I wakes and read the texts, you know
Spurgeon, Oswald, and both testaments
I'm feeling excellent, came home from Cali
Where I hit a BMW and even left a dent
It kept from a show out in San Diego
But God knows it coulda been worse, so I'm grateful
I escaped without injury, missing a few pesos
There goes what I just made at my show, shoot
But with the Savior I got favor like playing rock, paper
With Edward Scissorhands, man I could never lose
I'm winning, he won one in the beginning, God
Stopped the sentence, isn't it so evident
It's all about him from the first verse of Genesis
He the beginning and the end and the present tense

[Hook]
