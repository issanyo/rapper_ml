[Verse 1]
It was just last week that my grandma died
It's been years since I've seen family on my father's side
A bittersweet moment but tell me why
Nothing less than the sting of death brought us together
I sat and listened to the priest tell lies
To appease loved ones in they seats
When you're looking at a face that's weeping
The grim truth don't bring 'em no peace
So I put on all white gloves like Mr. Jackson
Carry the casket to the Cadillac then
I realize this is the first time that me and my brothers ever did something together
Whatever, I'm grown now, come on, let's just put on our smiles and take pictures, we can take pictures
Eat this humble pie and leave them dishes
For somebody else to clean 'em until I see ya'll again

[Pre-Hook]
(Breaking down, breaking down)
Everything here is breaking down
(Br-br-Breaking down, breaking down)
It's all breaking down down down
(Breaking down, breaking down)
Everything here is breaking down
(Breaking down, breaking down)
But this won't be forever no

[Hook]
You used to make me cry
But one day he'll wipe every tear from our eyes
He'll come make all things right
And we'll sing death has died, but until that day

[Interlude]
Until that day
Oh, until that day
Oh, oh, oh
This won't be forever
Until that day
Oh, until that day
Oh (this won't be forever)
This won't be forever

[Verse 2]
I hopped off the plane
My God, what a scene that I seen on that TV screen
People huddled round, hands on they mouth
Not again, same problem, it hit a new town
Twenty-six dead, twenty of 'em kids
Where do you begin when some lives just ended
And everybody got the question
"If God's so good, how he let this happen?"
Is it mental health? Is it gun control?
Is it we make superstars out of animals?
Is it the movies we make? The video games?
I don't know, but God I want an antidote
All I know is this world is broken
Our sin is the reason it ain't like it's supposed to
Words fall short tryna comfort the grieving
But you gotta know that there's hope to believe in
One day my God gon' crack the sky
He gon' bottle up every tear that we ever cry
Bring truth to every lie, justice for every crime
All our shame will be gone and we'll never have to hide
No more broken hearts, no more broken homes
No more locking doors, no more cops patrolling
No abusive words, or abusive touches
No more cancerous cells that'll take our loved ones
No more hungry kids, no more natural disasters
No child will ever have to ask where his dad is
No funerals, where we wear all black
And death will be dead, then we'll lock the casket, yes

[Hook x2]
