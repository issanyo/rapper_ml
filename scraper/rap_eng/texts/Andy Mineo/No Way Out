[Intro]
It's Track or Die

[Verse 1]
This is what you need to know
Go for great, never settle for that mediocre
If I don't do it right I won't do it
Why you think you waiting for the music, huh?
Well this right here take time
I gotta come right every time
If you wanna hate, I ain't hatin', that's fine
Go and get a number, join the back of the line, alright now?
It's wrapped around the buildin'
Even under heat I'm chillin', well
Why they don't want the Bible in the school?
Why they want the Bible in prison, well
What, y'all ain't seen that comin'?
Look, all I really know is one hundred, yeah
I seen a couple people get they money right
Now it's like you can't tell me nothin'
I might run up on the Sway show
And I might hit the stunt button, aow!
That's for all you rappers who ain't talkin' about nothin', nope
You see, the money don't change people
I know you thought that it does
But give a broke man bread and you see who they always was
Nah mean?

[Hook]
No way out, ain't no easy way out
There's no way out, ain't no easy way out
No way out, ain't no easy way out
No there ain't not easy way out now

[Verse 2]
I'ma put it to you straight
Everyday I wake up off top, I go pray
Then I thank God that I made it
Best part is that I did it His way
I see y'all gettin' cray on the social
But that ain't really you, little homie I know you
So when you done tryna live for a world that don't care about your soul
Best bet you could roll through
It's all love, all love man
I only want the best for 'em so I check for 'em
If they money messed up man, I even got a check for 'em
Invest in 'em, I bless 'em
And you ain't gotta pay back
Look, I deserve death, man, I never had to pay for that
On a track I give any rapper that you know a run for they money
God forbid I'm ever chasin' that
Young boy from the East coast
Goin' beast mode every time I get a beat though
How you tryna start with me? You ain't even off the sea
It's a legendary moment like it's Jordan from the free throw, bang!
Life, no one survives it
Gram's in the kitchen, she whippin' that pasta
She told me, "Mangia, eat up"
I'm just eatin' up, get the sweet potato
White boy got soul, that's Anita Baker
Lately we been on a roll, I don't mean a baker
You should check for us, man, I don't need a waiter
You ain't from Atlanta so please don't get brave
These internet thugs got opinions
But then when I see 'em it's love
You know what I'm thinkin'? You should've kept thinkin'

[Hook]
No way out, ain't no easy way out
There's no way out, ain't no easy way out
No way out ain't no easy way out
No there ain't not easy way out now
