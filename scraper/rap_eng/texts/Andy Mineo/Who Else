Friends and the family
Do it for the friends and the family
Friends and the family
Do it for the friends and the family
Who else?
Friends and the family
Do it for the friends and the family
Friends and the family
If you don't know them, you don't know me man
Friends and the family
Do it for the friends and the family, aye!
Friends and the family
Do it for the friends and the family
Who else?
Friends and the family
Do it for the friends and the family
Friends and the family
If you don't know them, you don't know me man

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Load up the bus
Man, 'bout to go on tour again
Rollin' out with these hooligans
Listen man, all we do is win, ooh!
'Bout to make chubby fellas cool again
That ain't happen since Escobar
It's friends and family, who the rest of y'all?
My God
Misfits, unashamed
Man, that's the campaign
Man, I been shinin' way before I had a chain
Still don't got one, what the heck am I sayin'?
Ever since I met God, man, never been the same
Now I got the big picture into my frame
And I came up in the game
But I remained me, the same
Cause I kept the letter "E" out of the word "fame" that's "fam"

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Friends and the family
Do it for the friends and the family
Friends and the family
Do it for the friends and the family
Who else?
Friends and the family
Do it for the friends and the family
Friends and the family
If you don't know them, you don't know me man
Friends and the family
Do it for the friends of the family, aye!
Friends and the family
Do it for the friends and the family
Who else?
Friends and the family
Do it for the friends and the family
Friends and the family
If you don't know them, you don't know me man

[Break 1: Marty]
You look like a Men In Black alien trying to blend in on Earth. Stop talking

[Verse 2: Marty]
I feel like a young Fonzarelli
Racin' Khaled on a jet ski
Only if my wifey let's me
Aye guys, she's cool, we're good
This is for the friends and family
They don't what we been doing, wow
Planning a family reunion, everything booming
Hop out the bus in the Ewings
Come to your door like I'm Newman
Putting my life in this music
My God in this music, my heart in this music
What else are we doing?
This is that pure, no substitution
I'm not the man, I'm a human
This for the fans of the movement

[Verse 3: Fern]
For the friends and the family
Who know that we're doing this more than just rapping
We're back on road, 'bout to pull up
Tour bus, parking in the lot
What's happening?
Jordan 4’s and the Pure Boost, long tee with the hoodie on
That's fashion (yes it is)
When you see me on stage, that's passion
For the God who allows what I'm rapping
Y'all soothsayers, we truth tellers, we good fellas
Our band of brothers, got the gang smothered
So we hit the road, switching lanes over
This game over
And we ride 'til He say, "Over"
Rap game, here's your makeover
Still three amigos when the day's over, Fern

[Break 2: Andy Mineo]
It’s very simple. Here’s a couple things that I would do. One, you should never go outside without a helmet. And you never disrespect my friends or my family

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
If you don't know them, you don't know me man
Friends and the family
Do it for the friends and the family
Friends and the family
Do it for the friends and the family
Who else?
Friends and the family
Do it for the friends and the family
Friends and the family
If you don't know them, you don't know me man

[Outro: Andy Mineo]
If you don't know them you don't know me, nope
