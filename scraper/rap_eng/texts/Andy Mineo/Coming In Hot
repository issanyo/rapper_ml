[Chorus: Andy Mineo]
I don't do the most but I do a lot
I'ma make a toast 'cause we still alive
No Big, I feel like Pac
I shoot the shot (Brap, brap, brap)
I'm coming in hot! (Hot hot hot, ooh)
Coming in hot! (SAK PASE)
Shoot that! (Shoot that shot)
Ayy, why not! (Ayy why not!)

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Yeah, coming in hot! (Coming in hot)
Just like the fajita (Like the fajita)
I write what I live (Write what I live)
My life in the speaker (Life in the speakers)
I'm nice with the flow (Nice with the)
Just like the demeanor (Like the demeanor)
I'm feeding my fam (Feeding my fam)
I'm feeding the meter, unh
They got the iron while I got the steamer
I bring the fire, but you never seen her
I testify, don't need a subpoena
They want my soul, better go to Korea
I love my dog, just like I'm PETA
Gotta protect Him, I made the call up just like I'm reppin'
I know we left yeah, now we back together
But I guess that it's Better now Later Than Never, like unh
What's happenin'!
I'ma need y'all to quit askin' when
Me and my wife gon' have some kids
Right now we just practicin'
(Whoo! Whoo!) Practicin'!
Teacher said quit rappin', man
That gon' hurt my average
I said, "Thank God I ain't average!"
Yeah, I'm a bright young man (Bright young man)
Kill the GPA (GPA)
And the BPM (BPM)
Look, we on (Ten!)
So say what you say
'Cause that's A with Lecrae
From the A-Train to the A
I'm coming in hot!

[Chorus: Andy Mineo]
I don't do the most but I do a lot
I'ma make a toast 'cause we still alive
No Big, I feel like Pac
I shoot the shot (Brap, brap, brap)
I'm coming in hot!
Coming in!
Shoot that! (Shot! Woah, woah)
Ayy why not! (Ayy why not, ayy, yup)
I'm coming in-

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Wake 'em up! Wake 'em up!
Wake 'em up! Wake 'em up!
See 'em still sleepin', so I had to shake 'em up (Shake 'em up)
I kept it too real (Yo)
I wasn't fake enough (No)
My real life was a headline (Headline)
Yo' real life got a deadline (Deadline)
My timeline was a hashtag (Yikes)
Your timeline just a hate crime
Coming in hot (Yah), feelin' like Pac (Yah)
Back in '94, when he took 5 shots (Pop, pop)
Too much drive to ride yo' wave
Ditch my top then I'm off that lot (Skrrrrrt)
Black on black on black on black on black on black on black
(Black, black, black, black, black)
You don't have to ball or rap to get them racks on racks (No)
Uber poolers tryna catch my vibe and find my way (Yuh, yuh)
Yeah, I know I know I'm rachet but I'm really saved
Hot sauce drippin' (Drip)
Everybody wanna start dippin' (Dip)
First, nobody wanna listen (Shh)
Now everybody pay attention (Huh!)
Now everybody pay a fee (Ching!)
Even Trump gotta take a knee (Sheesh)
When the horn blow y'all gon' see
Make the wall fall down like yee!

[Chorus: Lecrae & Andy Mineo]
I don't do the most but I do a lot (Do it!)
I'ma make a toast 'cause we still alive (Wassup)
No Big (Nah!), I feel like Pac (Pac!)
I shoot the shot (Brap, brap, brap)
I'm coming in hot!
Coming in hot!, Coming in hot!
Shoot that shot!, Shoot that shot!
Shoot, why not?! Ayy why not!
Ain't no Big! (Ain't no Big!) feel like Pac (Feelin' like Pac)
We can't lose, we can't stop! (We can't stop)
Yeah, coming in hot!
Coming in hot! Coming in hot! (Hot!)
Shoot that shoot! Ayy why not!
Ayy why not! Ayy watch out!
I'm coming in hot
