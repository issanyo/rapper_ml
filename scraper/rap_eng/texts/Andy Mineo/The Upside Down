[Verse]
This is all out of my control, really
I got one job, make the flow silly
Serve one God, it's my sole mission
When I'm out of here, man, I won't miss it
How that man went and sold fifty?
Not one blogger even noticed him
But they don't diss them, they just don't listen
Oh I get it, they don't get it
At the shows some blow sticky
Some ladies even throw Vickie's
But he stay pure, that's so Disney
Shout Soulection, my bro's in it
Out the rappers in this whole city
Not one of y'all was ever gon' pick me
So I picked the locks then came through the back doors
Sold out shows and still got my soul with me, woo!
Stranger things have happened
And a white boy like me blackin'
On a track I'm going bad again
Got a baddie and she going Randy Savage (oh, yeah!)
All I know is that family matters
All I know when I came in rappin'
If you jack somebody else flow and style
Then you gon get a black eye like "Panda"
Put up or shut up, so what up, I'm here?
I don't got nothing to fear
I don't go one up my peers, I just been pushing myself
I don't like cussin', but this one I swear
When I start bustin' they shouldn't be near
They never been accustomed to hearin' this custom-made flow
They just copy the stuff that they hear
Man, they always come up short
I'm a sneaker connoisseur
I been readin' Art of War
Don't they see I got some more?
Nuke the beat up for your boy
I'ma need another four
Before I leave it at the morgue
Yeah, we winnin', but who keepin' score?
Woo!

[Outro]
I know stranger things have happened
Stranger things have happened
I know stranger things have happened
Stranger things have happened
I know, I know stranger things have happened
I know stranger things have happened
