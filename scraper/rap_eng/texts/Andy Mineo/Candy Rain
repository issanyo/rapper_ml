[Hook]
Girl, you're like candy coated rain
Drop, drop, drops
Candy coated rain
Drop, drop, drops, drops

[Bridge]
You make me feel like it's "Candy Rain" in '95
Inside my ride
Skrrt skrrt
Here we go
You make me feel like it's "Candy Rain" in '95
Inside my ride
Skrrt skrrt
Like, here we go

[Verse 1]
Remember back when we said we were friends?
Nobody believed us
They saw it 'fore we did
Do you remember back when
I would call to see you even though I know you busy?
You'd always say you were free
Do you remember back when
You said that we wouldn't happen cause you never been into rappers?
Ooh, that's when I knew I had to have you
Do you 'member back when we were playing with it then?
But now we so deep that I gotta learn to swim

[Hook]
Girl, you're like candy coated rain
Drop, drop, drops, yeah
Candy coated rain
Drop, drop, drops
Candy coated rain
Drop, drop, drop
You're like candy coated rain
Drop, drop, drops, drops

[Bridge]
You make me feel like it's "Candy Rain" in '95
Inside my ride
Skrrt skrrt
Here we go
You make me feel like it's "Candy Rain" in '95
Nostalgia
Inside my ride
Skrrt skrrt
Like, here we go

[Verse 2]
Thinkin' 'bout 'fore you said yes
Before we did the flowers and the dress
We would stay up all night
Talk so long, had to take an intermission just to find an outlet
Go bed at 4, woke up at 6
Wanna put the cream in the coffee I fixed
I'm thinkin' 'bout everything cool when love is brand new
Rather have no sleep than have no you
Ooh, it's kinda weird
How when you really, really, really care
You gotta act like you don't really care
I think rejection is our biggest fear
Scared of commitment, I couldn't make a decision
But that's when I brought it to prayer
God was like,"Yeah"
I was like,"Yeah?"
He was like, "Yeah, don't start actin' weird"
Listen, I made a checklist of all the things I like 'bout you
Girl, you had a light 'bout you
You emotionally healthy
Look, I checked through your IG page and you didn't have one selfie
Ooh, you mysterious
Girl, I like that
Got a bad body, never advertise that
Guess your confidence don't ever come from where them likes at
All my homies said, "Where you find that?"
I'm like, "Amen, I found it in church"
Why you still chasin' them shawties that twerk?
Man, that don't work
When I wrote that verse in "Curious"
You were the one who inspired it
Look at me now
You got this player to take off his jersey, retire it

[Hook]
Girl, you're like candy coated rain
Drop, drop, drops, yeah
Candy coated rain
Drop, drop, drops
Candy coated rain
Drop, drop, drop
You're like candy coated rain
Drop, drop, drops, drops

[Outro]
You make me feel like it's "Candy Rain" in '95
Inside my ride
Skrrt skrrt
Here we go
You make me feel like it's "Candy Rain" in '95
Inside my ride
Skrrt skrrt
Like, here we go
