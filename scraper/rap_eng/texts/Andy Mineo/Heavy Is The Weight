[Verse 1: Matty Mullins]
One step forward and two steps back
Nothing good ever comes easy
I gave it all and got a knife in my back
Should have known the ones I trusted would leave me
They only see what they wanna see

[Chorus: Matty Mullins]
Heavy is the weight that I hold
The weight that I hold
I carry it cause it's all that I know
This is all that I know
Pressure on me
Pressure to be
True to who I am
Heavy is the weight
The weight that I hold

[Verse 2: Matty Mullins]
One life, one chance, it's all I have
Wouldn't matter if the whole world hated me
So I move on, forget the past
And let 'em go back to thinkin' they made me
They only see what they want to see

[Chorus: Matty Mullins]
Heavy is the weight that I hold
The weight that I hold
I carry it cause it's all that I know
This is all that I know
Pressure on me
Pressure to be
True to who I am
Heavy is the weight
The weight that I hold

[Verse 3: Andy Mineo]
Heavy is the weight
I don't wanna wait
For them all to be good
When I wanna be great
Yeah, I know about pressure
Yeah, I know about stressin'
Worried if I'll lose everything invested
And I know about workin' when I'm hardly rested
Like, am I in tune with what I'm destined for?
Been carrying this weight for so long
Didn't even notice that my back was so strong
I can probably put a boat on it with no problem
The show must go on

[Chorus: Matty Mullins]
Heavy is the weight that I hold
The weight that I hold
I carry it cause it's all that I know
This is all that I know
Pressure on me
Pressure to be
True to who I am
Heavy is the weight
The weight that I hold

[Chorus: Matty Mullins]
Heavy is the weight that I hold (The weight that I hold)
The weight that I hold
I carry it cause it's all that I know (All that I know)
This is all that I know
Pressure on me
Pressure to be
True to who I am
Heavy is the weight (The weight)
Heavy is the weight
The weight that I hold
