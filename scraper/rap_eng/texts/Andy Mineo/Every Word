[Intro: Co Campbell] (x2)
I, voice

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
I never kept a diary
So when I die what's inside of me is on them MP3s
Well it'll probably be the closest thing to it, put it all in my music
The good, bad, ugly, Lord use it
I just want you to be glorified through it
Hope they don't confuse it, bein' a rapper's cool
But talkin' about the truth do nothin' 'til you pursue it
Want to know the fast track to look stupid?
Talk about obedience and never go do it
Lord I'm a hypocrite and I'm sick of it
I need your spirit to come help me live different
Got a certificate, graduated college
Learned a lot of stuff, that don't mean I got knowledge
Nah, less the fear of You end me
I'm so fallen but you the parachute with me

[Hook: Co Campbell] (x2)
I hear Your voice
But not always listening
I don't wanna live this way, no
I hear Your voice
But not always listening
I don't wanna live this way no more

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
It's easy to be Mister read-a-lot
Instead of just being Mister be-a-lot
Why do we define ourselves by what we are not?
Instead of who we are, we tell them where we stop
Puttin' on new, takin' off old
If you only take off you'll be waking up cold
I just wanna live bold, do what the text shows
Even if it means His will over my goals
Can't respond slow, gotta be immediate
There's places on the globe where people are so needy, it's appalling
Could've put off orphans in mattresses if I never put my feet in them maxes
Dang, this is all access
I need help, ain't too prideful to ask it
I ain't no Brett Favre, I need to practice
This track is still wack if I go backwards

[Hook]

[Bridge: Co Campbell & (Andy Mineo)]
Ho, hooh
Ho, hoo, hoh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
(I'm supposed to continue, right?)
Bah-bah, hoh, hooh
Bah-bah, hoh, hooh, ooh
Bah-bah, hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh
Bah-bah, hoh, hooh
Bah-bah, hoh, hooh
Bah-bah, hoh, hooh
I don't wanna live this way, no

[Hook]
