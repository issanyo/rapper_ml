Chorus (Mineo):
I don't do the most but I do a lot
I’ma make a toast 'cause we still alive
No Big, I feel like Pac
I shoot the shot
I'm coming in hot!
Coming in hot!
Shoot that!
Ayy, why not!

Verse 1 (DAX):
Coming in hot, coming in fuego
They ain’t no holes in my circle, no, this ain't a bagel
Jesus is God, I seen him at the stable, I'm coming in
Hot, I'm willing and able, Isaiah, so

Reach records, I eat records, I
Beat records, got heat decadence
Me back in this neat repping
Scolding 116 degrees, fellow

OG, I got the sauce
Not leaving y'all “Prego”
We building this tall
We linking on Lego, I'm coming in

Hot, sick, yes, I'm still coming in
Boss, sick, coming down with a cold
No, I'm not with the cold, way hotter than before
Eat this, no herbivore, sing it like “fígaro”

...don’t know you rappers, need
Pokedexes, y’all mumble fans like I
Hope he flexes, not throwing bands, I'm not
Throwing hands, I’m just torching Stan's, I'm like

...Bobby Shmurda in the
Summer sun, ATL up in the
101s, freshly made McDonalds Big Mac
Number one, boy, yo soy Cristiano, Native

North and flannel for the fit, fire
Spit fire, been fire
So much gospel, on my fifth choir
On a roll but never get tired (every)

Lines a gem, I'm spitting “rhymestones”
Doc, I’m stranger with the Time Stone
Solo Deo, not on my own, throw us
In the furnace, burning, earnest, we coming in (hot)

Chorus (Mineo):
I don't do the most but I do a lot
I'ma make a toast 'cause we still alive
No Big, I feel like Pac
I shoot the shot
I'm coming in hot!
Coming in!
Shoot that!
Ayy why not!
I'm coming in-

Verse 2 (Perry):
I been on the path since a pre-teen
Coming In hot like delivery
Got my game tight make it look so easy
When I'm in the city pull up when you see me

Boy I'm big dawg don't belittle me
Turned my life to a movie got the best view
And they got my back thru whatever
Only got real ones by my side that's the best crew

I don't know where I'd be without my day ones
My foundation still A-1
And the whole squad still on the move
G-O-D on my team really can't nun' phase us

Blessed up how can you blame us
Been free indeed they can't tame us
Had to let people go cuz the grind don't stop
So I know why they think I changed up

Homie all facts no cap I just wonna get my change up
Big boss ting get ya weight up
Even when I come down I stay up
Had to take a chance back then now I'm way up

They say where you been, I'm like I'll explain later
G-O-D paved the lane yes he a way maker
We pushing the culture forward tell em we some wave makers
You and your squad vs me and mines homie, you in grave danger

Chorus (Lecrae/Mineo):
I don't do the most but I do a lot
I'ma make a toast 'cause we still alive
No Big, I feel like Pac
I shoot the shot
I'm coming in hot!
Coming in hot!, Coming in hot!
Shoot that shot!, Shoot that shot!
Shoot, why not?! Ayy why not!
Ain't no Big! feel like Pac
We can't lose, we can't stop!
Yeah, coming in hot!
Coming in hot! Coming in hot!
Shoot that shoot! Ayy why not!
Ayy why not! Ayy watch out!
I'm coming in hot
