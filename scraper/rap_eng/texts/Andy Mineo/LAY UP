[Intro: Andy Mineo & Marv Albert (Wordsplayed)]
What time, is it?
Gametime
1.3 seconds left in regulation and right now you're not thinkin' jump shot, all you need is a layup
That's right Marv, nothin' fancy
No cosmetics
They've got a chance to win it here tonight at Dyckman courts. He throws it in, he's wide open
Don't miss, don't miss
(Ooh, he missed it at the horn)

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Wavin' my American flag
Even though it got "Made in China" on the tag
Used to have the GT with the mags now my face in the mags
I ain't gotta brag, momma said, “Let other people do that”
White man still can't jump
If I catch a fast break then I'm slappin' the glass
Ask my man Sequae, "Should I marry my girl"? He said, "Wait up, hold up
She fly, love God, and she got a good mind
Oh boy, that's a layup!"
Gotta take it when it come
Please don't miss it
What you bouta do with the rock?
When it’s game time for the wedding save me a ticket"

[Pre-Chorus: Andy Mineo]
What time is it? (front row)
Game time
What time is it?
Game time
What time is it?
Game time
Young boy, don't quit
One thing that you don't miss
That's a layup

[Chorus: Andy Mineo]
That's easy boy
That's a lay up
That's a free-bee boy (fundamentals)
That's a lay up
Don't blow it
That's a lay up
That's easy buckets (Eazy-E)
That's a lay up

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Told Alex I don't want no more trap beats
Man, why you had to send this?
You know I couldn't resist
This is a finger roll, look at the flicka da wrist
That's an assist, no I insist
Throw me the alley, I'll oop it
Spanish girl up in my hood
Look me in the face said, "Don't be estupid", I got it
Look, shawty I'm the professor, get the lab coat
I speak two languages, Spanglish and in vatos
Coach told me no lollygaggin'
Still dunk with my pants saggin'
One sixteen, yeah, it's tatted
Cause I been ridin', no bandwagon
Look, I done came down
Nate told me that's H-Town
But I'm Boeheim, when it's game time
That's a lay up, but I never lay it down
You ain't even pray for the dinner
How you got the prayin' hands on the 'gram for the picture?
Shots on Twitter they ain't nothing but net
And we already won, we don't care who got next

[Pre-Chorus: Andy Mineo]
What time is it?
Game time
What time is it?
Game time
What time is it?
Game time
Young boy, don't quit
One thing that you don't miss
That's a layup

[Chorus: Andy Mineo]
That's easy boy
That's a lay up
That's a free-bee boy (fundamentals)
That's a lay up
Don't blow it
That's a lay up
That's easy buckets (Eazy-E)
That's a lay up

[Verse 3: Wordsplayed]
Goin' down, NY
City don't sleep, let me close one eye
City don't weep, grown boys don't cry
Four wings with the pork fried, oh my
I'm schemin' up, teamin' up, lay it up
Screamin' out buckets, buckets
They don't even know me but swear that I did it for duckets, my Lord
We brought Sosa back to the minors
Lord help me, the money look major
She only love things that are finer
And she lookin' fine, boy, I tell you
That's two doors with the ceilin' gone
That's 5'4 with the silicone
I guess Mr. Right still choosin' wrong
Colored folks still can't swim
But Mike Phelps couldn't walk the water
Pastor said that we need Jesus
Big State was his alma mater
Di malo, shouts to Alex, that's my brother
Shoutin' Dyckman over Rucker
Look at grace, I think I love her

[Pre-Chorus: Andy Mineo]
What time is it?
Game time
What time is it?
Game time
What time is it?
Game time
Young boy, don't quit
One thing that you don't miss
That's a layup

[Chorus: Andy Mineo]
That's easy boy
That's a lay up
That's a free-bee boy (fundamentals)
That's a lay up
Don't blow it
That's a lay up
That's easy buckets (Eazy-E)
That's a lay up

[Outro: Andy Mineo & Marv Albert (Wordsplayed)]
Aw, you shoulda taken the stairs young fella
You can't win 'em all Marv
I can't believe he blew it
Unbelievable
That's a ball game here in New York
