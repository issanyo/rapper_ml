Intro:
This is my destiny/ Believing that I can be/ All that He wants of me/ I got it now

Verse 1:
I was too busy to see what was ahead of me ::Gotta put my focus right on you:: Forgetting to feed my soul with what I really need/ Failing to seek the face
Of my fatha ::Ooh ooh I’m running back to you:: He revealed my troubled heart to me ::yeah::

Vamp:
My work, my drive, my efforts to live/ My goals, my time, not mine it’s His ::Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah:: I’m a slave, surrendered to freedom/ Captured in
Christ, I Got it Now!

Hook:
This is my DESTINY/ Believing that I can be/ All that He wants of me/ I got it now!/ This is my DESTINY/ It’s not about me/ All for His Glory/ I got it now!

Verse 2:
More of me is fading as I pray/ Lookin more like Jesus
Is where i’m headed today/ Come come wit me if you wanna theres gonna be pain boy/But I know it’s leading me to joy ::uhoh:: His glory for my good/ It’s His story it’s understood/ It’s never been about me ::naw:: Lord i’m runnin towards you

Vamp:
My work, my drive, my efforts to live/ My goals, my time, not mine it’s His ::Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah:: I’m a slave, surrendered to freedom/ Captured in
Christ, I Got it Now!

Andy: ::Alright, ok ugh:: Ok I get it now/ Life ain't what it seems/ It ain't an ends in itself/ Broski it’s but a means/ Let me tell ya what I mean/ If you thinkin that it’s all about mwa/ Naw you sadly mistaken/ Let me tell ya why/ Cuz we born and then we die/ But i’ma live on so mama don’t cry/ Jesus came and conquered the grave/ So I know my place is up in the sky-y/ By
His blood we clean the failures of our past behind us/ No longer chasin dreams we seeds of promise ::yeah!::
