[Verse 1: Bizzy Crook]
Look, it’s the kid Bizzy Crook
Kid from Miami that's tryna win a Grammy, ya' heard?
305, we outchea
Westside, 239
Look, this here year been in the making
Varsity jacket at freshman orientation
I deserve an early graduation
To the underdog title with overly dedication
I hated holidays ‘cause of what my family would say though
But I still slid through to get a plate though
Sitting at the table like “Auntie, pass the potatoes”
She said “You should go to college, be more like your cousin Pedro”
But that was back in the day though
Now my payroll’s enough to put Pedro on payroll
This that next ish, James Bond cologne fresh ish
I’m just trying to find what’s really mine like a step kid
Ironically the woman I slept on I slept with
I pray they let Boosie go free like the death wish
I meant, Boosie free like the guest list
I pray they let Boosie go free like the guest list
‘Cause these rappers ain’t really hard
My homie busting credit cards, I can tell when somebody fraud
They say I sound Drake, I disagree
But ay I think your girlfriend great, she in the V
And by the way I parked her in the phantom across the street
And I treat her like the phantom, turn her on without the key
Me, I’m from the burbs but I do it for the slums
Flying women from my city to remember where I’m from
Brain like that, how you gonna tell her that she dumb?
See, I had an open crib so I try to make her cum

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Andy Mineo, 116, check
Rappers like some Jordans, they gave us the same thing
And still we went and bought ‘em
In this cold world, they looking so stunned, call ‘em Steve Austin
When they found out my clique sell tix, no Boston
Live shows awesome, 20’s all it cost ‘em
To watch ‘em go off and put microphones in the coffin
It’s awful, state of hip-hop was boys all in
Man it’s time to make your boys sit down like Stephen Hawking
We riding for the cause and we got no shame
Like Ricky Ross with his shirt off, huh!
No chains, just beads like it’s Mardi Gras
And they think I’m taking shots like I’m at the bar
Chirping like I locked the car alarm, nah
So I sound like that Jewish rapper, huh?, mazel tov
I don’t got writer’s block, the opposite problem
I don’t know when to stop so I just keep on jotting
Delilahs tryna pick my locks and get it poppin
The white boy nice, yeah he on his John Stockton
Stop it, talking at them shorties like he cool
I bet you don’t want your daughter to end up with some dude just like you
Uh, and rappers got a manhood problem, I swear
They just a bunch of grown boys with facial hair
Blaspheming God with the lungs that He gave oxygen
He will not be mocked, don’t you remember Sodom, man?
Back up and give me two feet like an ottoman
It’s obvious I’m out of your league like Jackie Robinson
Fake studio thugs been talking about their llamas
When the only eagle you seen throwing bullets was Donovan
Santo, Gloria, Dios is what I’m hollering
I’m uptown, Washington Heights, my fam palian yeah
Some rappers got a new god flow but my God reign forever
Go ahead and get your poncho
Money coming in so labels wanna advance us
You know what I tell ‘em yo? They ain’t got no chances
Thirty thousand in the first week, don’t understand us
You know what I tell ‘em Sway? They ain’t got the answers!

[Verse 3: 360]
Yo, I did more in two years than most dudes did in ten
I’m Apu in the booth, thank you, come again
Bada bing, bada boom, drop the beat, I’m going in
Fish scale in they pipe, fish scale in my pen
I done did a lot of dirt and never been to jail
I thank god but I don’t think he want me in his trails
If I don’t make it to Heaven, oh well
I’mma just be the hottest motherfucker in Hell
See, I rep that Queens, you rep your shook
You might slip, dodge these balls but catch this hook
You was breaking jaws, breaking laws but now I’m breaking records
Breaking yours, eating good but I’m taking seconds
Like extra, extra, read all about it, you can’t talk New York
And I’m not the topic, stop it, thinking you gon’ make a profit
That’s word to B-I, see I don’t see eye to eye with you
You fake, I’m true, those raps doo doo, you call, who knew?
Blood diamonds, suwoo, my pockets, puku, you girl plus me, choo choo
Mind right, money right, ready for whatever
Make green despite these niggas who’s jealous
Did it by myself, ain’t shit niggas could tell us
Outfit so fly, it should’ve came with propellers
My kind is becoming extinct, looking for the competition
But that cease to exist, don’t say I’m nice, just say I’m the shhh
Nice guys finish last except for Will Smith, like ay Queens

[Verse 4: Emilio Rojas]
Listen, Balenciaga boss, I ain’t gotta talk
Actions speak louder than words, that’s why you quiet for
You a rider, I know what you be riding on
You on borrowed time like the fab five in the final four
I am better than everybody that’s out
I can’t be the one leaving anybody with doubts
I ran the city with people that are clowns
All of my people, I keep ‘em around
All of my haters, I give ‘em a pound
‘Cause they sensitive, temperament, got me trying to censor this
In the middle of criminals hoping to get a legitimate business in
No minimum wage, nah they be giving them minimal sentences
If they gonna live in a cage, well then they family gonna live better ergh
My incentive is to keep my people wealthy
Eating, organic, I keep my people healthy
Leaking, Titanic, them freaky women love me
Find out I’m up in art galleries up in Chelsea
Ah, what the hell you mean I ain’t nice?
I’m lightning and striking twice, exciting as every vice
I got you begging me for your life
Until your knees looking like they from the Passion of the Christ, right?
Uptown, double bags, half price
The same damn block that them D’s pass by
Life a crap shoot, we rolling them stacked dice
I don’t need no last bar, we out
