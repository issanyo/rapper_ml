[Verse]
I'm probably the king of overthinkin'
Avoidin' pitfalls but it's always opportunities I'm missin'
Man, I'm scared to make a bad decision
'Cause you live with 'em, they eat your food, then leave you with the dishes
Man, we quick to talk, we ain't fast to listen
Jesus walked but He sat with sinners
So if you lost, ask for a visit
We bring our need and then He bring forgiveness
To give yourself away, that's the highest form of livin'
Listen, the other day, I ran into a fan
Gettin' a sonogram at the hospital I visit
Them tears were running down her face
She said, "I made a difference"
Found my music when she was battlin' with addiction
She ain't even religious
But what I said in some interviews had really got her thinkin'
That's when she introduced me to her husband
Now they first child comin', 'bout to start a family
Man, that's iller than a Grammy
Those are my trophies, when people in pain quote me
I live my life on purpose, you wouldn't believe the old me
I made a little money now, it's like they all know me
They got they hands out, they doin' the hokey pokey
I got a few fans who no longer support me
'Cause a quiet un-woke white folk is what I won't be
People killed like animals on video, they stay quiet
Animals killed on video, they start a riot
Must I remind you, Jesus was a dark-skinned man
Publically murdered, and He ain't never deserve it
The Pharisees sat by and watched while He hurtin'
That's why I see the Savior when I look at Mr. Sterling
Make America Great Again, I'm like, "Which version?"
We talkin' pre-slavery or post?
We talkin' 'bout before or after women could vote?
We talkin' about this land, before or after we stole it?
This isn't anti-patriotic, I'm just tellin' the truth
They wanna change the topic
Man, stop it
It's clear that we still got a problem
But until we admit our past
There's no way the future can have progress
And I'm just cleanin' out my closet
Gettin' rid of everything that's toxic
My train of thought, thanks for takin' a ride
Where do we go next, well, let's keep it a surprise
Like, uh
