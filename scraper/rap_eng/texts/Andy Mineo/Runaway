[Verse 1: Alex Faith]
Yeah
Beat like this got a man feeling like I'm making classics
Wife of my own when I ride so you know I got a bad chick
We live as kings like that's so far from your average
Then I hit the road and I take a trip with this bag is blasting
It's hard on us being gone for a minute
Though I struggle now I see the blessing in it
Looking forward but can't see the finish
And everybody can't let your boy stay winning
You got it twisted I tell you now
Feel when they come trying to take me down
So I'm pushing back and I believe the promise that The Lord always gonna hold me down

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
You can stay here, runaway
Flee from town, runaway
You can hold on, runaway
Stand your ground, runaway
If you don't take your chances there's no way you'll ever know
If you don't take your chances there's no way you'll ever know
(X2)

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Uh
I done found myself in the same position
Trying to pick a dame, but I can't playing games
Entertain different names, we exchanging digits
Uh, but you know what I'm thinking (what)
I've been over thinking this whole commitment thing
Dang I wish I didn't know the difference
Between a broken heart, and one sewn with stitches
Alright, don't sleep, don't sleep
Lately I've been feeling weak, so weak
Probably cause I've been gone week to week
Where me and God don't ever barely speak, don't speak
What happened, well, couldn't tell you but I'm trying to find out
Right now I feel like I'm in a hole and I'm trying to climb out

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
You can stay here, runaway
Flee from town, runaway
You can hold on, runaway
Stand your ground, runaway
If you don't take your chances there's no way you'll ever know
If you don't take your chances there's no way you'll ever know

[Verse 3: Alex faith]
Got a couple good things in my life right now
But I still got doubts
Saying in my heart
What if they find out that I'm not all that I'm cracked up to be
What if ATLast comes out and know one cares
Am I doing what I'm supposed to be
I love this life but will I sacrifice all that I have trying to make it here
Alright, tell me, tell me
What I gotta do to make myself believe
That I'm made for this
When I'm with the kings
That I have a place
I'm not chasing dreams
I got it twisted I tell you now
Fear shows up trying to hold me down
But I'm fighting back cause I know the promise that The Lord always gonna hold me, down

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
You can stay here, runaway
Flee from town, runaway
You can hold on, runaway
Stand your ground, runaway
If you don't take your chances there's no way you'll ever know
If you don't take your chances there's no way you'll ever know
