[Verse 1]
It was like a movie
When I first met you
The moment moved me
I still remember
Your soul of beauty
It stole me away, away

[Pre-Chorus]
Richer or poorer
Better or worse
Could we be together
Could we make it work
If love is patient
And if love is kind
Oh God, give me a sign

[Chorus]
You've got me thinking
This is love, this is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is love, this is love, this is love I believe it
I'll kiss you only
Darling, I promise
To hold you gently
And still be the strongest
I'm yours completely
No matter what comes our way
I'll love you 'til the end of my days
Til the end of my days

[Verse 2]
Could've never imagined
We'd find each other
A classic romantic
Of unlikely lovers
Some kind of magic
How two can turn into one, to one

[Pre-Chorus]
For rich or poor
Better or worse
We'll be together
Yeah, we'll make it work
Love is patient
I know love is kind
Thank God I saw the sign

[Chorus]
You've got me thinking
This is love, this is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is love, this is love, this is love I believe it
I'll kiss you only
Darling, I promise
To hold you gently
And still be the strongest
I'm yours completely
No matter what comes our way
I'll love you 'til the end of my days
Til the end of my days
Til the end of my days
Til the end of my days

[Bridge]
Run, run, run, run with me
As one, one, one, we will dream
Of a beautiful love mystery
So run, run, run, run with me

[Chorus]
This is love, this is love, this is love that I'm feeling
This is love, this is love, this is love I believe it
I'll kiss you only
Darling, I promise
To hold you gently
And still be the strongest
I'm yours completely
No matter what comes our way
I'll love you 'til the end of my days
Til the end of my days
Til the end of my days
Til the end of my days

[Outro]
Til the end of my days
Til the end of my days
Til the end of our days
I'll love you 'til the end of our days
Til the end of our days
