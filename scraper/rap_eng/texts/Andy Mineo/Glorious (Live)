[Verse 1: Luke]
Shepherds bowin' in the moonlight (Moonlight)
Angels dancing in the night sky
Can you believe it? (Can you believe it?)
Can you believe it? (Can you believe it?)

[Verse 2: Joel & Luke]
Mary smilin' at the manger (Manger)
Tears spillin' on a Saviour
Can you believe it?
Can you believe it?

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
For unto us a child is born

[Chorus: Joel & Luke, Joel, Luke]
He is the chorus to every song that we were born to sing
He is the rhythm of your heart so let the beat begin
He's so glorious
He is glorious (Ayy)
Glory, this is God with us
He is the miracle of the love that set the people free
He is the wonder of the world like we have never seen
He's so glorious
He is glorious (Yeah-ah)
Glory, this is God with us

[Verse 3: Joel & Luke]
We have been guarded by a baby
Every man and every lady
Can you believe it?
Can you believe it? (-lieve it, -lieve it)

[Chorus: Joel & Luke, Joel, Luke]
He is the chorus to every song that we were born to sing
He is the rhythm of your heart so let the beat begin
He's so Glorious
He is glorious (Ayy)
Glory, this is God with us
He is the miracle of the love that set the people free
He is the wonder of the world like we have never seen
He's so glorious
He is glorious (Ayy-ayy)
Glory, this is God with us

[Bridge]
(Yeah)
A wonder like we've never seen (Never seen, never seen)
A wonder like we've never seen (Never seen, never seen)
A wonder like we've never seen
Praise be to You only (Only, only)
A wonder like we've never seen
Greatest gift to you and me (You and me)

[Chorus: Joel & Luke, Joel, Luke]
He is the chorus to every song that we were born to sing
He is the rhythm of your heart so let the beat begin
He's so Glorious
(He is) Glorious (Ayy)
Glory, this is God with us
He is the miracle of the love that set the people free
He is the wonder of the world like we have never seen
He's so glorious
He is glorious (Ayy-ayy)
Glory, this is God with us
He's so glorious
He is glorious (Ayy-ayy)
Glory, this is God with us
Glo-ory, this is God with us
