[Coach Boomer (Andy Mineo)]
There's no room for giving up kids
When I was fourth string shot put at East Dakota community
No scholarship, you think I gave up?
No, I didn't
What about Disqus?
When I was tossin' the weighted frisbee
Also known as the Discus by Olympic qualifications
Do you think I was gonna give up because I couldn't throw 40 yards?
I practiced, harder every day
Until the sweat penetrated every ounce of cotton clothing I owned
Literally, no part of my body wasn't wet!
