[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I'm riding round and I’m getting’ it; they riding round pretendin’
I been had it, I been done, I promise that it's all empty
They say they ridin’ Bugatti's, man
Put some babies through college
Quit tryna’ act like the trap is cool
‘Cause we tired hearin’ that garbage
Hey, bags of white, pints of lean
I been on dope boys since a teen
But this ain't what we meant to be
And y'all don't make no sense to me
You pump fakin’, ain't shootin’, ain't killin, ain't doin’
Half them thangs you say you doin’, but 116 we stay true an’
Ain't dope dealin’, ain't Po pimpin’, talkin’ ‘bout my own folk killin’
We on that Jesus soul healin’, so serious, gorillas
Wild ain’t we, can't tame us, been changed, can’t change us
1:16 – You can’t shame us. Live that truth; you can't blame us

[Hook]
I heard him say he bought the block (Fakin!)
In his song he say he gansta’ but he not (Fakin!)
Say he makin’ money, cashin’ big checks (Fakin!)
While his chain leavin’ green on his neck (Fakin!)
I’m not impressed

So I guess that make you, yes that make you
That make you a faker!(x4)

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
If you catch me in a bar where the wild things are
With my pastor and an entourage who loves God
Please don't think that it's odd, we kick it 'round broken hearts
Fishing for men, surrounded by sin but ain't taking part
I talk about Jesus, all the Christians love me
I walk like Jesus now they wanna judge me, ain't it funny?
I'm duckin' stones thrown from the Pharisees
Gospel of peace up on my feet like a pair of cleats
Walkin' with the Paraclete, that's Greek for the Spirit
They say the wild things'll eat you up
Who shall I fear when God is walking with me
If I die that's a win, that's the seed of the church plus I get to be with Him
And we so undefeated like Hanes made our sneakers
I had beef with Jesus and my sin it got deleted
So I gotta go and speak it to those who really need it
Let the Gospel off the leash, go and be where the beasts at

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Real recognize real; introduce ya’ self
Careful with that cannon boy; you might just shoot ya’ self
Somebody wake em’, tell em’ to stop fakin’
Before they end up lyin’ in the woods buck naked
These killas fulla’ them demons, while you pretendin’ you Scarface
You ain't really no ghetto boy, why you fakin’ that hard face?
That just made him furious; somebody call Fishburne
Tell these boys in the hood 40 cal hits burn
And hell burns hotter, I turn to the Father
I prayin’, “Lord forgive em’ ‘cause they lyin’ like Mufasa
They got these eight’ graders with they eyes on a choppa
I pray the Lord save ‘em ‘fo He drop ‘em and make ‘em stop it

[Hook]
