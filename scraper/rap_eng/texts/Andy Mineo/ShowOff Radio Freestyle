[Verse 1]
Great beat, it's kinda slow though
Ya know how it go though
Dudes be talkin' smack, but they money shorter than it's Frodo
Ya know though, the flow go solo, here we go so
Ya know know just how I get it off the dome yo, yeah
Everybody wanna see me when I get it
Got MC Serch right here with me, you know I'm with it
That's the 3rd Bass
Matter fact, drop the CD, bet it's comin' in that first place
But shoutout to the competition
I'm stompin' them though, hittin' them with that funky rhythm
They talkin' to me about cussin', man, I'm not with it
But get it, I could still sell them records and know I flip it
Every time I go up off the top they I know I got that funky rhythm, hit 'em
You know I'm shoutin' out that Nas from Queensborough
Ya know how I get, Andy's life so thorough
Ya know I gotta get it off the top son
I'm goin' right here, so let me drop one
We talkin' 'bout the Action to the Bronson
So I just might take his flow and make it sound like him though
It sound somethin' like, tell that stewardess to wake me up for breakfast
I need some Z's, my lifestyle been reckless
I shoulda said no, this year I said too many yesses
I'm tryna find a balance of gettin' rest and bein' aggressive
I'm young, creative, ambitious and motivated
Man, I'm schemin' for that kingdom
The world is ours for the takin'
You got the same 24 hours that I do
Instead you makin' moves, instead you makin' excuse
I'm like, one life to live so I'ma live it up
And if they ain't laughin' at your dreams then they ain't big enough
I gotta tell you how it is, that's how I get it up
My cup filleth up, my cup runneth over though
Ya know though, dang
Goin' off the top, it go slow
And I can't rearrange it everyday, you know it go though
I'm tryna tell you how it is
MC Serch, throw me a word and watch me show how I could search
Watch me get it

[Break]
MC Serch: I would like to hear a verse about prophets and profits
Andy: Prophets
MC Serch: And profits

[Verse 2]
Now, let me start with the prophets
Matter fact, hol' up, one second
I gots to stop it
Because I was just on the Sway show, he threw me Bibles of the book
And I was like, chill bro, this ain't the Biblio study
I gotta hit 'em off the top, you know I'm goin' like Kid Cudi
But I ain't singin' or goin' emo
They know just how I go
Yo, let me get back up on the topic, I'm talkin' 'bout the prophets
And, yo, I been doin' shows, maybe made a little profit
They tell me take a few, and then I stick it in my pocket
But you know I'm givin' ten percent because you know I gots to drop it, hol' up
You got another topic baby, I could flip it
Give me anything, you know that I go off the top and then I rip it

[Break]
Statik Selektah: Donald Trump!

[Verse 3]
Donald Trump, yeah, you know what's up
I don't know what's faker, this interview or his haircut
I tell you how it go though, that's just how it be
Statik Selektah on the 1's and 2's flowin' with me, can't nobody do that
You notice how I hit it with the trumpets
And I'm talkin' 'bout Trump, trump this
I trump you with the Trump card
Yeah, that's how it go bro
The head, off the top
And I'm goin' off the dome bro
Give me any topic, I swear to God that I could rip it
Swear to God, cause you know I love God
That's just how I get it
Hangin' with the Hennessy
Baby, I'm just gon' look around the studio
You better be reppin' with me
But I ain't drinkin' none, they had too many
You heard the questions that he asked me, right, he had too many
That's like, lookin' around the room
The cameraman, he's shootin' at me
I'm shootin' lines into your head, fam
I got the Patriots up on the screen
But why they winnin', cause the balls ain't deflated yet, get it
That's just how I spit it, you know I rip it off the top
They callin' the phone lines, I gots to get it
