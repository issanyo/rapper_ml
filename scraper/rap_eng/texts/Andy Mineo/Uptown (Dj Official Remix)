[Intro]
New York to the heart
We got love for all
Uptown baby, Uptown baby
We get down baby
For the crowd baby

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
We in love with the invention, we don't love the inventor
On a quiet block, they puff the loud, it be smellin' like it's Denver
And they hit you with the fake smile, I ain't talkin' dentures
Starbucks on the corner, pushin' bucks for that rent up
Dippin' in all black like I'm venom
Keep it G, I'm not a star, but I'm raw like this denim
Them dope boys push the big body, Jerome Bettis
I got Santería hexes from my exes, but I'm protected
You heard that man got shot for his necklace?
That's a 1-8-7 up on 1-8-7
You know that uptown lifestyle reckless when they eatin' mangú and fried cheese for your breakfast
Baby, how you gon' complete your life checklist spendin' every night watchin' Netflix?
Time is so precious, gotta invest it where you spend it
If we prisoners to comfort, we judge our own sentence
I be uptown

[Hook]
New York New York
I was born in the New York City
This is the way we walk in New York
Welcome to Washington Heights
The neighborhood where its full of working people


[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
I wake up in that mornin', gettin' that café con leche
Doña, hold that azucar, my stomach been showin' lately
Plus the crossover crazy, don't get caught out here sleepin'
That's why they call me Allen Irishman when I ball at Cabrini
I'm throwin' swishes
This right here that new school vintage
I been spendin' money tryin' not to spend up all these minutes
And I ain't been present, man, look at what my gift is
Some push the white cause they ain't have the privilege
Let's get it!
Ain't no other city like the one I'm in
I got that Bustelo in my cup again
Jim Carrey with this here, I'm goin' dumb again
Me, myself and I, the only thing I'm up against
New York stayin' lit, rent high, payin' it
La Marina by the water, date night favorite
My bodega on the corner, I ain't even sayin' it
They already know my order, they just started makin' it, woah!
