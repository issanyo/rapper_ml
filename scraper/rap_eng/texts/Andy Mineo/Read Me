[Intro: Benjah]
Wanna run from all my problems
But it won't solve anything
Because my idols work full time
It's the same old song with a different tune
And the jukebox just ran out
But I'm so tired of chasing times

[Hook]
I've been floatin' in this ocean like a bottle (like a bottle)
I'm just trying to find a home (home)
I wonder if what you would read would be just like a novel (like a novel)
When you open me up alone

Cause I-I feel it like
I-I can't wait to read you-you-you know I want to
I-I feel it like I-I can't wait to read
You-you-you know I want to (know I want to)

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Whoa! As far as I can see, there's a lot of fishes
They all different, I'm watching them as they swimming by
And everybody's tellin me to go and live your life
Go and get it right but I did it like a fool
Didn't even listen to my master
Did it my way and it ended in a disaster
Gotta live it lil patient, I wanna move faster
Built the house on a foundation that wouldn't last
But I see every moment that's slipping by
War is being written in the pages of my life
And it's chillin in this hollow frame, was hollering at dames
Now I hollowed be thy name, never to be the same
Still my past make it hard to forget
Took cues from the world makes it hard to commit
I must change just thinkin about sharin all of my sins
As you open me up, just know that I've been forgivin
I need my mind renewed with the truth
And then redefined with the definition of beauty is
No matter how the pages of the past look when I find you
We coauthoring the rest of this book. I've been...

[Hook]
Floatin' in this ocean like a bottle (like a bottle)
I'm just trying to find a home (home)
I wonder if what you would read would be just like a novel (like a novel)
When you open me up alone

Cause I-I feel it like
I-I can't wait to read you-you-you know I want to
I-I feel it like I-I can't wait to read you-you-you know I want to
I-I feel it like you-you can't wait to read me-me
You know you want to
I-I feel it like you-you can't wait to
Read me-me you know you want to (want to)

[Verse 2: Benjah]
They say you got to hit rock bottom
But it's hard down there where character starts from
True colors show in the storms like flags
On ships tryin to find new homes
And I hit a couple lows, dug my holes, sunset but rose
Glory in the morning
No need to morn cause he rose on the third, a dozen thorns
Set my past, road to Damascus
So far gone not even coke bottle glasses
Could help me see the depth of the gashes he took for me
To grant me access
Took the weight of my baggage
Paid my debt, pass through taxes
No degree burns except from matches
Eternity is my biggest asset

I'm weathered, kind of beaten down
Hope I'll be everything you need
I gave him ashes for beauty
My story isn't finished, show me grace now while you read
Because it's mainly who you see

[Hook]
I've been floatin' in this ocean like a bottle (like a bottle)
I'm just trying to find a home (home)
I wonder if what you would read would be just like a novel (like a novel)
When you open me up alone

Cause I-I feel it like
I-I can't wait to read you-you-you know I want to
I-I feel it like I-I can't wait to read you-you-you know I want to
I-I feel it like you-you can't wait to read me-me
You know you want to
I-I feel it like you-you can't wait to
Read me-me you know you want to
