[Hook: Willow Stephens]
It's just a phase
Babe, our love will change
But we are sure as the moon
Sure as the moon
It's just a phase
Babe, our love will change
But we are sure as the moon
Sure as the moon

[Verse 1: Willow Stephens]
You been lookin' for a sign in the sky
With your head in the clouds
Told me our love oh, it was bringin' you down
So for worse or for better, I'm in this forever
Just hang on and you'll see
That we are sure as the moon
Sure as the moon, yeah

[Hook: Willow Stephens]
It's just a phase
Babe, our love will change
But we are sure as the moon
Sure as the moon
It's just a phase
Babe, our love will change
But we are sure as the moon
Sure as the moon

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
So don't be anxious, we go through phases
I know some days we best friends, some days we strangers
I try to learn your love language
And by the time I do, I know it changes
Like, who's the new you? Oh hi, my name is Andy
Commitment ain't for cowards
That's when I gave the power to you
And said my life ain't mine no more
My life is ours
It's sweet and it's sour, the weeds and the flowers
I see them seeds inside you, what you could be tomorrow
And I'm invested
Some days the sex is honeymoon
Some days it's, "Honey, I ain't in the mood"
We interlude, but know our song don't finish
I'm long distance
Even if it all go wrong
Don't get it wrong, I'm in this

[Verse 3: Willow Stephens]
Don't need a sign in the sky to know a love that is true
Cause even a light in the sun can disappear from view
So whatever the weather, we're in this together
There's no doubt in my mind that we are sure as the moon
Sure as the moon, yeah

[Hook: Willow Stephens]
It's just a phase
Babe, our love will change
But we are sure as the moon
Sure as the moon
It's just a phase
Babe, our love will change
But we are sure as the moon
Sure as the moon

[Bridge: Willow Stephens]
Father Time is ever-knowing
Don't worry if the fire dies
Just watch it wax and wane
Pushing, pulling
I'll be glowing
Don't you know the embers burn
Much hotter than flames?
Woah

[Hook]
It's just a phase
Babe, our love will change
But we are sure as the moon
Sure as the moon
It's just a phase
Babe, our love will change
But we are sure as the moon
Sure as the moon
