[Verse 1: Tedashii]
You ain’t got it like that
Sorry I’m the one that gotta drop it like that
People play a part now you gotta act
I ain’t going for it you can stop it where it’s at
You ain’t got it like that
Sorry I’m the one that gotta drop it like that
People play a part now you gotta act
I ain’t going for it you can stop it where it’s at
Faith ends well
They pretend well
But that never ends well
Fail, never ends well
Please, excuse my escape
Who can I run to when everybody fake
I ain’t usually impatient but I just couldn’t wait
Really wasn’t sure how much more I could take
Frontin’, like they really off something
When they really nothin, everybody stuntin
Like they in the movie but they not in the credit
Dyin to be remembered
(Forget ‘em)

[Chorus: Andy Mineo]
Is this a fantasy, land
I don’t think I know where I am
But then again (who really knows)
Is this a fantasy, land
I don’t think I know where I am
But then again
Why don’t you catch me if you can
Catch me if you can
Why don’t you catch me if you can
Catch me if you can
(Until then)

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
Mister, he the keeper
Chief chiefa with cheeba under your seata
Keeper, you keepa
Model diva like Rama Decomacita
Keep the deceive a diva that kiss just below your sneakers
(I don’t believe you people!)
Low down dirty
So clown worthy
I take you as a joke I’m not trying to provoke just shock
As I watch people come to us not
And the crowd goes wild while a smile still in shock
We run to the place with familiar faces
Cope with my pain and conceal in anguish
I burryin my soul like in the garden naked
Aware of my flaws and it’s hard to take it
My image in the mirror it’s hard to face it
We all lost perfection we chose to replace it
Tryin to remember but somebody erased it
Now all I know is I’m tryin to escape it
Picture perfect art till it’s hung kinda odd
Framed in my pain and it’s hung kinda off
Tryna get it straight but I can’t ‘cause it’s hard
Hidin in the bushes I don’t want to get caught

[Chorus: Andy Mineo]
Is this a fantasy, land
I don’t think I know where I am
But then again (who really knows)
Is this a fantasy, land
I don’t think I know where I am
But then again
Why don’t you catch me if you can
Catch me if you can
Why don’t you catch me if you can
Catch me if you can
(Until then)

[Outro: Tedashii]
People claim I broke laws but who really knows
Chippin' Paint with this Shawshank who really knows
People claim I broke laws but who really knows (who really knows)
(Why don’t you catch me if you can)
People claim I broke laws but who really knows
Chippin' Paint with this Shawshank who really knows
People claim I broke laws but who really knows (who really knows)
(Why don’t you catch me if you can)
