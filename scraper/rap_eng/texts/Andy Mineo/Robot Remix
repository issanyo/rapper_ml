I'm saved now, I ain't gotta do what you say!

[Verse 1: Swoope]
I was born less than human
I know it sounds crazy
But I was really born a robot into slavery
Everywhere I even need a saving because the chains that they gave me was a brain
I said that everything gravy
I couldn't feel my way through sin
I had my vision braille
They told me death in the this prison cell it isn't hell
When it really was
But my chains came
When Jesus spilling blood came and showed me heal and love
Rebooted, reprogrammed, redirected
116 preach heaven through the message
116 Jew first, then we second
Cause 116 way bigger than Reach Records
It's the power of God unto salvation
The saving of his people from the grips of satan
So the sins have been undone
We 116 living by the six one one Romans

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Money, tax, power, lust, ?, me, must, have, these,  I am after I can not rebel against my master
What's going on?
System malfunction somethings gone wrong
I was just fine focused on I
Now I hate what I love something happened inside
Somebody told me about Jesus
Going to the pine to pay for the sin that was mine
I heard it many times
But it never made a difference
Now somehow I grew ears that can listen
This is weird the one I was dissin'
Came here to unsmear my vision
Before I dismiss they already got me thinkin'
Somebody must of changed the circuit boards in my system
This really wasn't me
I never would of chose this he must of chose me
I should of been crushed by my own John King
Now I ain't a robot homie that's the old me
