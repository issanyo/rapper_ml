[Verse 1]
I don't understand, you said you were there for me
You said you would never leave, you said you care for me
I hate the fact I ever trusted you so terribly
I wish that I could let it go but inside its been tearing me
Apart, shame on me, I should've seen this coming from the start
For such a pretty girl I thought you'd have more of a heart
Thought things were going well, why'd you have to make them hard
I gave you all I got, and all you gave me was a scar
I don't get it, what'd I do to deserve it
You said you had my back, but you left me deserted
Thanks a lot, you're the reason why I carry this burden
Thanks to you I'm insecure, you're the reason I'm hurting
And if you really care about me, how come you never ask
What I'm doing, how I've been, I hate your damn lying ass
I wish that I could forget you, cut you out of my past
But I can't do that cause the memories you gave me will last
I can't get rid of you, you told me you would rather be friends
And thanks to you I lost every bit of my self-confidence
And to be honest I never knew you could do such damage
I wish my memories of you would disappear or vanish
I want you out of my head, I want you out of my brain
The day you left me it felt like I just got hit with a train
You told me so many lies, oh why did God create pain
I used to love my life but thanks to you it don't feel the same
No

[Chorus]
I just hope that you're happy
I just hope your life is better now that it's without me
I just hope you got everything that you wanted
Girl I hope you know that's everything I ever wanted
I just hope that you're happy
I just hope
I just hope you're happy
No no no
I just hope that you're happy
I just hope
I just hope you're happy
No no no

[Bridge: Andy Mineo]
When I get above those clouds

[Verse 2]
Girl I remember when we met, we couldn't wait to hang out
I thought we had the drive together til you took a new route
You used to always flood my mind but now up there it's a drought
You threw me into troubled waters and you watched as I drowned
Next time that you feel alone remember what you put me through
I said I'm doing better, you and I both know that isn't true
I check who saw my story just to see if there's a view from you
And thanks to you, no matter where I go the sky is never blue
I hope you know these wounds you gave me never healed
So I thought that if I smile I could keep it all concealed
Maybe if I say I'm fine they won't notice the pain I wield
Insignificant, I wish these words I spoke weren't so damn real, ah
When you left you said you wanna keep in touch
But it's been over a year, how come you never hit me up
You're the type of girl I can't imagine anyone could love
Girl I thought you cared about me, turns out you don't give a-
You were one in a million, I was replaced in a minute
I shoulda seen this shit coming, not proud to say that I didn't
Did you get what you wanted, or did you lose what you didn't
Don't worry I'm doing fine, ah who am I kidding

[Chorus]
I just hope that you're happy
I just hope your life is better now that it's without me
I just hope you got everything that you wanted
Girl I hope you know that's everything I ever wanted
I just hope that you're happy
I just hope
I just hope you're happy
No no no
I just hope that you're happy
I just hope
I just hope you're happy
No no no
I just hope that you're happy
I just hope your life is better now that it's without me
I just hope you got everything that you wanted
Girl I hope you know that's everything I ever wanted
I just hope that you're happy
I just hope
I just hope you're happy
No no no
I just hope that you're happy
I just hope
I just hope you're happy
No no no

[Bridge: Andy Mineo]
I know that the sun is out

[Outro: Adrian Stresow]
Everybody's moving on without me
Seem like everybody having fun except me
Feel like ain't nobody give a shit about me
Everybody got each other's back except me
Feel like everybody making moves without me
Seem like ain't nobody that I meet accepts me
Feel like ain't nobody give a damn about me
Everyone I know is finding love except me
