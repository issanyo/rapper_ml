[Intro: Andy Mineo]
Swerve, banzini
Fugetaboutit

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Paisano's wylin', paisano's wylin'
Paisano's wylin', paisano's wylin'
Red wine on everything, red wine on everything
Red wine on everything
Last call, it won't cost you anything
I stay wylin', I stay wylin'
I stay wylin', paisano's wylin'

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Banzini
Say I won't rock Fubu, sucka (say I won't, say I won't)
I don't do what you do, sucka (no I don't, no I don't)
Waka Flocka, Waka, Waka
Westside like I'm 2Paca (westside!)
Hdddddd like I'm Chewbacca (Star Wars, boy!)
Hdddddd like I'm Chewbacca!

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Paisano's wylin', paisano's wylin'
Paisano's wylin', paisano's wylin'
Red wine on everything, red wine on everything
Red wine on everything
Last call, it won't cost you anything
I stay wylin', I stay wylin'
I stay wylin', paisano's wylin'

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Yeah, I might just throw a Buddha 'round my necklace
They think paisano's wylin', that boy reckless
Cause everybody rockin' Jesus pieces
I'm just doin what y'all doin', wearin' stuff I don't believe in
You don't need skill for new rap
Check the first verse, you know I proved that
Takin' them selfies, girl why would you do that?
You know it's wack, and I do not approve that
I said red wine, I don't mean where the booze at
I'm talkin' an offer, you just can't refuse that
On a swag boat, I'm the captain
You can walk the plank for the yappin'
Boooooooi!

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Paisano's wylin', paisano's wylin'
Paisano's wylin', paisano's wylin'
Red wine on everything, red wine on everything
Red wine on everything
Last call, it won't cost you anything
(I stay wylin', I stay wylin')
(I stay wylin', paisano's wylin')

[Break: Marty]
Hey yo, rappers carry my mother's groceries, dog. Out of respect!

[Verse 3: Marty]
Thirty chains around my neck
Mr. T and velour sweats
I got em like, "What's next?"
I'm gonna kill the beat like an acapella
Social Club be them good fellas
Only good cause He met us
I'm a big mess and couldn't be better
Whatever, whatever, I'm wylin'!
Wylin', wylin', wylin'
It's the 116 and the Misfits, and we wylin'
Hey, yo, put my mom on the guest list
I'm so awkward, it's impressive
Girl's like, "Who the heck's this?
You're kinda weird, but I respect it"
I'm just young, Italian, and reckless, and we wylin'!

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Paisano's wylin', paisano's wylin'
Paisano's wylin', paisano's wylin'
Red wine on everything, red wine on everything
Red wine on everything
Last call, it won't cost you anything
I stay wylin', I stay wylin'
I stay wylin', paisano's wylin'

[Outro: Andy Mineo]
Listen, under normal circumstances if someone's running their piehole
I just give 'em a good smack to the face
But I don't handle things the way I used to
I am a Christian boy now, you understand, capisce?
Listen, you keep on runnin' your piehole
And I'm gonna take you over to my grandmother's house for a nice Sunday dinner
She'll have the kirchoff flakes, the fresh mozzarella, the marinara
We'll have a real good time
When you can't eat anymore we'll have her open up the fridge
And take out the canolis and the pustard shots
And keep feeding you and feeding you and feeding you, heh?
Then I'm gonna drive you home, throw you in the bathroom, lock the door
And burn every piece of toilet paper you own, you schmutz!
God bless you and your family
