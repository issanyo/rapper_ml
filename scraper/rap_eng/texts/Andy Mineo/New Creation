[Intro]
Yeah, epic
I, I'm a new creation
Homie, I don't live the life I used to life
So all of my people in the 'Cuse town who used to know me
I bet they don't know me now

[Verse 1]
To all my love and loyalty brothers
I've seen you from the beginnin' and what became of each other
I sit and think about the times in the studio layin' rhymes
I was workin' the boards, makin' dough on the grind
And then all of a sudden I went and left it behind
Still to this day, people callin' me askin' me, "Why, like how could you leave all that money?
It must be something to change your mind
What kinda treasure you find?"
I'm like, the Holy Spirit was convictin' my sin
And even though I was just runnin' the sessions I was connected in it
Usin' my gifts and my talents, to God givin' me the mix iniquity the music that promotes wickedness
I'm not tryna get slick with this
I'm just sayin' that most of the kids spittin' about the women and hittin' chicks
Was wearin' Jesus pieces, callin' themselves Christians
Homie, what some bonafide hypocrites
I don't gotta go deeper because you know your songs
And I don't gotta ask your moms 'cause you know you wrong
And I ain't tryna bash you, rather ask you
Come and follow Jesus with me, deny the fast route
How much longer will my city defy the holy God
And give praise with they lips and never they lives
'Cause they want the money, women and all the pride
But don't ride for somethin' they can take with 'em after they die

[Hook]
I, I'm a new creation
Homie, I don't live the life I used to life
So all of my people in the 'Cuse town who used to know me
I bet they don't know me now
It ain't the same Andy
The sin I once used to love now I hate
Full of mistakes
But the cross done changed my ways
Since I repented, turned from sin and started livin' by faith

[Verse 2]
I came out nine pounds, three ounces
I was a 80s baby
Sinner from the womb, shoulda called me a Haiti's baby
I was paper chasin'
Like Kanye, thought I could buy my way to heaven
Not dependin' on that grace, amazin'
People told me water was sweet, had to taste it
From myself, or else I ain't had a chance of changin'
And while I was still sinnin'
God loved me so much that He pinned His son to the cross so I could be forgiven
He became my wrath substitute
That's why it's Jesus over hip-hop, do the math, love the truth
I gotta new set of eyes
The world's behind me, yo, the cross before me
Now I view my prize, tryna subdue my pride
Live by the pwoer of the Holy Spirit, givin' me discernment
Not to peep it lurkin'
The gift and the curse is I'm a people person
Scandalous women tryna get it while they see me churchin'
I see 'em comin' but my natural man keep on flirtin'
When I really should be runnin' like the pizza burnin'
Puttin' my beats with sermon so I defeat the serpent
'Cause if my life don't worship, then it defeats the purpose

[Hook]
I, I'm a new creation
Homie, I don't live the life I used to life
So all of my people in the 'Cuse town who used to know me
I bet they don't know me now
It ain't the same Andy
The sin I once used to love now I hate
Full of mistakes
But the cross done changed my ways
Since I repented, turned from sin and started livin' by faith
