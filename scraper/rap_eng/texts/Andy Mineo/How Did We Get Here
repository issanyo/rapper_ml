[Intro: Propaganda]
Well I feel it
It's the blood of my ancestors resting in my chest, bro
Jah was so great

[Verse 1: Propaganda]
Yeah, cause I remember karaoke mics pointed at the speaker
Boom box play the tracks, CD skipped, bunch of raps
Open mics, night side, drive by ghetto bird
Hoping you can make it home
Better get swift with your words
Birthplace, earthquake
Hometown; it goes down
Learn to bust choppers before your ABC, tragedy
Survivor rivals the odds of tryin’ to fight gravity
A compliment when MC say come battle me, stay cool
Now a dad, college grad, quit my job, hit the road
Tryin’ to get my marriage happy
Ask about me at the bottom of the 710, holding down the sea port
Beach city, coast guard, Queen Mary, Snoop Lion
Trust me, I'm a native, the Hollywood sign be lyin' beneath it
Grave of a thousand young souls, take a stroll on a shore dream of Californication
And I still can't explain how any of us made it
It's grace

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
And I got a feeling I can't describe
I see this place when I close my eyes
Wake me up if we ever arrive
And tell me how did we
How did we get here?
Tell me how did we
How did we get here?
Tell me how did we
How did we get here?
Tell me how did we
How did we get here?
Tell me

[Verse 2: JGivens]
My hand prints left permanent stamps in
The steering wheel with the pressure of anvils
Fresh out the gate, the campus that gave us a canvas; blank
Unemployment rates, we scrambling for pay
Never stand still in a rat race
Speeding out of LA, couldn't be late that day
I'll be right back, I'm headed to Vegas cause Taylor got graduation, too
That round trip switched quick to a one-way, I'm surprised it's you
I hit the local circuit in churches scribblin' verses
Rehearsing them with no music so earth in due time can use them
For spoken word or whatever service
A movement; the music in Egypt was persecuted
Long go, faith is bullet proof
When you look around and pray that they won't shoot you to prove it
How did we get here, in a dream school?
Now when I swim here God planned it, I'm one of the fish here like Boom

[Hook]

[Bridge: Andy Mineo]
How, how, how, how (x6)

[Verse 3: Propaganda]
And I learned you ain't in love with this
Time to fire your publicist, I inspire above the mess
Your desire requires this lost angels city, don't pity us, fully aware
That's why I don't flinch at a bully scare
