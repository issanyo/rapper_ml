[Verse 1: Beleaf]
Yo, even if it means carrying an anvil up a steep hill
During an avalanche, I wanna walk inside His will
These habitats and conditions is giving me the chills
This is not a thrill, and it doesn't feel like a walk in the park
It kinda seems like I'm walking in the dark, lantern in my heart
These thorns and these thistles, are picking me apart
And cameras keep flashing, they depicting it as art
Fool, I'm on my knees right, stains on my jeans
Filthy from head to toe, I finally get to see light
Still in the batter's box after three strikes
Walking like Rev Run, steppin' in my three stripes
Walking this way and that way, I found a narrow path
It's like a tightrope He's gonna catch me, if I fall
Guess we all need a challenge
To battle through this race in the Cross that we balance

[Hook]
In that execution, jewelry on your chest
Pick it up, and if you would look to it
Your soul will find some rest, pick it up
Ooh, pick it up, pick it up

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Question, how would your face look if Jesus were to
Scroll through a page of your Facebook?
Better one, would He be a bit confused
If He seen His name written in your religious views
Feeling conviction, they tick like
"Didn't you know He's love? "
Yeah you right but when He come back He the judge
Lamb to the Lion, He's ruling the nations
Packing a rod of iron, making a fool of Satan
Tattoo on His thigh, King of kings, Lord of lords
That's the name that's inscribed
White horse as a ride, got flames in His eyes I'm not playin'
His fury is crushing enemies like grapes into wine
Ain't nobody know the day or the time
So I pray that you make up your mind, deny yourself and take up the pine
Live the Cross, it ain't a chain or design, cause sin is wack
Don't wear one on your chest if you don't bear one on your back, fam

[Hook]
In that execution, jury on your chest
Pick it up, and if you would look to it
Your soul will find some rest, pick it up
Ooh, pick it up, pick it up

[Verse 3: Andy Mineo]
He want us sold out, searching our hearts
Even believers got sin that they keep in the dark
You know that one thing, God ain't pleased with
He told you give it up, you wanna keep it
You got a million excuses, a billion reasons
But at the end of the day you still ain't at peace yet
Well let me let you in on a secret
We can't go deeper in our relationship till we leave it
Decease it, put it to sleep like a Posturepedic
Cause sin is a fatal disease and only Jesus can treat it
And light of the fact that He freed us
By His blood, cleaned us, washed and redeemed us
Uh, that's reason to make us rotate from our old ways
Desire to please and obey, tell the Lord okay
When the road may seem kinda lonely, my life Your way
Yeah
