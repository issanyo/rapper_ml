[Verse 1]
It's kinda crazy, it's kinda crazy that your name is Grace
Your name is Grace
Cause that's what I need, that's what I need right now in this crazy place
It's crazy, crazy, crazy
It's not that I did somethin', it's the fact that I didn't
And I'm so ashamed it took twenty-five years just to get it
Cause people made fun, and I just laughed with 'em
But that was me as a child
I just pray you forgive me

[Hook]
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na, na
Hear my heart beat, hear my heart beat
Hear my heart
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na, na
Hear my heart beat, hear my heart beat
Hear my heart beat

[Verse 2]
I remember your son graduation
That's when I met your friends
And they was all havin' conversation
But they was sayin' stuff that I couldn't understand
Then all of a sudden it felt like, I understood something I missed my whole life
For the first time I was wearin' your shoes
For the first time I was hearin' your views
I never knew how complicated life is when you feel so isolated
And I know we don't speak much
Cause when talking got hard all I ever did was throw the peace up
My big sister Grace, I'm sorry I never learned to sign
And even though you were born deaf
I pray you forgive me for the years I lived blind

[Hook]
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na, na
Hear my heart beat, hear my heart beat
Hear my heart
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na, na
Hear my heart beat, hear my heart beat
Hear my heart beat

[Bridge]
Sometimes, sometimes these words aren't enough
So let me show you, let me show you
Sometimes, sometimes these words aren't enough
So let me show you, let me show you
It's kinda crazy

[Hook]
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na, na
Hear my heart beat, hear my heart beat
Hear my heart beat
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na, na
Hear my heart
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na, na
Hear my heart beat
