[Intro]
Gawvi blew the speaker, yeah
Gawvi blew the speaker

[Verse 1]
Westside with Carlos ain't never seen East Carlow
He hit the switch in that Carlo
Then filled the swisher with narco
Eyes up on that crucifix, Woodgrain I'm gon' grip
Jim Jones, 78
Purple drink they gon' sip
That's H-town if you ain't know
My Uptown, they still low
It's all praise to the most High
Please give a hand for the new guy
That trap house with sold D's, Let's burn that like Left Eye
Wack rappers got no steez, cookie cutter still gon' try
Mobbin with the squadron, boards was all out on Lebrayo
With that outdoor smell like indo, and I got my eyes on Taylor
Thought we did this for the money?
Y'all was way off
I spent my winnings Uptown, we was way North
I think all they hope gone
Man, I wanna kill all of my verses and send em' to Sufjan
She said that she let her get two on
Cocaina in the hall, papi said they gonna ball
Alcohol, adderall
Pass out in the dirty stall, Lord

[Hook]
Wah gwan? Call the selector (I call him)
They beez in the trap, they want the nectar (they want it)
You can get it for the low, shouts to Hector
She try and drop it to the floor, I ain't let her
Wah gwan? Call the selector (I call him)
They beez in the trap, they want the nectar (they want it)
You can get it for the low, shouts to Hector
She try and drop it to the floor, I ain't let her

[Post-Hook: Andy Mineo]
Ridin' around with that beater (wah gwan)
With that beater (wah gwan)
With that beater
We know who it is man, who can defeat it?
Ridin' around with that beater
With that beater (wah gwan)
With that beater
We know who with us, man who could defeat us?

[Verse 2]
I smoke that THC, they lookin' DOA
In Californ-I-A, no love for CHP
Man, I was like Wah Gwan? and they was like Wassup?
You know we out here dun, it's time to wake ya'll up

[Hook]
Wah gwan?
Call the selector (I call him)
They beez in the trap, they want the nectar (they want it)
You can get it for the low, shouts to Hector
She try and drop it to the floor, I ain't let her
Wah Gwan? Call the selector (I call him)
They beez in the trap, they want the nectar (they want it)
You can get it for the low, shouts to Hector
She try and drop it to the floor, I ain't let her
