[Verse 1: Joel]
Are the walls to lock you in or to keep others away
And if the doors were to be opened would you leave or would you stay
The comfort of your misery you cherish dearly, you cherish dearly
And you haven't started dreaming ‘cause you’re still fast asleep, you’re fast asleep

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
But don't you want to
Run wild, live free
Love strong, you and me

[Verse 2: Joel]
You’re a lion full of power who forgot how to roar
You’re an eagle full of beauty but you can’t seem to soar
Will you return to the garden where we were first made whole
Will you turn to the one who can liberate your soul

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
But don't you want to
Run wild, live free
Love strong, you and me
Run wild, live free
Love strong

[Chorus]
To every soul locked in a cage
In the prison of your past mistakes
No, there's no time left to waste
Yeah, you can make your great escape
We’re made to run wild, run wild, run wild
We’re made to run wild, run wild, run wild

[Bridge: Andy Mineo]
Run, Forrest, all depends what direction
Some people run from fear, some from their own reflection
Some people run their mouth, some people run their house
Ruling with the heart of a tyrant
Some people run their block, bust shot with a 4-4-5 and
That’s the environment, how we were raised
Living like lions but trapped in a cage
Back to Imago Dei with the blood of a king but the heart of a slave
Don’t you wanna run

[Pre-Chorus]
Run wild, live free
Love strong, you and me
Run wild, live free
Love strong

[Chorus]
We’re made to run wild, run wild, run wild
We’re made to run wild, run wild, run wild

[Outro]
If your soul’s locked in a cage
You can make a great escape
We’re made to run wild, live free
Love strong, you and me
