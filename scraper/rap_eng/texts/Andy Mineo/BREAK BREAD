[Pre-Chorus: Beam]
Get it right
Sleepless nights
All my day ones
I think it's time
Grape vine
Mmm, pop the wine
Take a drink and

[Chorus: Beam]
Break this bread
Break this bread
Say a prayer
Bow my head, ayy
I break this bread
Break this bread, ayy
I break this bread
Break this bread, mmm

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Bird
Yeah, break bread, well who baked it with you?
Share blessings, who prayed it with you?
Who stayed the same and they ain't switch up
When you doing good then they always pick up
Beat makers won't hit us up
Like we been cool, yeah I know what's up
They want to get a cut so they can get a cut
That's a long line you don't get a cut
Hit Pablo when I need a cut
The diablo, man I'm going up
They only 'round you when you got that bread
I call them ducks, when they call, I duck
They don't know about that work (tell 'em)
When I did all my own merch (tell 'em)
One train to two-forty-first (what else)
Garbage bag full of t-shirts (go get it)
Pack 'em and ship 'em, man, pack 'em and ship 'em
Brick after brick I was building this building (yeah)
I never waited around for permission (no)
I used that God given strength to go get it
Oh my, we came a long way
But we went the long way
No radio song play
That's why what we got is so strong, ayy
That's why you can't take it from me

[Pre-Chorus: Beam]
Get it right
Sleepless nights
All my day ones
I think it's time
Grape vine
Mmm, pop the wine
Take a drink and

[Chorus: Beam]
Break this bread
Break this bread
Say a prayer
Bow my head, ayy
I break this bread
Break this bread, ayy
I break this bread
Break this bread, mmm

[Verse 2: Wordsplayed]
Yeah, Lo-Fi
I got it the long way
Randy Moss from Culpepper
Cold shoulders turned to warm wishes
They don't think that I know better
Paid a bill, my pleasure
Get me back, no pressure
The industry kills busy bees
All buzz, no nectar
Came in the game and took notes
Hopped on the wave and kept it afloat, uh
Run in my-run in my lane
Smile for the pic when I'm winning, Usain
Built something up, then I flipped it
These on the merch, then I shipped it
Got a whole lot, so I give it
Only one life, let's live it
DIY or DOA
Say your prayers or be the prey
F&F will never pay
Either way, we always say
Look out, we did it the long way
That Kyrie and LeBron way
Run with the family, always
Trust touchdown on the runway
Break bread

[Pre-Chorus: Beam]
Get it right
Sleepless nights
All my day ones
I think it's time
Grape vine
Mmm, pop the wine
Take a drink and

[Chorus: Beam]
Break this bread
Break this bread
Say a prayer
Bow my head, ayy
I break this bread
Break this bread, ayy
I break this bread
Break this bread, mmm
