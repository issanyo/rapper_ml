[Intro: Elevation Worship]
Your will be done
Your, Your will be done
Your will be done
Your kingdom come
Your will be done
On earth as it is, in Heaven
For Yours is the Kingdom
Power and glory
Forever You reign
Forever You reign
So let hope, swell in our lives
So let hope, swell in our lives
We will be the Church, to live out Your heart
Take heart, for You have overcome the world
May Your Kingdom come

[Hook: Skrillex]
You gotta believe there's something more

[Sample]
(I'm just like you... you don't need to hide... For I am just like you) (backwards x2)
Yes

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
So let me just shadow you, let me trace your lines
Matter of fact, just take my pen, here, you create my rhymes
Cause if I do this by myself, I'm scared that I'll succeed
And no longer trust in you, cause I only trust in me (me)
And see, that's how you end up headed to destruction
Paving a road to nowhere, pour your life out for nothing
You pulled my card, I'm bluffing, You know what's in my hand
Me, I'm just going to trust you, You cause the dice to land
I'm in control of nothing, follow you at any cost
Some call it sovereign will, all I know is you the boss
Man, I'm so at ease, I'm so content
I'll play the background-d-d-d-d-d

[Hook] (x2)

(I can play the background) (x7)

[Matt Chandler]
The fullness of joy and pleasure is found in a submission to God and how He designed the universe to work
All the commands of God and Scripture as difficult as they might be are not about God in His power forcing you to do His will
But God in His love trying to put you into how He created the universe to work so that you might walk in joy and He might be glorified
Because God is not glorified in making you miserable
I mean He is God
Think about what a horrible tactic that is
"You know what I'm going to do, I'm going to make My people very gloomy, very sad, very repressed
And in that repression people will look at them and say "I want some of that""
It's just simply not true
If God's the Creator of all things, who knows how things work better than the one who created them
That's how we teach here that obedience to the scriptures which is ultimately obedience to God, who leads us into, who walks us into joy (Joy, joy jo-jo-o)
Obedience to the scriptures which is ultimately obedience to God, who leads us into, who walks us into joy
(Joy, joy, joy, joy)
