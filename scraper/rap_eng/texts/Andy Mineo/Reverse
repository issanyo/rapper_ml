Livin' in (reverse) [x16]

[Chorus: Andy Mineo]
Why is the monster taller than ever, while the weak fade away?
When justice storms, and darkness flees, I'm reminded on that day
The last shall be... (first), the first shall be... (last) [x3]
The last shall be... (Livin' in, livin' in reverse)
And everything's in reverse

[Verse 1]
Livin' with the end in mind, something like the president
I was livin' for the moment, tryin' to own it, residence
Believe in Him, that's the last thing I done ever chose
Gimme that rag top, trey on them chosen vogue
(I rode) That '67 Chevy my cousin drove on them golden spokes?
Life is short, and man I hope I make it down the road
But where I'm from, hope was that girl who flirted, flaunted
You never got it, but she was the one you always wanted
How good a picture perfect image front and tell you lies
My version of perversion did it every day a lie
And man that burden got me hurtin' lookin' for some answers
Endless searchin' just leave you burnin': Jo Jo Dancer
But mine ended when I saw the Lord would choose to hang
That type of love got me coming back, call it boomerang
Yet you can end the searches living waters quench my thirst
This is the day I die now I'm livin' in reverse

[Chorus: Andy Mineo]
Why is the monster taller than ever, while the weak fade away?
When justice storms, and darkness flees, I'm reminded on that day
The last shall be... (first), the first shall be... (last) [x3]
The last shall be... (Livin' in, livin' in reverse)
And everything's in reverse

[Verse 2]
Man all I ever wanted, was to be labeled the greatest
Cassius Clay on spittin' rhymes while rockin' the lastest
But that crept into my life in Christ, it was evident
As I debate how I was better than the rest of them
Work-based righteousness; base my worth on some type of list and
If I keep it or not perfected every night since this
Now, I'm looking for approval, and I'm selfish!
So all I want to do is try to out do you
Silent when you ask me. Later I'm bragging like a fool
Far from His image and couldn't see it. Where is the Zoom?
It's His grace in my moment of reproof. That helps me see the truth
Just how I sound; no auto-tune
And in this life the last will be first and the first is last
And he's a servant to the end. We certain of that
That's what I heard; freedom from the curse
Livin' to it hurts, but the latter doesn't matter when you in reverse

[Chorus: Andy Mineo ]
Why is the monster taller than ever, while the weak fade away?
When justice storms, and darkness flees, I'm reminded on that day
The last shall be... (first), the first shall be... (last) [x3]
The last shall be... (Livin' in, livin' in reverse)
And everything's in reverse

[Verse 3]
Man, I'm longin' for that day when the trumpet sounds
I imagine in an instant I'd be off the ground
Face to face with my Maker, with the glorious Savior
Embraced by Forever, no pain, free from labor
And from my sinful nature, And we see Hope revealed
Free from every tribulation, see He broke the seal
Every saint around the throne in worship
Of the Perfect cause He purged us and He purchased us cause Hell is real
Receiving what we all deserve
That where we see the first shall be last and the last will be first
Either way, He's such a generous God
It doesn't matter if you've been here forever or just started to jive
He rewards us for our work, so life's not in vain
And every saint, hold on He's comin' again!
Revelation's only scary if you're not in Christ
So I don't shine, I reveal. call it blacklight

[Chorus]
Why is the monster taller than ever, while the weak fade away?
When justice storms, and darkness flees, I'm reminded on that day
The last shall be... (first), the first shall be... (last) [x3]
The last shall be... (Livin' in, livin' in reverse)
And everything's in reverse
