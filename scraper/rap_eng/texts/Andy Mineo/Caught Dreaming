[Intro: for KING & COUNTRY]
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
And the colors seem
A burning tree speaking to me
I'm caught dreaming

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Why waste my breath singing words of praise
That are filled with myself? Who's greater?
What love do I have that You didn't give
Cause all that I am is a product of grace
And what should I trust, Your love for me
Or my love for You? Who's greater?

[Hook: for KING & COUNTRY]
I'm caught dreaming
Of someone greater than me
Who cut the sea
A burning tree speaking to me
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
Bringing liberty
The blood on Your tree is saving me
I'm caught dreaming

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Yeah, mouth full of praise, I love you so much
What an empty phrase, really I'm more amazed
How in spite of how I fail to do what You command to
Serve other gods like Baal, You never bail
That's illogical devotion, could it really be
You chose to die for the sinner when nothing was good in me
You never left me, even when the darkest days began
Nor forget me, only thing You're forgetting is my sin
I wanna make it to the end, let me remain faithful
All because You're faithful to me, yeah, I'm grateful
My mistakes can never stop the choice You make to adopt me
The holes in your hands are the proof that You'll never drop me

[Hook: for KING & COUNTRY]
I'm caught dreaming
Of someone greater than me
Who cut the sea
A burning tree speaking to me
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
Bringing liberty
The blood on Your tree is saving me
I'm caught dreaming

[Bridge: for KING & COUNTRY]
I could sing how I love You, love You
But Your love for me is much greater
And I could sing how I love You, love You
But Your love for me is much greater

[Hook: for KING & COUNTRY]
I'm caught dreaming
Of someone greater than me
Who cut the sea
A burning tree speaking to me
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
Bringing liberty
The blood on Your tree is saving me
I'm caught dreaming
