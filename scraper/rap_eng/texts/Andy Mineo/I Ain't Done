[Chorus]
I ain't done, I ain't done, I ain't done
As long as there's breath in my lungs
I ain't done, I ain't done, I ain't done
As long as there's breath in my lungs, I ain't done

[Break]
Oh well if they don't like it
I might turn up by myself
I don't need opinions
No, I did this for myself (for myself, ayy)

[Verse 1]
I just remembered I'm dope, yeah
I just remembered I'm fly, yeah
They try and say "be humble"
Don't you know I'm made like God, yeah
All in my blood type
I was on straight for hard nights
Ain't done trying, get it done right
Keep comparin' myself, don't ever but
Believe in myself, no never again, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Death to my depression and anxiety
Death to all my stress and all I'm trying to be
I'ma get live, 'cause I'm still alive
And if I die, ain't no way I'm giving up now

[Chorus]
I ain't done, I ain't done, I ain't done
As long as there's breath in my lungs
I ain't done, I ain't done, I ain't done
As long as there's breath in my lungs, I ain't done

[Verse 2]
Uh, just came out of the winter
Just came out like a winner
Had a break down, couldn't stay down figure
Rather die trying, then to live like quitter, wooh
Yeah, my problems big, but I know God way bigger
What you 'spect? Once you level up
Don't you know the boss is bigger, yeah
Used to spend a lot of time daring myself
Then spent a lot of time comparing myself
Turn into the doubt, then the fear in myself
Overthinking to the point I was imparin' myself
Now I know why Chappelle went missing
Now I know why Brit got the clippers
Now I know why Ye started trippin
The pressure and the expectation get ya, ah

[Break]
Oh well if they don't like it
I might turn up by myself
I don't need opinions
No, I did this for myself (for myself, aye)

[Pre-Chorus]
Death to my depression and anxiety
Death to all my stress and what I'm trying to be
I'ma get live, 'cause I'm still alive
And if I die, ain't no way I'm giving up now

[Chorus]
I ain't done, I ain't done, I ain't done
As long as there's breath in my lungs
I ain't done, I ain't done, I ain't done
As long as there's breath in my lungs, I ain't done

[Outro]
I know you feel like you can't change
I know you think it'll always be the same
I want to be full of potential again
But I ain't done
