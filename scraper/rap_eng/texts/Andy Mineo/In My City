[Hook:  Efrain]
In my city, that's where God belongs
In my city, cause He run it anyway, He run it

[Verse 1:  Andy]
Look, Psalms 14 uno, you know
He says in his heart God don't exist, fool though
Who created the stars?  Planets like ours?
Pluto and Mars?
You need the proof, though?
The truth is so in the art
This the living God that I serve
Made everything in a minute with a single word
He be taking care of the bees and even the birds
Cause the truth is taking care of the people who are in the Word
Don't you see our sin brought a curse?
Christ redeemed us, now I know my prayers work since we believe He interceded
We are soldiers, an army, our sergeant is He
Our weapons are not carnal, yo, we start on our knees
We are a movement of the young, on fire and we zealous for the honor of our Father that's in Heaven
Bring Him

[Andy & Efrain]
In my city

[Hook:  Efrain]
That's where God belongs
In my city, cause He run it anyway, He run it
In my city, that's where God belongs
In my city, cause He run it anyway, He run it

[Verse 2:  Andy]
God, I'm so unashamed
This world thinks we insane
Cause we be living like in this life it's about Christ and to die is gain
We denying the fame, don't retire we aim
'Til our last breath to go and confess the Messiah's Name
So Thy Kingdom Come, Will be done
In our city until 'til we see Him in the Holy one
(New York, New York)
That's where the homie from, but I know I can't be the only one
Any believers in here?  Show me some
Get your hands up for the Holy Son
Fought death beat it, now you know we can defeat it
Go and read it, man, we already know we won
There's power when Your people
Will gather just to come seek Ya
Then ask for Your forgiveness, admitting we truly need Ya
Taking the Gospel to the ends of the earth
Searching for hearts, but first I think we going start right

[Andy & Efrain]
In my city

[Hook:  Efrain]
That's where God belongs
In my city, cause He run it anyway, He run it
In my city, that's where God belongs
In my city, cause He run it anyway, He run it

[Verse 3:  Andy]
So Father teach us how to pray, not just ramble off with a wishlist
Make us still and listen
Give us holy ambitions
We're called and commissioned
Your work here isn't finished
While we're living then we'll never ever fit in, misfits
Blessing those who hate us
Praise You in our affliction
The way the see us love one another is our distinction
They take You off our dollars and out the Pledge of Allegiance
But they'll never take praise out the mouth of believers

[Andy & Efrain]
In my city

[Hook:  Efrain]
That's where God belongs
In my city, cause He run it anyway, He run it
In my city, that's where God belongs
In my city, cause He run it anyway, He run it

[Andy & Efrain]
In my city.. He run it, He He He run it, He run it, He He He run it
In my city.. He run it, He He He run it, yeah
(Here, in New York City, we will not be silent) In my city..
(The capital of the world, we are the light of this world)  In my city...
He run it, He He He run it, yeah, He run it
Cause He run it anyway, He run it
