[Intro]
This should be played at high volume

[Sample of I Walked on the Moon by Brian Regan]
And I [?] myself right in the eye and myself from [?]
I couldn't tell this about [?] with my eye going on
And I was like me, me, me, me, me, me
Beware the me monster

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Going from the bottom to the top
Everybody wanna be somebody
Giving everything to get a shot
To get a little bit of face time
Going from the bottom to the top
Everybody wanna be somebody
But what if I told you, you, somebody knows you?

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Yeah, they say racks, on racks, on racks, on racks, huh?
I bet they never told you about that tax on tax, huh?
Tyshane got tracks on tracks
So I put a rap to it, back to it
With a passion to use it for the movement
It’s tatted on back, if you unashamed where you at?
His kingdoms are already but not yet
We ready, we on deck
Come and get us, Maranatha
They ask me how I’m doin’ I say “better than I deserve”
'Cus I got the medicine, I was in sin sick
Now I’m walking upright, like… swerve

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: Wontel]
Somebody knows me but I don't know who they are
Cause I don't even know myself
True story though I'm chasing me, myself and I
A gorilla
A Godzilla
Selfish ambition wrapped in my selfish desires
God, I'm asking in Jesus name You put out these fires
Take away the sin and build me up, embrace now
I'm made in Your image
Wow
I guess I'm Batman cause it's long days and dark nights
My dark is out but that's how it feels so I hide be hind that alright
I'm okay
All good
But inside I'm all bad
I'm asking that You [?] please
Drop that

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro: Andy Mineo]
Everybody wanna be somebody
To get a little bit of face time
Everybody wanna be somebody
But what if I told you, you, somebody knows you?
