[Intro]
Come you sinners poor and needy
Weak and wounded, sick and sore
Jesus ready stands to save you
Grace requires nothing more
I will arise and go to Jesus
He will embrace me in His arms
In the arms of my dear Savior
There are ten thousands charms

[Verse 1]
Why is it every time I step up on a train
I see a pretty dame and I wonder what her name is?
Before I even get there the question on my brain is
Do you love the Lord, do you live to make Him famous?
Then the car stop, she step off, it's time to refocus
I'm questionin' my heart, examinin' my motives
Why I'm captivated by the brown skin mocha divas?
And I hope in my mind she's a believer
Ok, she got all that beauty, yeah, it's obvious
I can't let it take precedence over godliness
Now I'm gettin' restless, how I'm recognizin'
When I'm choosing'to take pleasure in all these false treasures They fool's gold
Instead of looking for them sundresses
I should be looking for the Son I confess it
Even though my pride's telling me don't ever let the fans know
I am not a superhuman, no, I'm a man
So the grace that I talk about on all my records
I need it for myself, cause really I'm just a mess
Findin' rest from the pressures of perfection
As I stand up on this platform they expectin'
Me to be a man without flaws, that's false
I am just another rapper that's called to point y'all to the cross
That's exactly where I'm headed
I'm just another beggar pointin y'all to where the bread is, man

[Chorus]
I'm not a superhuman, I am just a man
No, I'm not a superhuman, I am just a man
I'm not a superhuman, I am just a man but they never understand
I'm nothing more than a man lost dead in my sin
So here I am alive in Your hands
Your hands, Your hands

[Verse 2]
We dress up in nice heels, we try to make people buy'em
That's why when someone ask how we doin' we tell 'em fine
Knowin' we hurt inside, but tell me who's really lyin'?
They ain't really want to know how you doin', that cost time
That's way too expensive
And if I ever get a date with a dime I'm sendin' my representative
The version of Andy that's cropped and edited
I'm killin' this first impression, and I'm hidin' the evidence
Photoshoppin' the blemishes
These lies of perfection are the cry of the desperate
Men that want that want acceptance
Holdin' they breath, dyin' a thousand deaths
Forgettin' there's beauty inside the mess
What else could you expect, we obsessed over twitter numbers!
Checkin' ours, then comparin' them to others
Like, the number of likes upon a status is somehow supposed to raise our status
Boy, this is madness
We want the trophy wife who's the baddest and not some average
So we can feel like the man, Randy Savage
Take me off the shelf, I don't want to be for retail
I would rather be real, let you see the details
When we fail it feels like we fall so far cause they put us so high
I am not a star
I'm just a product of grace that's still in the process
And I don't gotta be great, because my God is
And I don't gotta be great, because my God is
I'm just a product of grace and guess what?
I'm still in the process, that's unfinished business

[Bridge]
Would you love me if I told you I couldn't fly?
I got no cape on and no mask on there's no disguise
Oh, I'm no hero
There's only one
Oh, I'm no hero
There's only one
And He's not for sale

[Hook]
