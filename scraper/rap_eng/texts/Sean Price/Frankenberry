[Verse 1: Sean Price]
One for the money, two for the dough
Three for the paper, that's all that I know
Broke with a job, or crook with the cash
You be hoping to God I don't put my foot in your ass
Got my foot on the gas, and I'm running the red
Put this pack in your ass, hide this gun in your dreads
Never go on the block, like I used to do
Why go on the block, all my niggas moved
Mister boom bap rap whatever
The black leather match the black Nike Venoms
So nice that my wife be in em
Body the grape ape great
Probably break one eighth of your face off
Break north
Fake and soft, pa and I hate all of you
Punch you in the face now you able to taste barbecue
Hard to do this, I'm doing me
You can do what you do, just don't do it in front of P
Personally, it's nothing personal
You send a verse for me, I'll send a hearse to you
Clearly it's that, really you wack
I'm actually one of the rappers that really can rap

[Verse 2: Buckshot]
One for the money, two for the dough
Three for the paper, that's all that I know
You call that a show, it's more of a circus
You tryna hear Buck flow, still calling 'em nervous
You fall for the service, you fall on your face
Judging shit backwards, stop calling this case
Now I'm all in your space, cause I'm outta this world
And if I show what's on my plate, say goodbye to your girl
She really a bird, cause you're giving her seeds
Believe, now she expect the same shit from me
Please, use your knees for a stand
You got a "Big Mouth", now Whodini my lil' man
Damn, it's a new pedestal that I sit on
So now my shit more and better stools
The tools, that I use: two hammers
One for the nail in your coffin, the next for your life after

[Verse 3: Sean Price]
Personally, it's nothing personal
You send a verse to me, I'll send a hearse to you
Clearly it's that, really you wack
I'm actually one of them rappers that really can rap
I'm actually one of them clappers that actually strapped
I'm actually running with Africans, trafficking smack
I'm actually smacking the nap off your faculty jack
Exploiting the Black, nigga nap Cadillac rap
Fake fuck, I will fuck up your face
Fuck face, finger fuck, trigger nigga the ape
P
Goodnight folks
