[Intro: Sean Price]
Yeah, sing with me
Da Da Da, Da Da, Da Da Da Da, Da Da Daa

[Verse One: Sean Price]
Yo, microphone check, one, two, what is this?
A bird, it's a plane, nigga mind your business
Witness, a real nigga ready to dump heat
Last king of Scotland, you niggas is lunchmeat
Ya mean? [?] team supreme
Mean flow when green glow, the Elohim (P!)
Team of feigns around me looking for good shit
Stash under a loose brick, holding the deuce fifth
This crack game remind me of the rap game
Bunch of bitch niggas getting smacked for wack chains
Champagne brain and deuce deuce thoughts
Now them niggas drink tall cans, flipping loose Newports (Damn)
P! I ain't with none of the bitch shit
Like saying peace God while you snacking on rib tips
I rip shit, I am the best rapper
You rip shit, you are the best crapper

[Verse Two: Buckshot]
Who the fuck is this calling me at 5:46 in the AM
Oh this bitch that swear to god she can sing like Lena Horne
So she lean on me hard for a job, oh my God
Naw, not you too Ms
Different chick same shit, "Buck I could do this"
You don't say? Word?
That's why I heard you sing right after we fucked the other day? Don't play Ma
Get the fuck out of the shower, or come fuck for an hour
Stop singing your problems, talking about
You wanna sing like Keyshia Cole
But you song like Keyshia when she reaching a cold so
Do him a favor, do me a favor
Suck dick right now save your singing for later
'Cause right now is just not a go
First things first, come here, let me show you how to blow

[Outro: Buckshot and Sean Price]
(Da Da Da, Da Da, Da Da Da Da, Da Da Daa)
Bitches want to sing for us
Mamma I want to sing, mamma I want to sing
You don't wanna sing bitch
Mamma I want to sing, mamma I want to sing
Mamma I want to sing, mamma, mamma
This is what she said to me Ruck
