Father y'all P (P!)

It's the G-O-D, Father y'all P (P!)
P body, hit dimes at parties

AIGHT NOW~! Pay attention to the God body Sean P
Smackin you niggas with the skill kid

And make y'all niggas straight retire
You get mad glory, and your flow is mad corny
Your tight-ass clothes put you in the fag category
{*laughs*} Y'all funny style like Brad brother Corey
Your broker than a fuckin joke like half on a 40
I blast on a shorty, youngin out of his mind
Dig your snotbox rocks in a box that's pine
Flesh, turn to maggots and worms just like swine
I kill your whole squad pah with just one line
I'm God Cypher Divine, all type of the rhyme
A weirdo, I hear those lines wastin time (wastin time)
Y'all can't fuck around with pah, please
It's the G-O-D, Father y'all P (P!)

[repeat 2X]
It's the G-O-D, Father y'all P (P!)
P body, hit dimes at parties
Desi on my hip, my chick and ice bling
Drama we bring, yo that's a small thing
