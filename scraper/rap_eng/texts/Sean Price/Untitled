It go clutch the rubble, they sitting in Sing-Sing
And doing a lot of time cause niggas do sing-sing
One look at my hand fam, look at the king's ring
Wedding band, shazam fam, nigga I sling things
Sean Price, big nigga, Ving Rhames
Michael Clarke Duncan, I don't like you, start something
Then you call me Kareem, all of this green
The god Shallah, be calling they cream
Baboon, Gem Star, splash goons
Stab wounds, niggas reading Qu'ran in bathrooms
Look like bitches: Vidal Sassoon
Hair done, nails done, hit 'em with a nail gun
I do me when the sket pop
Y'all booty, Call of Duty niggas on your X-Box
Tight pants niggas can't stand me now
Fuck 'em all except Danny Brown, P!
