[Hook: Bobby Capri]

I will never come up missing
Never come up missing
You know where to find me
I'm grinding. I'm on a mission
Princess Diana
I'm a die with tunnel vision
Dodging "Dirty Diana's"
That's "BAD" with bad intentions

I will never come up missing
Never come up missing
You know where to find me
I'm grinding. I'm on a mission
Princess Diana
I'm a die with tunnel vision
Dodging "Dirty Diana's"
I got Michael ambitions

[Verse 1: Bobby Capri]

As I wash my dirty hands up
I'm watching her pull her pants up
Lights coming through the curtains
It's early turning the fan up
It's hot; I'm sweating bullets
Another "Dirty Diana"
From the bucket getting fried with this chicken like Colonel Sanders
To doing just what I please
With nothing but perfect manors
She thinking she Jada Pinkett
Light blinking; turn on the camera
Where there's a "Will" there's a way
And I got way too much will
Thinking how her touch'll feel
And that we ain't just here to chill
Still, I feel unfulfilled
There's something I want for real
It's something I'd probably kill for
The feelings so unfamiliar
Yet it feels like I've been here
Yea, I be so fucking out of it
Yet it feels like I'm in here
I'm in here, just off the thought of it
Got a dream and I follow it
Follow it on some stalker shit
Must acknowledge the hustle
The fuck is the point in knocking it?
I'm a beat the door down til I break the hand I'm knocking with
I might be at the bottom, but promise that I'm on top of shit!

I will never come up missing
Never come up missing
You know where to find me
I'm grinding. I'm on a mission
Princess Diana
I'm a die with tunnel vision
Dodging "Dirty Diana's"
That's "BAD" with bad intentions

I will never come up missing
Never come up missing
You know where to find me
I'm grinding. I'm on a mission
Princess Diana
I'm a die with tunnel vision
Dodging "Dirty Diana's"
I got Michael ambitions

[Verse 2: Sean Price]

(P! Listen...)
Yo! King Kong
Kong King
I swing on n****s I don't sing (P!)
My fans appreciating the thug effort
Brownsville bully bars par no club records
Swear to god if I club, it's Billy club
Red Kool-Aid? That's really blood
Phhh...I know what I do to
Your face, play it safe and get Bobby to shoot you
You a dick in the butt dude
Dressed like New Edition when they in Krush Groove
Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, Mike...
Sean P hobby is ripping the mic
Listen, I'm a Muslim
I know Christian brothers
Who shop on Pitkin sip Christian Brothers
The one you come to for the one-two slaughter
Cause the Sun do shine like quarter water
P!

[Verse 3: Bobby Capri]

I set the bar so high for myself, I gotta jump to reach it
I'm waist deep in some muddy water, just ducking leaches
With their hands out. Fuck how long their reach is
I'm like two mimes fucking
I leave em fucking speechless
Sleepless
Tom in Seattle, I keep hearing I'm
Missing in action, just passing my time without em
So, no need to ask about the shit I'm missing out on
My vision is dead center, in the middle like I'm Malcolm
Like I'm Michael on the balcony
Holding em out the window
I told em it's all golden
I showed em alchemy's simple
But how come that won't convince em?
How come they only "wishing"?
And doing the same ol shit like the outcome is gon be different huh?!
You don't want it, like I want it?
What the fuck is up?!
If you ain't on it, like I'm on it
Then you fucking up
Over achieving, I don't believe in "just enough" or..
Coincidences, nothing happens "just because"
