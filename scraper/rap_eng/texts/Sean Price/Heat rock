Smacking niggas away,check em clappin back in their sleep
Breath down your bitch's neck, poke my dick in their back
Rapido cariño vamos i got the whip in the back

[VERSE 4 SEAN PRICE]

Relax after the gat clapped with a package of raw
Coke sniffin' choke chickens violating broads
Annihilate motherfuckers when im snipin' the force

[VERSE 5 REDLIGHT BOOGIE]

Fifteen big gun with the F beam

[VERSE 13 REDLIGHT BOOGIE]
The respect in my city be flexed, the gods with me
Move like you did it, yes i just did. Oh God did he?
Against all wars, i race and dance on bars
The U.S. never thought Amsterdam so hard
But they dont make em like boogie no more in the dutch
