[DJ announcer]
And now on the wheels of steel
He's New York's own PF (Cuttin')
When PF spins, people listen
It's the hot jam's hot mix
(Drum rolling)

[Sean Price]
"Yo y'all ready for my nigga Sean P?
Make some mother".. ya mean? Yell at that bitch!

[Kid]
Ight. Yo! You ready for my nigga Sean P?
So make some motherfucking noise!
(Drum roll ends)

[Verse snippet]
A-Yo, I eat your food dawg, the Eukanuba chewer
Shooting my luger, you bitch...
(Scratching) A-yo, I eat your food..
A-yo... A-yo....
