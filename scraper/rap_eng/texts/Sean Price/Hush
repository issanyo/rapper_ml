(Hook)
Now hush little baby, don't say a word
Ruck is gon' hit you with the nah mean you heard
If the nah mean don't do what it do
I beat the shit to drown and come back for part two

Yo, Leaders of the New School, leaders of the old school
Know Sean P put it down like he's supposed to
I be watching these niggas watchin the throne
Watch me take they wrist watch, now watch me go home
P, I've been workin with the gauge
Animalistic rapper, man of a certain age
The slugs from the eighth spin through ya
I ain't trying to talk dog, I ain't Ace Ventura
The Grape Ape, plate scrape, scrape shit, weight in a baggie
You hating, waiting with Jake in the alley
Uhh, crime buster, swine, 9 touch ya
Mother made you, mother had you but motherfuck you

(Hook x2)
Now hush little baby, don't say a word
Ruck is gon' hit you with the nah mean you heard
If the nah mean don't do what it do
I beat the shit to drown and come back for part two

Yo, you take a cab with a quarter ounce
That's old school, paper bag on the 40 ounce
I'm so cool, take the Jag to your daughter house
Tech nine text message to Sean, call your daughter house
Let me tell you what it's all about
Pop shit, get rich, bitch with a toilet mouth
"These rap niggas wack Ruck, call 'em out"
"Everybody wack except me", the fuck is you talkin 'bout?
Damn near 40 record deal in the weed spot
My rap fuck yung'uns up lyrically I am B. Hop
Heheh, I need not to say more
Got a wife so I need not to pay whores
What I recite tight, you need not to say yours
Gun fight, gesundheit, you need ahk to pray more
P! I'm just an old man givin ya
Slaps with my hand that'll crack your mandibula

(Hook x2)
Now hush little baby, don't say a word
Ruck is gon' hit you with the 9 mean you heard
If the 9 mean don't do what it do
I beat the shit to drown and come back for part two

This man murdered the record
Niggas don't want beef like hamburgers in Checkers
P! Lights out, knife out might slash you
Obama turned the White House into White Castle
