[Sample]:
Now the evening has come to a close
And I've had my last dance with you
Onto the empty streets we go

"Streets"

[Verse One] [Natti]:
The World Is A Geto like them Boys said
K.Y. cats die behind thoroughbreds
Get dangled off a narrow ledge
Or get your top pushed back like you give Pez
You bet Tryin' To Get Free like you dead prez
When you found, bound by your hands and legs
Behind currency
Declaring an emergency for euros, pesos, ? and francs
Little Arab cats buggin' throwin' rocks at a tank
A little Swiss Miss with big tits will lace up your drank
With the same shit they gave Jason Statham in Crank
Little Germans just a mack 10 at carryin' shanks
I guess shit don't change except the range of the weapon
If you walk timid, better change how you're steppin'
The pavements a slave ship with chains and whips
If you wanna keep either better close your lips and knees

[Chorus]:
"Streets" {x5}

[Verse Two] [Sean Price]:
I'm a street dude
You a weak dude
Limp wristed, bright colors
You a sweet dude, ex crack dealer who make money through rap
My sket clap squealers and fake frontin' on tracks
In the streets of NY, you and your friends die
Send my, street niggas to murder and lynch guys
I'm a Brownsville nigga for real
P
You a clown still gettin' a deal
Listen
Beat Street, Beat Street, street fighter
On Wall Street in a Street Car Called Desire
21 Jumpstreet, run up on Street Kings
187 when you're hearin' that heat sing
Bamp!
Same street as Mike Tyson was raised
Soon as the sun set the god light up the haze
The streets raised me
What about your moms?
That bitch still in the streets, the streets raised her wrong
P

[Chorus]:
"Streets" {x5}
