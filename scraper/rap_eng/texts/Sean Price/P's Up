Ha, listen

[Hook: repeat 2X]
P's up (P's up) when he was down (when he was down)
Y'all bitch-ass niggas ain't come around
Invisible to these niggas but bust how
Niggas screamin that's my nigga Big Ruckus from Bucktown - P's up!

[Sean Price]
Yeah live from B'Ville, high off E pills
Divine evil, the nine leave you like be still
Uhh, stiff in the box nigga, quick with the shot nigga
Fucked up, cut up, swift with the ox nigga
P - annihilate a nigga in the top ten
Boot Camp! Violate a nigga in some hot Timbs
I rock ACG's too
Guns, banana clips, how this A-P-E do
S-P-E-L-L, very W-E-L-L
Illiterate rappers can't read fan mail
Eatin alphabet cereal but you can't spell
It's all over goodnight now ring the damn bell
BING~! You down for the count

Y'all bitch-ass niggas know what Sean all about
B.C.C. nigga M-I-C, P's up!

[Mike Tyson]
When y'all guys show me love I hate you
Cause I don't like myself, so um
We gotta little um
I gotta catch 22 within my own identity
That's how come I'm very harsh with you sometimes
Cause I'm very tyrranical
Cause I'm not happy with myself
I don't care if I live and die
I don't give a fuck about any of y'all, but I do
