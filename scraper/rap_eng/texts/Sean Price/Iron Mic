[Intro: Sean Price]
Yeah, Weapon X
Murdock, Foundation
Vanderslice on the beat
What up? Sean P

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Yo, stop playin'
It's not what you sayin' it's what you not sayin'
You not sayin' Sean the best
So now you in the pine box, arms foldin' hands across your chest
I testified, the best is I
Sean Price nice and all the rest can die
You petrified, bitch niggas scared to death
I let the four four air out your flesh, P
Underrated, updated, upgraded the flow
I'm mad nice, stop hatin' the growth
Niggas hope that the veteran flop
I put out Monkey Barz now niggas say I'm better than Rock
Niggas act like they better than 'Pac, all eyes on him
They get shot, all nines on them
Listen, stop jockin' the next man
You'll catch a hot one in your head, bam, P

[Interlude: Jon Murdock]
Yeah, Jon Murdock
Let 'em know, kid
Foundation
Let 'em know
Fuck the radio

[Verse 2: Jon Murdock]
I rhyme off axis, car jackin', I'm all action
You're all actin', smash that wack shit that you call rappin'
Cats is half the fraction, I blast through your jacket
We smash shit immaculate, crack packers traffickin'
Crack addicts, it's mathematics with bad habits
Then back at it, I relax laughin' on Craftmatics
That wack shit that you call rappin', I laugh at it
You rhyme and you got mad status like that matters
Drop a Vietnam bomb on your legs, Lieutenant Dan you
Grenaded, amputated, you made it but can't trample
So your times are runnin', shit's dismantled, it's mine to handle
All your plans are cancelled, [?] you when I ran through
Cats start scoping my stash, I blaze clips
I blast, there must be smoke in the crack like Jay Swift
For my staff to come off on a track, it ain't shit
My flow raw, rap fiends coming back like Ma$e did

[Interlude: Jon Murdock & Lex Starwind]
Yeah, for the gusto, motherfuckers
The Outlaw Star, nigga
Foundation, huh

[Verse 3: Lex Starwind]
I'm just fucking with y'all so get your shit right
From the butt crack of dawn to the first stroke of midnight
I'm Eddie Murphy in life, trife, have to park like get right
Since thugs start singing on tracks like Brian McKnight
Luther Vandross or Patti LaBelle
Type to do a little bid, turn faggot in jail
Snake niggas with a rattle gon' battle for self
Get punched in the face, skate, run, tattle and tell
Fuck is y'all niggas sayin'? Fuck is y'all niggas playin'?
Fight clubs turn to peace talks, it's all litigation
We all spit it blazin', flamethrow your flesh agents
Same Soldier X, aiming the tech is the best trainin'
Outlaw [?] part two
Slang white to your wife knowing what the coke gon' do
Get broke off too, you broke, smoke, choke off, you
Get thrown in the [?], get you choked off too
Blackout, tote the clips, you totally bitch
Ain't rodeo, rope be the chips, you totally sick
We focusing shit, my gigawatt voltage overloadin' this bitch
Overdosin', coka smoke with the rich
Lunch at the Ritz, robbing niggas eating brunch with the fifth
My shit glow like [?] ho, get you punched in the lip
Body get beaten, late night I'm probably creepin'
Don't understand my looks then the shotty be speakin'
Click, pow, motherfucker, pump move like a hand job
Truth told from the soul, I never could stand y'all
Bitch niggas perpetrate, fake, hatin' the kid
Buck fifty ox [?] face will get slid
Perfect weapon, weapon perfect when blessin' verses, [?] step his curtains
That shit you talking, don't stress it, address it further
You talking, addressing murder, undressing the Wesson burner
For steppin' in any session with Weapon X, the return of the king
Last draggin' toe tag in the ring
Head shatter from the barrel and the havoc it bring
Slap fire out your face, it's a magical thing
I hate rap and the "talent" it bring, and y'all is wack, man

[Outro: Lex Starwind]
Y'all wack as fuck, man
Sean Price, Jon Murdock, Lex Starwind
