[Intro: Ian Eubanks & Jesse Cash]
We are reborn
Our hope resurfaced, our faith renewed, set us free
We are reborn
Our hope resurfaced, our faith renewed

[Verse 1: Ian Eubanks]
We find safety in the isolation of the catacombs
Absent of light that we can't bear to watch burnout
Desperate souls frightened by the newfound glimmer
Of infinite beauty that we can't bear to lose

[Pre-Chorus: Ian Eubanks & Jesse Cash]
We are reborn
Our hope resurfaced, our faith renewed, set us free
We are reborn
Our hope resurfaced, our faith renewed

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
I'm tired of feeling alone
Surrounded by the company of charming ghosts
I was on my own
The emptiness left when you exercised my haunted soul
And I will never stray from the only constant I've ever known
I am forever grateful to be here with you
You set me free, you set me free

[Verse 2: Ian Eubanks]
Welcome to the light
The fortune of the present yields a prominent fear
Of the resurgence of a crippling past
The contrasting light to every ounce of our darkness emerges
But yields the fear that its life won't last
Welcome to the light
How humbling it is to abandon pessimism and revitalize
Our ambitions with the solace of companionship
Our hope resurfaced, our faith renewed

[Bridge: Ian Eubanks & Jesse Cash]
Emerging from our cave and into the sunlight
We are reborn from the earth's womb
Welcome to the light
Our hope resurfaced, our faith renewed

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
I'm tired of feeling alone
Surrounded by the company of charming ghosts
I was on my own
The emptiness left when you exercised my haunted soul
And I will never stray from the only constant I've ever known
I am forever grateful to be here with you in our translucent forever I am grateful to be here with you
You set me free, you set me free
