[Verse 1: J.T. Cavey]
Take a breath, enter the unknown
Watch your step, it's an escape to the world anew
Flood yourself with colors and senses on overload
Sink inside yourself, watch out for the bottom
Because there's no turning back once it takes control
And you prefer this new creation
The pain exits slowly and there's nothing left but bliss

[Chorus: Jesse Cash & J.T. Cavey]
Floating out at sea, away from reality
It pulls me under, the tide will blow your mind
I'm drifting in and out of ocean dreams
It pulls me under, the tide will blow your mind

[Verse 2: J.T. Cavey]
My pulse is sent into overdrive
Trying to calm my nerves with an unnatural catalyst
Agitator, wave maker, incendiary, excite my life

[Chorus: Jesse Cash & J.T. Cavey]
Floating out at sea, away from reality
It pulls me under, the tide will blow your mind
I'm drifting in and out of ocean dreams
It pulls me under, the tide will blow your mind
Drifting in and out

[Outro: Jesse Cash & J.T. Cavey]
Drifting in and out of reality
Drifting in and out of ocean dreams
Drifting in and out of reality
Drifting in and out, let your mind drift
