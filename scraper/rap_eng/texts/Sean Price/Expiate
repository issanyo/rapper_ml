[Verse 1: JT Cavey]
The miles I've traveled now seem like withered time
Fixated on the rear view when I can't see ahead
For me to view a reflection without corruption
So a past won't dictate a present
Months pass, sitting still, thinking in this box
Where my thoughts are not friendly nor hopeful
This weak mind and body crumble

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Who we were will never be the same
We'll never relive the feeling
Love we made, we let it slip away
And I just can't face it

[Verse 2: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
I can feel it coming on, living inside
Calling me right back to you
My regret meets no resistance
And I endorse this torment to feel
If you exhaust a heart of love
Is the pumping of blood still enough?
Do the limbs go numb?

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Who we were will never be the same
We'll never relive the feeling
Love we made, we let it slip away
And I just can't face it
Who we were will never be the same
We'll never relive the feeling
Love we made, we let it slip away
And I just can't face it

[Verse 3: JT Cavey]
My fictional friend, conducting me piece by piece
I feel your cold blank stare cast on me
I don't ask to be mended
Just understand my words and hear me out
All the passion has faded
All the fire has burned out

[Bridge: Jesse Cash]
How could I see it coming?
This electrifying high that we would grow to resent

[Outro: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
I can feel it coming on, living inside
Calling me right back to you
