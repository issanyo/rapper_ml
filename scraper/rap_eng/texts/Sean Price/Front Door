[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Thanks to ya'll my key flow is mastered
Gangsta bars, a eastcoast rapper getting evolved
Niggas can't get with the God
Got the Gran Torino flow, senior citizen bars
Niggas can rap but I'm better
You put your money down, clown slap a cheddar
Used to rock Pumas like MC Shan
Now I shoot and pop Rugers like no MC can
If niggas was nice in the first place
The New York hip hop wouldn't be in the worst shape
Rapping crazy wack and lazy
Bars with no ho train and slapping ladies
I pop shit and the shot blow
Big time crime shoplifting at Costco's
Pass that Dugat, the pounds
Blast at cat with the stacks
Who got the guap, P!

(Been with it
We should have been dealt with it
Streets keep calling
Been with it
We should have been dealt with it
And my mentality is money over your native
Been with it
We should have been dealt with it
Streets keep calling
Been with it
We should have been dealt with it
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peops who never made it

[Verse 2: Termanology]
I got a mind like no one you could find
Stay humble and wise but I still got a hunger inside
I look in my kids' eyes, know I gotta provide
Put the drama aside but never swallow my pride
I ain't comfortable
Still paid the bills like a month or two
Late, so I ain't trying to show no free love to you
Versus Gzing up cause I got that be reeing up
Freeing up time chilling showing my people love
Keep the drugs, I know that God say only he can judge
Trying to keep my feet above the flames but they creeping up
Used to roll deep as fuck, knuckleheads, we was dumb
Neighbors call polices up, took the Puerto Rican rum
Leave the guns right in the grass and roll the reefer up
Mastermind trying to pass the time so I keep the cup
Keep your luck, I'm trying to control my own destiny
Especially when it come to my flesh and blood next to me
I die for my seeds, never for you fake friends
I ain't your man unless I knew you since the playpen
Take ten minutes of your life, wash your sins away
Sit and pray, beg for forgiveness for what you did today
