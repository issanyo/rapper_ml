[Verse One: Sean Price]
I'm Boot Camp for life
Never worry about the god I get cream
Say I switch teams, get lumped like Mitch Green
Yo, plus I'm MFC for life
Like my Hennessy straight in a glass, no ice
You remember me? Great, if I pass your wife
Remember me through our seed, her ass is trife
Know, I push a hot car
Go in a hot bar
Slap the bartender, go outside piss on a cop car
Niggas tell me "Ruck you'se the bastard type."
I'm like, "Go fuck yourself you hermaphrodite."
Never do a show, a song unless the cash is right
But I give a ho a thong if her ass is tight
Copping an E, yo ma, pop to your knee
Have you knocking my knees, bust a shot on her tee
When I jump out the car, eyes locking at me
Ain't my fault that I'm popular B
Fuck you looking at?

[Verse Two: Jimmy Grands]
Huh
Living next door to the ones that'll leave you leaky
Burn one for Freaky
Burn one for Pun
Burn one for L
Burn one if you like the burn and the smell
Jimmy go on spree and twist about three of the things
Y'all niggas know the songs I sing
That nasty, filthy, underground
Urban, stocking cap over the turban
So whether country
Whether city
E'rywhere
Spit it analog, spit it digi
Uh huh
Watch me, y'all know the god do rhyme
Roll with fam that 9 to 5 and do crime
I'm like no other
I rhyme cause I love ta
And still chop my weed up on album covers
Jimmy Grand review, my preview bumping
Some be the shit, forever dumping
Uh huh

[Verse Three: AG]
Y'all niggas be fronting on A like, "He ain't hot."
Cock it and blast it in they face nigga and he ain't shot
Just a verse of the lead and we never do like them
It's too late in this game to be telling ya, who I am
But I'm the rapper that battled the beast
Same one that married the priest of the nun that carry the seed
We weed addicts that ain't never high
If Doug and Dave tell you they don't pass it, they ain't never lie
So we the ones that lock the cops up
I even rock the drop with the top up
Hear the shots and not duck
AG is the bastard that slaved the master
And I shine when I want just to play with NASA
I'm the tale that wagged the dog
We walk before we had to crawl
I'm the nut that passed the [?]
We the cause and effect and raw as it get
And we that call that's collect that y'all don't wanna accept
C'mon
