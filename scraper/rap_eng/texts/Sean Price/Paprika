[Verse One: Sean Price]
A-yo one for the trouble
Two for the base
Stop basing 'fore you 'cause some trouble in the place, P!
God body with a extra long shotty
Who smoke a dime, a black mixed with a little Jumanji
Niggas get quiet when the God start rhyming kid
You don't need a clock to know what motherfucking time it is
See me now, see me later
Son do juice, hero, and some Now and Laters
Got no time for you motherfucking haters
Rock Izod 'cause a nigga can't afford gators
Good for a fist fight, fuck it we can shoot five
Pull out the sixshooter and commence to shoot five
Word play's bananas, hook like a junky par
Think this shit nice what until you hear Monkey Barz
Underrated, upgraded, updated, emcee
Got your girl on E in my crib butt naked
Yo, you're hating me now
Bitch nigga ranacaning on the shama cow
P!
