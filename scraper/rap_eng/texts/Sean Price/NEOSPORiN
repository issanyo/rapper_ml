[Verse 1: Illa Ghee]
I'm most certainly the black Ron Burgundy
You're irking me
Street surgery
I'm putting bullets in your perjury
Hollow tip mercery
Everyone's here for one purpose
And that's to hear vocabulary Hercules
I'm drop dead handsome
I'm about to hold the rap game for randsome
Spitting like giving Judas a handgun
I'm drawing bullets on paper
I hope you're hearing me because if I can't shoot him for real I shoot him lyrically
Respect me or easily die, I'm life misery
A speck in the media's eye, a public enemy
I'm fire in your pubic hairs
I make Rubik's Cube music
The masters listen to it like a souvenir
Deeper than some scuba gear
Treat bad bitches like last year
I paint a perfect picture with blank stares
In Virginia I'm like "The Blair Witch Project"
I come to your hood and [?] a bitch from the projects
Rotten with those metal objects
The object's to be objective
My talking is the smartest hardest nonsense
Rolling dice with convicts
Sexy something under armpits
The nick bags I sell is blue and orange
I'll body any rapper, I have to it's that important
I'm here to heal rap music boy, I'm Neosporin
On the job extortions
Living amongst the misfortunate
They say my rap flow is like abortion
Kids

[Chorus: Illa Ghee]
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide, listen
Step in my world you're gonna die, feel me
You get in this car you better ride homie, ride out
I'ma kick down the door until I'm inside, check it
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide, listen
Step in my world you're gonna die, feel me
You get in this car you better ride homie, let's go
I'ma kick down the door until I reside, uh-huh

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Uh, that's the shit I don't like
Way your face look I will alter your Walter Cronkite
Sean writes stupid shit, yellow bus status
Metal pluck bastards, I will never tuck ratchets
I ball out blazing, when the four's out banging
Mind changing, I'll change your mind when the god aiming, P!
Trust in allah [?]
I'll fuck up your jaw when I fly off the handle
Peace ock I hock a piece of meat off your face with a gymstar go on a date
Nigga, match made in heaven
He was a good boy, that's the catchphrase of reverend
I clap things at bredren
Tap his pockets, no chips
Got my own money dummy, I'm just for the kill bitch
Sean Insane in the brain
Breakback rap, Bruce Wayne verses Bane, nigga

[Verse 3: Illa Ghee]
Spread a name like butter I utter Jesse James
Pound the pussy of a sexy dame
Voilaters feel a hefty flame
I'm like a heavy chain
One squeeze to your thinker I'll leave a heavy stain
Flow committed suicide a couple years ago
Then it returned with a loosie and some indigo
Still bag a dime inside a Pinto
I'm roughly gentle
My lyrics feeling like I'm pushing kids up out the window
I am the symbol of a knife to your temple
I make the toughest tremble
Fuck is you niggas into?
I rock songs, box a few niggas and kept my watch on
Mathematic music is movies so get your popcorn
I bang on the popular, weak, strong or otherwise
Cringe and the lyrics I'm speaking 'cause I don't socialize
Focus I will bury the rhythm
I build prisms
I don't cut motherfuckers I clip 'em
I'm Blake Griffin

[Chorus: Illa Ghee]
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide, listen
Step in my world you're gonna die, feel me
You get in this car you better ride homie, ride out
I'ma kick down the door until I'm inside, check it
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide, listen
Step in my world you're gonna die, feel me
You get in this car you better ride homie, let's go
I'ma kick down the door until I reside, uh-huh
