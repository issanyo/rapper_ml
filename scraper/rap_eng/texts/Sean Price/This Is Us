[Intro]
You are now rocking with the best

Da Da Da, Da Da Da
Da Da Da, Da Da Da
Da Da Da, Da Da Da
Da Da Da, Da Da Da

[Verse One: Sean Price]
We 'bout to take off right
Ladies and gentlemen I am Sean Price
Money making motherfucker from flipping the off white
Rapping is fundamental but stacking is detrimental
Mixtapes make a lot of money and rapping on instrumentals
Y'all niggas is fucking simple, I'm simply the fucking truth
Truthfully speaking y'all niggas is weak when you speak in the booth
I do what I want to do, you do what you got to do
But you got to do better, unless the letter be dead when you
Incredible lyricist, pugilist with a pad and pen
Punchlines from a predicate felon go tell a friend
I'm not with the fuck shit, I'm not with the duck shit
Ruck spit  [?] on some you can get cut shit
Fuck this, fuck that, fuck everybody
Fuck XXL, The Source and Whitney and Bobby
Fuck VladTV, fuck Worldstar
But don't say fuck me, fuck your girl par

[Hook]
This ain't autotune
This ain't R&B
And this ain't pop
And this ain't rock
This is us, this is us, this is us
I said this is us
This ain't autotune
This ain't R&B
And this ain't pop
And this ain't rock
This is us, this is us, this is us
I said this is us
This us

[Verse Two: Illa Noyz]
Nigga I rep for the 'ville
You get hurt for real
Nigga I'm ill, got them skills, Liam Neeson
Fuck around lay around it's a pugilistic being
Listen broham any weekday I'll make your weekend
Get with the program big bub with them bars you're reaching
Baby par you a weakling with them bars you speaking
And them bars we speaking got me and my squad eating
Listen you were out all season the odds were never even
And it's never been a game, stop playing, stop playing
I come hard brains leave your bedsheets stained
I was born to beat knock, born to heat the block
Born to skeet your girl like [?] off the [?] rock
I do it all and stay funky, lord of the chief rock
Bad Boy like Chrissy Poo can't stop it won't stop
Get my freak on like Missy do soon as the beat drop
With the gat I'll dismiss you crew soon as the heat drop

[Hook]
This ain't autotune
This ain't R&B
And this ain't pop
And this ain't rock
This is us, this is us, this is us
I said this is us
This ain't autotune
This ain't R&B
And this ain't pop
And this ain't rock
This is us, this is us, this is us
I said this is us
This us

[Verse Three: Agallah]
You like the exposure
I'm not a diva runway rapper for sure
But um, the excitement, I love the allure
Is she clean downstairs? I'm not for sure
But um, they love the son they say I'm superfluous
I got swerveolists, I got herbolists
Have you ever heard any word
Then I been murdering
The most magnificent to save me the murderous
The unforgettable, they won't remember you
If ain't me penning you sorry, that's the end of you
At the top like a pinnacle thoughts it's all minuscule
I teach flows to those who've never been to school
Fuck it I'm the principle, I wrote the manual
Your favorite rap animal, ain't hard to handle you
I got phat swag like no other rapper do
Me and Sean Price fine young cannibals

[Hook]
This ain't autotune
This ain't R&B
And this ain't pop
And this ain't rock
This is us, this is us, this is us
I said this is us
This ain't autotune
This ain't R&B
And this ain't pop
And this ain't rock
This is us, this is us, this is us
I said this is us
This us
