[Verse 1]
That's what the fuck I'm talking about
Fuck you talking about
Fuckin' pork in the mouth pig latin
I'm Bin Laden, you're Uncle Ben and your friends laughing
Slap him with the verse, nigga I been rapping
Your men fashion is Ru Paul, the gay blade
How you come with the heat dressed like Dwayne Wade?
I dress proper but the 'sket look mean
My flow, wild tight like Westbrook jeans, P
Listen, listen
Atheist hatin' this God, I'm placin' ya on
Flagrant foul and defensive I'm takin' this charge
Two for the line, yes
Two for the nine, guess
Caught a two for six bitch cause I'm used to the crime, P
We pop shit, you not shit
Come back and wack like Reebok kicks, nigga
True thought, when I rap it the facts follow
You get smacked, ball's double-crossed in the [?], P
