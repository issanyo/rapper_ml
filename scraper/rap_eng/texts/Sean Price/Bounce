[Verse One: Sean Price]
Niggas and bitches, blacks and whites
Fags and dykes, listen to my facts of life
If you a siamese twin then I clap you twice
'Til y'all niggas start acting right
Don't clap,clap alright...
...hahaha...
Yo, if you can't read don't eat Alpha-Bits
Overall they don't amount to shit
Duke bounce to this
On three yo count to this
If you can't read probably can't count for shit
Yo, I'm Sean Price I don't like y'all fools
Fuck a gun I want to fight y'all fools
And you call me a hater
Fuck you and the stuff you got
If I wanted your ass would be snuffed and shot
You know Sean Price, Boot Camp, Ruck and Rock
Tek, Steele, Big Will, my nig Buckshot
Agallah catalog, Analog is real
Fuck that, when Ruck rap niggas best to kneel
Yo, not for nothing but I'm nothing to fuck with
So pop this pill bitch, I heard that you suck dick
Take it back when I first assaulted cherry
Back when St. Johns had Mark and Walter Berry

[Verse Two: F.T.]
Nigga I pee on ho's, OD off dro
Fuck That, A.K.A. Mr. See more dough
You got your business in the street and we all know
Baby, next time you should be more low
Haters talk behind my back saying he won't blow
But shit I smoke a half cost 3-0-0
Man I ain't trusting nobody that we don't know
They shiesty even your wifey could be po-po
Watch my roll up on your blizzy in a drizzy
Pull out the glizzy, run up in the spizzy
And leave with like eight fifty
Spray sixty 'cause I'm straight shifty
Instead of niggas hating on me, niggas better hate with me
I make hot songs but I got a cold heart
I could end your career before it even start
I don't see y'all niggas name when I read the charts
I'll chop you up and let my dog eat the parts
Faggot!
