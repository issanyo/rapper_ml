[Verse 1: Ian Eubanks]
Nurtured by the spirits of the wilderness
The only mother we have left
She is the web in the willow hoop
Like feathers, we just hang in the air
Open arms to a mother's gift
Electric sensations pulsating through our ribs
Breathing life into our dreams while nightmares wear
Wear down the dancing lines of her woven web

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Hanging beneath the nightmare, we fall apart
Hoping you'll call our names, sweet voice we'll follow
In trying to preserve you, we fall apart
We fall apart, restore youth

[Verse 2: Ian Eubanks]
Ghost of the willow trees
The oak, the pines, the bowing mountain peaks
Bring forth the solace of your breeze
Open arms to a mother's gift
Electric sensations pulsating through our ribs
Breathing life into our dreams
The weight of man is crushing me
The weight of man is crushing me

[Interlude: Jesse Cash & Ian Eubanks]
Bring forth the solace of your breeze
From looming pines, through ocean seas

[Bridge: Ian Eubanks]
Oh, Mother, I am breaking down
Oh, Mother, I call to you
Ghost of the willows
The weight of man is crushing me
I am falling apart
Broken into someone less than who I'm meant to be
I am lost
I am lost

[Chorus: Jesse Cash & Ian Eubanks]
Bring forth the solace of your breeze
From looming pines, through the ocean seas
Breathe life into these stagnant feet
Restore the man that I'm meant to be
Hanging beneath the nightmare, we fall apart
Hoping you'll call our names, sweet voice we'll follow
In trying to preserve you, we fall apart
We fall apart, restore youth
Hanging beneath the nightmare, we fall apart
Hoping you'll call our names, sweet voice we'll follow
In trying to preserve you, we fall apart
We fall apart, restore youth
