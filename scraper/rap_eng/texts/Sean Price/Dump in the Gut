[Intro]
That bitch is eating good
Like an infant on the double d titty just getting plump
Because you miscalculated the next to the last pump

[Hook: Sean Price]
Dump in the gut wild from the giddy-up
Dump in the gut wild from the giddy-up
Dump in the gut wild from the giddy-up
Dump in the gut wild from the giddy-up
Dump in the gut wild from the giddy-up
Dump in the gut wild from the giddy-up
Dump in the gut wild from the giddy-up
Dump in the gut wild from the giddy-up

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Out the gate, two pistols
Hold no weight straight fate too simple
Fishburne Larry on some king of New York Shit
Two guns up with my signature walk bitch
Diddy bop pop 'Pac Shakur shit
Got shot once now you're shot some more, bitch (P!)
Enemy of the state
My guns with my bullets be the enemy of your face
Y'all niggas trick in the strip club
Wait outside stick the bitch with your fists
I don't care what you say after
P leave the stage a twelve gauge to a gay rapper
Frank Ocean fan
You slow stroking your (uh) with a lotion hand
I'm a rude boy
Me no lotion, man
Coast to coast so loco with the vocals fam, P

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
S-E-A-N P-to-the-R
I-C-E nigga I see you tomorrow
Talking your shit, the God get to barking the fifth
Leave your face fucked up Pa, Harvey your flipped
Sean Price is the shit, A.K.A. El Dookie
Your [tech ten your rhymes fucking your tooth ache]
Nigga I'm thinking you're frail
The jump man on your door be like tinker bell
[Pawn Dooloo] the Sarge in your arms
The god shoot you
The weapon is voodoo, you Desmond Tutu
I'm not a pimp or a don
I'm the Don Cornelius age raping this song
Fuck around and put two in your head
I fuck around and put two in your head, P
