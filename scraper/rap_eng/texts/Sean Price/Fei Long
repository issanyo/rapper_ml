[Intro]
This is New York
When I left the street
If you heard they were sellin'
What made this particular corner so famous
Was that my quarters, you could dump that quarter out
Go get a quarter of cut, quarter of manite or manita
Take that quarter of manita and put it with my quarter
Blend them together and we would have two quarters
And that's where the innovation was
I was there, I used to be a drug addict
You know I used to do this
I used to be the guy down on the bottom
I used to get these things
And when I got 'em I always wanted to be able to take it home
And use some and then mix it and take the rest out on the streets
And that's why I did it like that
And it worked

[Verse 1]
Come and hang with the bad guy
Been doing my thing since the ring and bad vibes
I'm chit chattin', click clack, nigga your chastised
Found drownin' in blood and brutally baptized
P, on my contra shit
No I ain't, yes I am on some contradict
Bet he shavin' them pies
One stiff shit, you got Betty Davis eyes
Yeah, back of the Maybach
Scratch that, I'm hatchback, rappin' on ADATS
You make songs with Trey Songz
Fuckin' liar, kick fire out you, I'm Fei Long
I'm blam when the thing's drawn
And killed every commando in Rae Dawn Chong
Get out of here, you see these black Chuckers
Stomp shit out of the Diaz brothers, P

[Outro]
Guy came to me, he told me he wanted me
To keep these little brown paper bags, they were capsule heron
I didn't know it at the time
I was making good money with him

He was actually a pretty good student
I had pretty good comments from the teachers as a youngster
He went into the drug business cause he saw
He saw the role models
