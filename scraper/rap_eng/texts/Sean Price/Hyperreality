[Verse 1: JT Cavey]
I disengaged and relinquished the rage
Repressive memories combust into a sky of dust
Oversee my thoughts
Bending time like light through the mist of night
Slipping into serenity
Speeding towards hearts that can't break and steel traps of misdirection

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Weightlessness; separate from this conscious
Alleviation from the noise

[Verse 2: JT Cavey]
Leave it all behind; a master of control
I'd rather it be me than the others wielding the tightrope and chains of woe
Take flight on the wings that aren't impeded by conflict of trust
Gusts powered by passion and retrospective intent
Believe in the purity of your escape

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Weightlessness; separate from this conscious
Alleviation from the noise
Weightlessness; separate from this conscious
Breaking the rhythm of the noise

[Verse 3: JT Cavey]
Please give me space to breathe unblemished atmosphere
Watch me float along this celestial breeze
Give me hope to become one with everything, everything
To understand change as a necessity

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Weightlessness; separate from this conscious
Alleviation from the noise
Weightlessness; separate from this conscious
Breaking the rhythm of the noise
