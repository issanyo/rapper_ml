[Verse 1: J.T. Cavey]
These black holes in my hands, so endless
Swallowing everything that I see
This open wound in my chest, so endless
Devour me
Shameful desire, spreading like a wildfire
You've seen it yourself, devour me
Sickening shameful desire, spreading like a wildfire
You've seen it yourself, you've seen it yourself
My body's breaking down, my spirit is submissive
Broken memories consume me, broken memories consume me

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Distance grows between you and I
Discord unforeseen
Won't you just say what you mean for the last time?
Say what you mean tonight

[Verse 2: J.T. Cavey]
This open wound in my chest, so endless, is rapidly expanding
Broken memories consume me

[Interlude: Jesse Cash]
Time slips away and we're left here writing off the memories we saved
I go far away and leave you here writing off the memories we saved

[Bridge: Jesse Cash]
Return to me, reconciled when we collide
Return to me, with full force in every stride
Life falls fast as time slips away
Return to me, reconciled when we collide
Sometimes our darker side grows hypnotizing, pleading for release
Consciences out of touch, with love subsiding, needing set free

[Outro: J.T. Cavey]
We're writing off memories as time slips away, time slips away
Welcome to the free world, with consciences out of touch
You know when a love so full fades away
You ponder things lost between time and this hollow space
You ponder what you can't replace, and your mind recalls her face
