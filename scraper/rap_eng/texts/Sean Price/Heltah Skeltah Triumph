[Verse One: Sean Price]
Yo, I Sean atomically, beef and broccoli
Timbz on my feet look proper 'cause I just copped 'em B
Sean Price show, you gotta see
The way I rhyme make a nigga wanna pop at me
Get your gun 'cause Martin Luther King got killed on the balcony
At the rally niggas tried to Malcolm me
No I don't give a fuck about who place this is
When you see the nigga point guard, Jason Kidd
Yo, you fucked up now it's taking milly's
To beat your case, straight Jason Williams
Saturday Night Live, Saturday Night Fever
Saturday Night Special, two shots from the heater
Johnny Rambo living off juice and berries
Fix my own gun wounds and I never get married
Step on hot coals, chop cinderblocks
Got your whole block scared now, call the cops
Stomp round and pound footprints inside your chest
Who got it locked? Ruck and Rock duke we are the best

[Verse Two: Rock]
As the world turns I'm heating this shit up
Get it straight like your girl perm
You dumb fuckers never learn
'Til that metal hit you, toast burn
Play your position or be laying in the dirt with the worms
I use my hands, I use my guns, I use a frying pan
To lay your stupid ass flatter than a tire, damn
The weed a jack you got jacked for every fucking dollar
Right before my nigga shot you, right after you hollered
What? If any nigga want it where the fuck he at?
I'm MFG he better bring his motherfucking gat
You niggas herbs you don't clap heat
Your team fake green got me leaning
Like the [?] in a VA
With the bloodclot we Ruck and Ruck
Get off our nuts bop
You think twice you think shot
Jab the bum will have you coughing up a fucking lung
Your baby mothers tougher than you, y'alls a bunch of busters
Niggas is buns

[Outro: Rock]
Heltah Skeltah
You heard that Heltah Skeltah
We the D.I.R.T. nigga
We Da Incredible Rap Team
The unfuckwithable emcees
If you don't believe me test we, we g's
I'm trying to tell you
Heltah Skeltah
Still beat more ass than mom duke leather belt bruh
