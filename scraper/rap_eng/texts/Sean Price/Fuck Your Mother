P!
DZA what's good? Brownsville. Harlem. Let's go
P!

[Verse 1 Sean Price]
I will rock your knot, bitch
Remain emotionless, on some Doctor Spock shit
Robonik, Inspector Gadget with ratchets
Go-go four-four blood in your bath bitch
Listen, I will bash your brain
With a walking stick, bitch felt the wrath of Kane
Bullets make you dance, scoop, and scrap lover
Fuck firearms fam, we could scrap sucka
This nigga said he know 52
Shot up in the elbow, let's see what that shit can do
You whack! P. hatin'
Date rape Satan, initiate Freemason
Niggas take the oath
Go cover bloods from the fuckin' sacred goat
What the fuck that mean?
Sean Price the nicest nigga that's on Buckshot Team
P!

[Break x2]
You fuck with me I'll have her tied up in the crib
Like fuck your mother, she's a stupid little bitch
I banged her about ten times a night, bitch
She ain't nothin' but a little sprite

[Verse 2 Smoke DZA]
Riiiiight!
Kiss the motherfuckin' ring, we on some mob shit
Shit on that pity party, fuck that sob shit
Disrespect you, open neck you, hog spit
Have my man Blizz violate your carcass
Frank Matthews, catch me if you can
Treat a hatin' ass nigga like Spam, ignored him
You ain't cop that piece from the district, you copped that from Fordham
You don't come straight for the re-up, nigga, always be shorten
Always talkin' that bread shit
But when them niggas come out on them big toys
You be on some givin' head shit
Kill yourself, your whole life is whack
Thirty-five and still sellin' crack? Grow up nigga
The other day lil' homie copped a Benz
Call yourself a kingpin and you're still coppin' twenty grams
Fuck outta here nigga, scram, you a peon
You should get peed on
R Kelly style, little niggas trilly wild

[Break]
Good job you fuckin' pricks
It's Sean Price and DZA
Fuck your mother

[Outro]
KushedGod, bitch
