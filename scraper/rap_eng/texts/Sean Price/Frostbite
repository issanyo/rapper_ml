[Verse 1: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
Frostbit fingers
Frostbit fingertips caress the razor's edge
Cold ideals implanting themselves inside my head
Inadvertent gestures given effortlessly by my limbs
Complacency of warmth never sets in
This is an endless winter
One where the air gets thinner
A proclamation to the clement seasons
War without a rhyme or reason
Turmoil is elemental and so simplistic a feature
Though personal and integral, I cannot bear to brace this creature
Brace this creature, this creature
It's becoming deeper
This feeling urges my cliffs steeper
Stepping closer to see the fall
Negligence consumes my all
Have I let go?

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Have I let go of what I am?
I stand here with unclenched hands
Retreating into my own
Enduring this all alone

[Verse 2: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
I scream to remember passion
Unheard emotions in breathtaking fashion
Frostbit fingers
Frostbit fingertips caress the razor's edge
Cold ideals implanting themselves inside my head

[Bridge: Garrison Lee]
We are all the same; unique and indifferent
Living as if this cryptic fever is isolated, it isn't

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Have I let go of what I am?
I stand here with unclenched hands
Retreating into my own
Enduring this all alone, all alone
Have I let go of what I am, of what I am?
