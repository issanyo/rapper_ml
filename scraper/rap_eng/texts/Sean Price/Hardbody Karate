[Verse 1 : Solace]
Shredder shotokan
Discipline the disciples
Give'em the code of arm
Figure the protocols..
On and on I crack a 2x4 with my palm
Shorty cool me with a palm size of her arm
Style of a don, handskill of Dondi
Discipline of Ghandi
Modus Operandi, hard as concrete
Nickname the llama "Dalai"
Want the drama? Prolly box you in
Like Muhammad Ali, Olly... oxen free
Drippin in the white linen
Simpleton vision lack intuitive decision
Root of division isn't what you would think it is
It's spoken word that got blurted and sent the crew to prison
Judas risen, y'all can be an inch apart...
Sharp dart fly similar to ninja star
Spiffy crew on the block 52
Swing swift Ken Griff, when I hit you get the boot, uh

[Chorus]
Hardbody karate
Hardbody karate
Hardbody karate
It's hardbody karate
Ichi

Who
You? (let'em know)
Time-Truth, two dudes from Q-U

[Verse 2: Oprime39]
Roundhouse kicks iron fists clutching the 5th
Puffing a clip triple flip land in a split Like I don't give a shit
Since I was a little kid push-ups with the top knuckles underhand or finger tips
Shotokan discipline hit you with an uppercut
Make em wonder what the fuck
Sounding like if thunder struck
Your muscles gotta be hurting you niggas been gay (BENGAY)
The sensei triple black belt since the 10th grade
Uh.. Haymakers disfigure faces
Lodi doddi catching bodies you catching cases
Split your caco Papo, Arigato -
Stomp the earth leave a size 11 trail of potholes
The Jap letters tatted on your back say that you wack
Mastered the craft ain't no way to counter react
My ninjas chopping manteca like karatecas
To get this bread like Panera black Carerras in Panameras

[Chorus]

Scratches

"Arigato, Sean Price slick like el gato"

[Verse 3: Sean Price]
Yeah... Timeless... P!
Cock fifth and blast
Pop shit and laugh
Hardbody karate, I chop bricks in half
My way or the highway
Sean slay people skills equal the palm may
Flash cannons The Last Dragon the green glow
Smack maggots and hashtag it #DEFEATFOES
P! so Tyson, lost in the night like Peabo Bryson
Shook ya... proof that a young Ruck
Once took ya 'Lo goose with some nunchucks
Be happy I'm on...
Righteous rugby, Levis and Agassi's on
Refund the cash, P spun big gun, reruns of MASH
Mostly solo, mostly Polo
Mostly 4-4's when I'm smoking the dojo
P!

[Outro 2x]
