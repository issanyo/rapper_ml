[Sean Price]
P! Gone!
I rule this rap shit
The best!
Fuck a rhyme before me, fuck a rhyme after
They all low class you classless low bastards
Anyone step foot on my side
I will step to every one of you, my foot in your side
Bullshit aside, niggas bullshit with they rhyme
I'm a pitbull with a full clip grippin' your rhyme
Cross my heart, stick a finger in your eye
I'm a boss I bark sick, stick the nina in your eye
Rude to your force, catch you at the funeral, I
Put two in your corpse, bong bong, two from the nine
Stupid with lines, ain't conducive that my
Spectacular vernacular, fuck a groupie that rhyme
P! I wake up in the morning then I smack the alarm clock
To shaken up your mom my big black in a warm box
I shit on your squad
I'm Sean Price in the City of God
P!
