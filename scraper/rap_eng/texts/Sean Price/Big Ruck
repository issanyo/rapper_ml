[Verse One: Sean Price]
A-yo let me start by saying (say what?)
I'm Sean Price motherfucker I ain't playing (say what?)
You heard me
Catch me in Brownsville projects or Newark, New Jersey
Or North Cackalack with a fifty sack of the hershey
Smoking the trees, watching for cops, scoping at these
Smoking openly, hoping these folks will notice a G
I'm a Nocturnal incognito
Knock on your door bust a shot through your peep hole
I pound the earth, gun down your turf
Who say Big Ruck cool Rock sound like Lurch
Who say Big Rock rule Ruck soft like nerf
Da Incrediable Rap Team team par, sound like D.I.R.T
Yo

[Break: PF Cuttin']
Big shoutout to all you hip hop niggas supporting this real shit right here
You know what time it is
And be on the look out for that Monkey Bar album

[Verse Two: Sean Price]
Let me say it again (say it again)
I'm Big Ruck motherfucker tell a friend (say what?)
Nigga you know me
That nigga Big Rock is my motherfucking homie
We catch cases together, we blast eights at whatever
Yo my son is the weapon of choice
Soon as the nigga speak y'all bitch niggas wet from the voice
P! One of the best you one of the worst
Heltah Skeltah back bitch its it D.I.R.T
Think about it

[Break: Sean Price]
Yeah, we in the house
Heltah Skeltah
Da Incredible Rap Team, D.I.R.T
The new album
Right now you listening to (Donkey Sean Jr.)
We in the house
My nigga PF (Cuttin')
Let's go, peep it

[Outro: Sean Price]
A-yo one for the trouble, two for the base
Stop basing 'fore you 'cause some trouble in the place
