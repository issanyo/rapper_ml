[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Bust the chrons in
Don't say shit until you no responding
The ambiance of a homicidal maniac
The ambulance, word to momma Sean will pop a cap
Big nerd, lyrical miracle bullshit
Sick burn hearse, serial killer with full clips
Phenomenon Sean I tear apart particles the article don
Shoot your papi, heating your bitches, P
Luca Brasi sleep with the fishes
K in your mouth nigga
I'm out all the time you a stay in the house nigga
Ancestors picked cotton, you was a house nigga
Whole life rap, you was dancing to house nigga
Brooklyn's finest, you rewind this Queens right beside us
P!

[Verse 2: Foul Monday]
Rock 'em to sleep like a lullaby
Eat your food like I seasoned you for a southern fry
Other guys realize they idolize
How I modernize music and use it to monetize
Privatize pussy, marvelize rookies
Organize a homicide so pimping don't push me
Pop a bottle for my people, party like we made it
Dutch's full of purple like a pocket full of payment
Yo I'm loving how I'm living
Betting my recliner chair
Sicker than your average but I don't need Obama Care
Rougher than a European porn star's vagina hair
I suggest, yo best suggest you get out of here
Best that ever passed through?
Foul Monday is the answer when they ask you

[Verse 3: Royal Flush]
They say a deadman never gonna talk when he get popped
Everybody got guns, now they got gun shots
Hustle on back blocks as DA's and Feds watch
Snipers on the roof, that's a headshot
Watch the Redbox, talking to Red Foxx
Want to rump nigga, you getting you're dred locked
Big shut the fuck up, you getting your man shot
Used to smoke the tai from evergreen and hancock
Started from my momma's kitchen watching them grams drop
