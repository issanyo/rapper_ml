[Verse 1: Sean Price]
I'm a junkie too
My friends are all the same, monkey see monkey do
Confrontational, fuck with P, fuck with who?
Extreme with it until all extremities turn blue
Suffocate til you defecate in your blue jeans
Old sheriff in town, crown the new king
Allahu Akbar, Allah you not, pa
God gifted with me with rap, Allah who got bars?
P! I told you the last time
Bar-for-bar the best, yes I'm in my rap prime
I dare niggas to say something slick out their mouth
I will air something, your bitch, four-fifth in your mouth
I hate it, every day Sean AR spit
Creative, no course play with JR Smith
If you can't take the heat, I think you know the rest
This is live and not a test
Court is in session
