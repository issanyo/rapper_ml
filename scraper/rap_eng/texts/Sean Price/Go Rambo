[Hook: Sample]
I know a man who's always right
Says he's never wrong
But one day when he needed his strength
He found it all had gone

[Intro: Sean Price]
That's why I can't stand your ass now
P!

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Uh, go Rambo
Four-four clap at them, open your toe sandals
Oh no, the African rapper, the dope sample
I told y'all cats when I'm focused, your flow shambles, P!
I hit 'em harder with the large trey
Bullets small but forward Iguodala the Andre
Gun in my hand, the knife in the other
Whichever one of them strike, say good night to your lover
Lead pop, got mom dukes in a headlock
No exaggeration duke, I'm tight with your mother, P!
I don't listen to most rappers
Most rappers suck, fuck, Ruck is the toast clapper
Butter your bread, the gun to your head
I eat, shit, sleep, murder, gun in my bed, P!
Swing swords on the gunner pound
Sean is the king, the lord of the underground
Salute
Fuck outta here, P!

[Verse 2: Illa Ghee]
Pointing guns at my baby mother
It's all gravy, throw the 80 at my baby brother
Undiscovered, discuss gun squeezing, I hush hush the demons
I'm the definition and the meaning
On the scene, News 7, make reality dream wait
I make fatality scream hate, so hate and say no more
I'm spitting disrespectful from an ancient sword
I ex-a-sketch then I X you like the angel's hoard
When I rewind, see I seen it before
So decline like mine, put the nine on the floor
Peep in mind, I don't mind to put your mind on your door
Mano y mano, couldn't stop the reign with the poncho
Illa the animal, I'm straight from the Congo
Flow as a tornado and this cradle in the condo
Bottom line, sucker niggas, keep your distance
Like a chess game, Illa keep a angle like a bishop
Illa

[Verse 3: Head I.C.E.]
Mice say cheese, for the bread, it's all ground beef
He probably ran to police before he found me
Always swim with the sharks, well then I harpooned them
He ducked to water and swam, I got to part two 'em
With the fish full of scale, I got to cook something
Ill and Sean got a sale but there's some jooks coming
I'm too good for the streets, I got my bachelor's
I mean what's good with the beef, I got my spatula
Dead bodies tell tales and open cold cases
So put them back in the fridge 'cus just the toes gray
Bum, go Rambo
Tank and plane got tape on both handles, bao
Hit 'em from the land or above
I handle a grudge so bitch will put a hand in my tub
ICE, chill or be cold without a winter day
I kill stars at the end like the movie Grey
Wolf
