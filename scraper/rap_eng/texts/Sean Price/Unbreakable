[Intro] [Magnum Dollarz talking]
Uh, it's Magnum Dollarz, Original Minds. OJ Loopz on the beat
This joint feel like a flashback. Takin' me back to my younger days
When I first found hip hop

[Verse One] [Magnum Dollarz]
A young boy when I picked up that tape
A psychic vision, it's like I peered into my fate
It was set
And to this day it's been that way
The bond was made and I'll never wander astray
And now from no pain and love is what keeps this strong
The passion makes my heart and soul seep into these songs
All along I was programmed
I blended with rap the same way old schools plays do with the pro keds
So understand ?
It's cool to have a job but I ain't gettin' no benefits
Workin' overtime
Goin' over my rhymes
Sometimes they too deep, don't sink into they minds
So I would find our relationship was being strained
Cause I won't spit no fairy tale rhymes to get in the game
It's insane but the flow is unmistakable
And the bond that we do is fuckin' unbreakable

[Hook]
"Come and take me, here I am
I've been waitin', here I am
Take me, and I'm not afraid to go"
It's unbreakable
"You and me are going to heaven" (It's you and me)
"And I'm not afraid to go"
It's unbreakable
"You and me are going to heaven" (It's you and me)
"You and me are going to heaven"

[Verse Two] [Sean Price]
Yeah, I love rap but I hate the game
Matter of fact bitch what's my name?
P
Rememberin', sellin' crack, singin' +Check Tha Rhime+
On point P? All the time, check the nine
Big Daddy Kane, Juice Crew, niggas was styled out
Cuts in my eyebrows, damn I wild out
Went to Union Square saw Doug E and Rakim
Too young to hawk but bet you I got in
Who's the best beat box, Buffy or Biz?
Me duke? I love Doug E but they both got biz
Yo I once robbed this nigga for some cash at the bus stop
And soon as I left they left me a piece like Chubb Rock
Went from, super rhyme to super nine
Sellin' nicks broke bitch, want two for nine
Listen
I'll take the short you take these thoughts
Store 'em in your memory bank and thank me for it
P

[Hook]

[Verse Three] [Magnum Dollarz]
Some years later and the skill some people notice
Now chasin' a dream, the kid is gettin' focused
The bars tight as ever ain't no way to be torn
Out comes the chain letter, Magnum Dollarz is born
It's the start of somethin' epic
The way he spit on a record
Is years beyond the level, that's what people expected
But he's still gettin' neglected
No love from above
So he drops "The Future Of Rap: Volume One"
They start payin' attention, these niggas wanna listen
Cause they see the scope of life and share with the same vision
? 100% real
No gimmicks at all, 100% skill
Not close to deal but it ain't no time
So I start my own, I bring to you Original Minds
It's the grind
Now we on a sub
We got a great relationship
We won't break for nothin'

[Hook]
