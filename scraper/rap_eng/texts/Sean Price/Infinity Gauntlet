[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Forever P flaunt shit
Hand full of stones, the infinity gauntlet
I war with broke niggas that can't afford shit
Raw shit, four spit, left in the morgue stiff
Cream Filas go with the velour bitch
Gear's gorgeous, footwear is enormous
I'm waving the hammer, I'm banging the fire
I'm David Banner, I'm changing the tire
You know me homey, the hoodie black
Phony, Hobie Josie and the Pussycat
Ain't nothing new to the speech bitch
Beat a nigga down like the Jews did Jesus
Passion of Christ, no it's the passion of Price
Backwards, stabbed with a gun, clapped with a knife
P! Nigga to say what Sean say it take ten Jay-Zs and 3000 Andres

[Verse 2: Starvin B]
Yeah back alley madness
Moving with the balance of Bobby Valance
To showcase intoxicated talents
Vultures retract talons when the culture is here
And the vocals is on point like a Doberman's ears
Choke 'em with fear, I ain't been sober in years
Got a demon over my shoulder that be holding my beer
Here's to another year beat killing and that's bust
Flying off the top like a Mexican masked up
You know I'm trying to double my last buck
Unfuck-with-able hustle that I just can't pass up
Been munchin' in the dungeon when the beats is bumpin'
I don't speak on beef, I sink my teeth in something
You trying to leak, come see me on the streets or something
Psycho Les on the beat and Sean P is disgusting
