[Intro]
(P!!!!)
Word up, Sean P, (BODY), P-Body
"Knowhatimsayin', I mean this is me"
Introducing P-Body, 9th Wonder, P

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Aiyo the arm-leg-leg or arm, head Megatron
Decipticon Sean duke you know my name
Fuck around and send your ass back from where you came
Back in the dirt, back in the earth, back off my turf
Clap cowards, black power, black, red, green and shit
Smoke sour, sell powder cuz crack-heads be needin shit
Pssh, I'm in the hotel with ganja
Dope needles, Don Cheadle, Hotel Rwanda
Go get your partner, Rock ain't here nigga
Go get your momma, my cock right here
I got this here, it's a different doctrine here
Fuck if the cops aware, you get popped in here
Listen, I fear no man but God
Matter fact, duke I am the God, P-Body
Four eyes, two arms and three shotties
Got shit on lock like Irv and Gene Gotti
A mean mami from Puerto Rico who sell pedico
And for the right price princess will pop at your people
P-Body
"Knowhatimsayin', I mean this is me"

[Hook: Rock]
P!!! Pound for pound perfection, and punch potholes in pretenders
Pay attention it's gon pop off
Body get beat, embody the street
Anybody get bodied when its beef, introducing P-Body

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Supposed lie to cops and tell the truth in the booth
Instead you tell the truth to the cops and lie in the booth
Fucking backward ass rappers get smacked with the gat happily
Boom-shack-shack and the cannon backup your faculty
The left hook'll shatter your chin
Similar to Darryl Dawkins when he shattered the rim
Niggas get mad at my Timbz and my thousand dollar jeans on, yeah
Boot Camp, bitch recognize my team's strong
Nigga, kneel down, kiss the ring
R. Kelly a verse when I piss on your sixteen
Nigga rap Prime Minister, pa, President P
Pop off my pistol partially parched pass the tea
Truth be told, God top rankin' I'm not thinking
Saying whatever, love it when I put it together
Listen, y'all bitch niggas probably Punani
I bust a shot, you start running for mommy, P-Body

[Hook: Rock]
P!!! Pound for pound perfection, and punch potholes in pretenders
Pay attention it's gon pop off
Body get beat, embody the street
Anybody get bodied when its beef, introducing P-Body
Partnah, we practically pioneered this position
You punks pop shit, he popping the heaters
You gon see a body, somebody gon be a body
Somebody gon' probably need a body transplant
P-Body

[Verse 3: Sean Price]
Listen this is the BCC, and double D
In the 2k6, we make hits
We make chips, I'm always stacking my dough
Can't be the "Brokest Rapper You Know", P-Body
Yeah, get money or get lost
Or get your shit split, we lickin the fifth off
This ain't no gangsta rap
How many muthafuckin gangsters rap, listen
I mean, truthfully you might think you that
But overall duke I think you wack, P-Body
The name is new, the face the same
The judge is wack, the case is lame
I love the rap but I hate the game
Matter fact, bitch, what's my name, P-Body
