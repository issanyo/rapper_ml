Something that can make you do wrong, make you do right..

[Sean Price]
P! (P!) Yo
I'm back in the game, y'all motherfuckers whack in the game
Snatch off your chain, clap with an inaccurate aim
Aim for your head, fuck around and clap up your legs
Aim for your legs, and fuckin shoot the back off your head
Ass backwards, backward-ass rappers get slapped stupid
For sayin Ruck ain't showin no love, smack Cupid
Sean do it stupid, the koof of the conduit
Cut the cop ear off, he bleed when he bluetoothin
Uhh, I spit various spewbilarious bars
Y'all motherfuckers sweet blueberry in jars
Word to Elijah, beat a nigga down to attire
Take a brick, and beat him down til' he retire - then {*5X fading*}

[Ruste Juxx]
Aiyyo, fuck with me! My bullets won't graze
Sink your boat when it splash through ya waves
Sean P is Megatron, Juxx is Starscream
Chokin on a jar of green, bitch my bar is mean
Hardly seen, Hollow Man in the hood
You run shit? Niggas told me how you ran in the hood
When I was growin up, them niggas would test me (what?)
I put in that twerk and made motherfuckers have to respect me (bang!)
Now them niggas ridin to rep me (yeah)
Bitches used to diss me, now them hoes slidin and sexy
Fuck subliminal I'm speakin directly to you son
Now tell your moms come check me
Fuck around and hit her with that stepdad dick
She'll be tryin to move me in and kick yo' ass out quick
Kimbo Price I blow with the Ruckus
