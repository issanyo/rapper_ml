[Verse 1: J.T. Cavey]
Tossed around the idea of stepping off the edge
Hoping my fall lands into a familiar place
A familiar face: can we leave this space?
It reminds me of all my mistakes
Bite my tongue, vision spins
Living life from the cutter's skin
Sent to be an ungrateful son
Can't you see my breath is gone?
Bury my head to hide from reality
I'll make a new name for myself, I'm on my own
I just hope I have the strength to move and show fortitude
Bite my tongue, vision spins
Living life from the cutter's skin
Sent to be an ungrateful son
Can't you see my breath is gone?

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Just let me sleep tonight, tonight
When I only feel safe inside

[Verse 2: J.T. Cavey]
Shadows cast and dance slick, these walls expand quick
With every strike, I shudder at the wake
Rippling through my drifting mind
What if I knew the journey this whole time?

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Just let me sleep tonight, tonight
When I only feel safe inside
I only feel safe inside
Just let me sleep tonight

[Bridge: J.T. Cavey]
So I need to be saved? Do I want to be?
I don't want to be the shell of what these people see

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Just let me sleep tonight, tonight
When I only feel safe inside
I only feel safe inside
Just let me sleep tonight
