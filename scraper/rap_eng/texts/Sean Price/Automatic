[Brad Strut]
See it's funny how this life spin
Only ever seem to get it when I write sin
With a regret I feel the light dim gradually
Step into the darkness and do it with a rye grin
The name's Bradley

[Verse 1: Bradt Strut]
I'm up early, standing weary in the cold steams
It's 7:30 - check it out I'm knocking on
I'm getting dough is the theory in full effect
And functional, on time, punctual, the velvet parker's strung
Cos paying dues is a life time mission
A pipeline vision in a strife-torn prison
My thoughts choked and dreams broke and no wishes
Ever coming truer, I refuse to be restricted
The way's think - especially when you play this
And realise you're a slave to chasing the pay slips
Wanna be wasted in places I can't pronounce
Wanna be faceless to strangers, a charming lout
From Terror Australis, I'm known to rock hardest
On a microphone I'm a hot artist
So get the party people plastered, year's are now mastered
Spears in the stars and sun, the town bastard

[Hook: Brad Strut]
You see it's funny how this life spin
Only ever seem to get it when I write sin
With a regret I feel the light dim gradually
Step into the darkness and do it with a rye grin
The name's Bradley
Spark it with a small flame
To the people playing in it yo it's all game
To the people on the planet yeah it's all pain
Name's Bradley and strut be my forte, do it always

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Aiyyo Kinger from Jack, smoke black from green weed
Who came in the game, filled up quick, Kareem Reid
Sean Price a mother fuckin' bastard beast
With a bullet that touch kids like Catholic priests
Clap you peeps, smash your fleet, trap your neice
In the corner, do what I wanna - her ass is sweet
Thug African, drug trafficing can make you a dough
Coke habit in the Sahara, I'm making it snow
Got a habbit from grabbin rashins and making no blow
Float Joe rapidly running, too steep and could fall(?)
That's when I'm packing em' down, smackin em' down
Clappin' around with a '44 Magnum to pound, blast it around
Snatchin' the crown, Sean Price is the King
Get on your knees bitch! And kiss the ring - motherfucker

[Hook: Brad Strut]

[Verse 3: Brad Strut]
I spent 10 years, prime of my life smoking on cigarettes
Blend beers with Bundaberg Rum and still I didn't get
Having my moments, I'm a bad drunk
Brad Strut, on me's the onus time to stand up (brand new!)
Finding the purpose, I'm a fan still (Brad Zill)
You had your chance but didn't grab on
Had you taken a minute just to scope out
No doubt you would have witnessed I'm a low-down profile
So here we go now sitting with a pen in hand
No expectations, waiting patient for my 10 grand
Me and my friends man dismantle microphones
Devise your best plan to even try invoke
You better write the quote "chiller than a pandemic"
This man sent me, time to kill it - this is fantastic!
My brand's manic, you stand in the paddock
I seperate the herd with my words automatic
