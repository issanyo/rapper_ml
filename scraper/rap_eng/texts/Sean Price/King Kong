P! Yeah
P!

[Sean Price]
Yo...
Aiyyo, millionaire monkeys microphone mix masters
Make money from music, the fo'-fifth faster
Slap a, bitch boy knock his tooth out his grill
Sean Price be the truth in the 'Ville, listen
If ya, knock on my door I'm cockin the four
Free to escape from the law like Assata Shakur
For a dime of crack you can put your cock in a whore
Kinda works when you rockin' on tour, listen
Groupie girls wanna lick on your dick
Groupie guys wanna get in the flick, I'm like - FUCK YOU~!
Give me some chips, overall they like "Sean's so ill"
Who you think you is, Ron O'Neal? (YEAH!)
Allahu akbar pah scar pa on the grill
Fake fuck's face cut when they fuck with the real
Mighty Flow Young, so dumb, guns is drawn
Calamity, all your family, your son is mourned, one

(I punch you in your face nigga~!)
(Who the fuck you talkin to, who? I smack the fuck outta you)

[Hook: Rock]
Crush kill and destroy them with savagery, catastrophe
Dump steel, let it roar and we smashin through your ave and fleet
Run you still can't avoid it, the spazzery, the agony
Battle you bitch bastards, we king kong your whole faculty!

[Sean Price]
Aiyyo, Sean Price, Boot Camp best
Gimme the #2 pencil, watch me take the test
Shake your set, break your neck, competitors flee
Who the fuck rhyme better than me? Nobody-body
Dutch in my ear, Olde E in my palm
I Freddy Krueger your face, Michael Myer your moms
You botherin mine? That's when I'm sparkin the nine
Pull out the thing, flame on like 'clobberin' time!'
Fan-tastic flow, connect the concepts
Broke niggas with new kicks, that's my projects
My man like "Ruck, you ain't reachin the kids"
I stuck my hand out and three-pieced his wig
I'm, doin my thing, you new to the game
Don't hate, "Celebrate" pa, Kool and the Gang
I don't have a big crew, just Dru and Starang
And a couple of loose screw dudes boostin' your chain
P!

(Fuck you don't know! I smack the shit out of you)
(Brownsville nigga, what the fuck wrong with you man?)
