Sometimes I get so lonely, just thinking by myself
X2

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
Put my hand in my pants and then I'm scratching my balls
Irritation, Gold Bond Powder, medication
Twenty pair of kicks, I sent them shit to Haitians
Jacques Cousteau cop rocks of blow
Crush it, get dusted then I got to go
P, I'm not your average Joe
I'm a savage with bad manners, the hammers that blow
Type to tote the Glock and use gats
You the type to vote Barack cause dude's black
And I don't give a fuck about a color
Eight baby mothers, give a fuck about a rubber
P the boss, see me floss
Blowing heaters off when they gave them Peter Tosh
Nigga I smack goons naked
Sean Price, up nights playin Black Moon records

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]
Priceless paragraphs get written with expensive pens
Walk through fences, move relentless, drop extensive gems
Probability's a motherfuckin' profit
Run with broke niggas, won't be money in your pocket
Not afraid of heights son, but I'm scared of falling
So I'mma stay fly forever nigga keep balling
Respect my elevation, I'mma let the wind blow me
Fuck acceleration I don't need gowns to fly
Look at my dress code, nigga I'm passed the sky
I'm so tomorrow bitch, fuck with me next year
You love me and it's scary, your fresh fear
I am that, Mac-10 rap pop side street jargon
3 for 50, 2 for 35, let's bargain
Master of the ocean, my closet's the aquatic center
Feisty firearm, pistol with a violent temper
Mature palette, crab meat in the guacamole
Beggars at the bottom like to say the top is lonely
Keep my music raw just like my blue points
Each week I'm banging out new joints
It's real dick, bottles in ice baths
Bitches with nice calves
Whole chrome toaster we might blast
Queens nigga, every day is a food and wine festival
Pearl white flights and the vegetable
We saw that, I feel naked when I service my watches
Fly shit, my vehicle's spotless
What's good nigga
