[Verse One]
Ayo I thought, who the fuck told you to think jerk?
You're funny style, bitch nigga rocking a pink shirt
Goof ball niggas
Doof ball niggas
Cross dressing, funny style, Ru Paul niggas
Here's the latest duke, peep the truth y'all niggas
Biting my shit, till the god shoot y'all niggas
Yo, Sean Price put a cock in the throat
Playing Aaliyah song rocking the boat
Yo, I'm a grown man
I'm a stone man
You a six minute Dougie Fresh on the phone man
Yo, one of the best you one of the worst
I put this gun to your chest leave blood on your shirt
Niggas acting all hard but they fake as shit
Had me gassed till I saw them niggas taking shit
Duke ya, one of the worst, I'm on of the best
I put this gun to your shirt leave blood on your chest
Nigga

[Hook]
You have hanged
(Hanged yourself)
Or he will bang
(Bang your health)
It's Ruck The Irrational bitch
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse Two]
Peep the motherfucking tools of the trade
I run with Puerto Rican niggas that fool with the blade
That's a stereotype, I can never stereotype
No radio songs for me, stereo type
You a motherfucking son of a bitch
Always telling the cops, like your pops you a son of a snitch
I don't be running with motherfuckers who be running they lip
Percolate with the pound and get crunk in this bitch
And I don't give a fuck about half of the rappers that's out
Half of the rappers that's out need to be slapped in they mouth
First of all, what the fuck y'all niggas rapping about?
Ray Ray, KeKe Bobo, what you yapping about?
I'm one of the best
Y'all bitch niggas one of the worst
I put this gun to your chest leave blood on your shirt
You one of the worst
Sean Price one of the best
Put some blood on your shirt with my gun on your chest
Nigga

[Hook]
Ayo
Reign Of The Tec
Cock back, aiming a [?]
Grace the lame, felt the flame on his neck
Battered and bruised
Bum bitch, shattered and used
Date rape, great ape pa, making the news
Add the B.C. Michael Jackson and Soloman Grundy
Scare the kids for the love of the money
You can run, you can hide but death is near
You ain't hearing me right
Since I left this air
Yo, this is an Official Joint
Don't believe me, come watch the pistol point
Up in your grill
Sean Price up in the 'ville
Told y'all motherfuckers to just chill
Y'all ain't listen

[Hook]
