[Verse One] [Sean Price]
Yo
He cuts, scratch, transforms with finesse
My dude Rev is the +King Of The Decks+
Do the knowledge for real
Motherfuckers should acknowledge the skill
'Fore I .44 your face and demolish your grill
Listen
I ain't a DJ but I cut and scratch
With a jib star razor, what's fuckin' with that?
So hey
Mr. DJ
Play that song
Watch how you speak 'fore I have to spray that...BOONK
DJs break records and make them hits
Corny records get broke we don't play them shits
I
Use your CD to crush up the kush
While you try to pay the DJ to give it a push
Naw
No payola ain't the way of a soldier
Work on your craft, your motherfuckin' flow is trash
Sean Price is the best of the best
With my man Revolution +The King Of The Decks+
P!

[Verse Two] [Tash]
While I'm deep up in the cut up in the city I'm bred from
You couldn't find CaTash if I left a trail of bread crumbs
Redrum is rampant with these niggas tryin' to match me
So it's not a lot of places in the city you can catch me
So scratch me if you can while I +Cram To Understand+
How Rev's hands move faster than the trains in Japan
Spy's go deep to peep CaTash's monopoly
Stalkin' while I'm walkin', gotta kick 'em off my property
CD to the wax, the wax's to the minidisc
I bogart the microphone like, "Yeah, nigga give me this
Mic check, one three, one three."
When the Revolution starts where the fuck you gon' be?
See me?
I'mma be by the bar postin'
Look at y'all motherfuckers through my glass like gold fish
You got the best from the west
Catastrophe and Revolution
