[Sean Price]
George Papadopoulos
Monotonous botanist apocalypse
Proper shit
Chocolate doctor that doctored the document
Drop a bitch, pop a clip, stop it bitch
P!
I'm one of the best, whoever is better
I bet a buck-fifty, you can't fuck with me
The loud sniper, the crowd hyper
The tall can is spam in ya fam, Ham
The damned now cypher
Give Sean love, give Sean drugs
Defiant, I slam giants, Big John Studd
.38 long drawn, and pop at a perpetrator
Rae Dawn Chong, get the chopper with Schwarzenegger
The man so disciplined
Spaced out black, Lando Calrissian
You see Sean bomb cats
Scientifically, 3-2-1 contact

[Illa Ghee]
Deciphered the cypher
I write with a lighter
To these biters
See I fight with the fire
Like Pryor
My prior is barbed wire, The Wire And the drug supplier
Sapphire, I'm the Messiah
Black Meyer Lansky, my vocals are like cotton candy
Wrestled with life, turned savage, I'm like Randy
My culture I cultivate, condemn what I contemplate
I castrate the whole North America's bodyweight
Crumble ya jaw, and I shatter ya lobby
I'm Bobby Fischer, bar for bar, and body for body
Illa crazy as a kamikaze human molly
Pissin' on the paparazzi, have you Luca Brasi
I got the aura of a mazerati hotta totty
Infuriate the mechanism of ya social posse
This is written homicide with a mission
This is diction, raisin' the bar and erase suspiscion
Illa!

[Royal Flush]
Look
Flush is a smooth operator
And still run in ya crib with the hammer, annihilate ya
And violate ya, throw ya body off of the skyscraper
I want paper, seen teams fall for
In one trade, I keep a black mask like Darth Vader
I be right back, like the terminator
And keep a Mac on me like bitches that wear make-up
Ya lil' stupid motherfucker, get ya weight up
You eatin' out a bowl get ya plate up
And I ain't tryna let the FBI take us
With more jewelry on my neck than Jacob
And still be on an island on a VI with a Razer
I started from the projects
Now a nigga own acres
Staple ya center, like you played for the Lakers
Shit man I'm what a boss look like
Got too many guns in my life just to fist fight
