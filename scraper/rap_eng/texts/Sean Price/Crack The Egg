It go R...U.C.K
32 years old, receding, I need a toupee
Got a bitch in Washington Heights named Guadalupe
She suck dick and sell nicks in front of New Way
Bodega, the alpha the omega
From beginning to end, Ruck is never ya friend dude
Understand pa we straight enemies
Keep riffin' I'll slip the clip in and throw ten of these
David Ruffin of rap, I got a gun
When I bust you feel stuck in the trap
Nowhere to run, rat in a maze
I throw the gat to your braids
Blow the hair off your side now take you back to a fade
This ain't the same Ruckness from back in the days
I'm older now...and that was a phase
The weed smoke we toke mostly black and some haze
Boot Camp for life, I'm ready to rock
Collapse on the stage

[Hook: Mr. Eon] {x2}
This is boom bap music
We the conductors, instructors with something destructive to touch you with
Is you ready? I was born to wreck this
Corner store filthy cause the natives are restless

[Sean Price]
Ayo, you ain't as nice as you thought you was
You think too much, your whole flow stink you suck
Quit rappin'
You need to lift some weights
And come back as a rapper's bodyguard to get that cake
There's a lot of motherfuckers who ain't get that break
Heroine flow, withdraw, get that shake
I got cops on my back like, "Get that ape"
Spin around, bongk! get that eight
Motherfucker
