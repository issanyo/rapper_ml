[Verse One]
Ayo
Vegetarian niggas don't wanna beef with
Sean Price, ain't no secret on how I keep it
Handle it like gentlemen and get into some street shit
Beat shit outta ya quick fast, feel the heat rip
If that can happen to you then imagine what your peeps get
Cool cats like Heathcliff leaving your meat split
I was born bad bitch, you know how the fuck the streets get
Creep with niggas out of town and get your Jeep hit
Yo
Y'all niggas ain't stopping me now
Bank is what duke? Like I was down
Bitch niggas stop with a bang
Bedstuy copping your dame
Take a cab to Tonkin and see what's popping with Tank
Y'all niggas ass cheeks, y'all need to stop with the pranks
Before I come through and lock in the safe, Glock to your face

[Hook]
Yo
You fucking with the all time greats
Sean Price about to create an all rhyme state
Y'all niggas is all fake, balling with small cake
When I blow up, don't show up, niggas is all snakes
