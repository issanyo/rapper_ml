[Verse 1: Jesse Cash]
I've watched a lot of things crumble in my hands
Falling through my fingers like grains of sand
When the hourglass tips over on its side
Does it create infinite moments or leave us trapped in time?

[Pre-Chorus: J.T. Cavey]
Loath, disdain, pity, regret consume me and I shut down
Dissolving internally with no silver linings to any clouds

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
I disassociate with everything I know
Drowning out, losing control

[Verse 2: Jesse Cash & J.T. Cavey]
My detachment permeates to everything I know
Refill the sands and balance the scales or let me go
I'm becoming everything that I defied
Withdrawn emotions, I've built a shell and I live inside

[Chorus: Jesse Cash & J.T. Cavey]
I disassociate with everything I know
Drowning out, losing control
My detachment permeates to everything I know
And I'm drowning out, losing control
I'm becoming everything I defied

[Verse 2: J.T. Cavey & Jesse Cash]
Slowly withering, there seems to be no way out
Refill the sands, balance the scales or let me go
Loath, disdain, pity, regret consume me and I shut down
Slowly withering with no silver linings to any fucking clouds

[Chorus: Jesse Cash & J.T. Cavey]
I disassociate with everything I know
Drowning out, losing control
My detachment permeates to everything I know
And I'm drowning out, losing control
Losing control
