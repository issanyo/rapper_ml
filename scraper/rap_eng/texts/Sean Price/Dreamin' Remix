[Intro: 50 Cent]
Niggas crazy (keep on dreamin')
Think they gon' catch me slippin' (keep on dreamin')
I'm on point, nigga (I said keep on dreamin')
24/7, ya heard?

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Every day I dream I see you dreamin'
I cock my strap, I see you schemin'
I want you to try me, nigga, I'm fiendin'
To pop my shit then forever you sleepin'
When robberies done improperly
It turns into murder one, one, one
Move properly or get dropped, see
Come at me wrong and you're done, done, done

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
No two-face or mean mug, no mask, no gloves
Get you in my peripheral, I'm tearin' you up
I'm watchin', you probably think my eyes wide shut
I'm waitin' for you to cross the line and get fucked
I lean in a Lotus, take off like a rocket
Got your bitch outta pocket, my hustle, you can't knock it
Got paper like Citibank, nigga, you need a loan
Got a brain, use ya brain, or get ya brains blown
Watch my watch tick tock and get popped
See my chain gleam scheme
And get met with the beam, nah mean?
I'm not a freshman, I'm a senior, yeah, head of my class
I'll put a hollow tip head in yo' ass
You tryna jam me thinkin' I'm candy
Ain't nothin' sweet, I run the streets with all sorts of heat
You tryna eat, try elsewhere, my presence is felt here
You won't need wealth here, your ass'll get melt here
Nigga, yeah

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Every day I dream I see you dreamin'
I cock my strap, I see you schemin'
I want you to try me, nigga, I'm fiendin'
To pop my shit then forever you sleepin'
When robberies done improperly
It turns into murder one, one, one
Move properly or get dropped, see
Come at me wrong and you're done, done, done

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Ya niggas ain't maintaining, ya niggas is man-tanning
Black face, smack taste, I'll chew on your man standing
Fuck who you next to, nigga, I'll wet you
Splash vest, crash test, guess what this gat do
I'm getting upset, duke, guess I'm the Madd Rapper
First born on the horn saying, "yo, dad, slap 'em"
Fuck all these fuck-niggas, this is big Ruck, nigga
I'm a boss, you a ten off every buck, nigga
Ruck is a tough rapper, I got a Dutchmaster
Three dice in my hand sippin' a nut-cracker
I got the bank stop, you think broke, bitch, I think not
Twenty-five thousand dollar carpet like Frank got
Blot that shit, I'll pop that shit
That got niggas talkin' about callin' the cops and shit
You pussy, I'm the opposite, hardcore
Kevlar vest on my flesh in a large form, P

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Every day I dream I see you dreamin'
I cock my strap, I see you schemin'
I want you to try me, nigga, I'm fiendin'
To pop my shit then forever you sleepin'
When robberies done improperly
It turns into murder one, one, one
Move properly or get dropped, see
Come at me wrong and you're done, done, done

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Test me, you wan' die? Murder a lung now
Fresh of the projects, put ten on my neck
It's off limits, touch it, touch the sky
Touch it, I'll send you to ya dead homies to say hi
I break niggas into fractions, I'm down for that action
Talk that chopper talk 'til I come with the Colt
Then it's bye-bye, close your eyes, learn to fly
Why go through it, why try and test I?
When you know I ain't rap right, I'm strapped right
2-4-7, 3-6-5, I'm outside, steady mobbin'
I'm all in, I'm not the one you robbin'
Have me creepin', crawlin', shell cases fallin'
Bullet hit your leg, break your limb
Bullets hit your chest, make you slim
Bullets flyin', run away from them
Bullets miss you, hit your closest friend
You pussy, mane, you should've gave your toast to him

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Every day I dream I see you dreamin'
I cock my strap, I see you schemin'
I want you to try me, nigga, I'm fiendin'
To pop my shit then forever you sleepin'
When robberies done improperly
It turns into murder one, one, one
Move properly or get dropped, see
Come at me wrong and you're done, done, done

[Outro: Sean Price]
Ayo, Fif, I know what these niggas is, man. These niggas ain't tough, my G. Niggas talk 'bout they been in the streets. Yeah, you was in the streets, motherfuckers. You 'se a fuckin' human holst, nigga. You held the whole crew guns, nigga. Fuck outta here, man. You that nigga when I brought that vest I took you on the roof. Put it on your back, see if that shit work, motherfucker. You in the street, nigga. What the fuck was you doin' though? P!
