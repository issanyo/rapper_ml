[Verse One: Sean Price]
Yo
I see you in Hell with a bucket of ice
You bitch ass niggas can't fuck with my price (P!)
Two for five
Four for ten
Eight for twenty
Bottom line take the money
Yo, I have a, need to rob but I need a job
Every time I get a job then the job get robbed
I'm the first one fired, the last one hired
A disgruntled rapper who flatten your four tires
In P-Ville
We get your ole' girl naked off of E pill and a Sheryl Crowe record
Y'all can't fuck with me, y'all could then you would
You can't so you don't, my hands on your throat
The hash in the trees, enhancing the smoke
The lactose of shit, advancing the dope

[Verse Two: Mr. Eon]
Mr. Eon without an eighth to twist
Is sorta like Jim Steak without The Wiz
It's just not the same, shook cops to aim
Keep telling these fools, looks all a game
But E's hall of fame
Be telling 'em that, same place Arbie's selling 'em at
Only heads at my show, nerds are foul
The only way I'm hear about is through word of mouth

[Sean Price]
Yo, never test me when I'm crazy high
[?] and let your 80 fly
The slug missed you, oh shit your lady died
In the side of a ride like she Lady Di
Yo, ain't no telling what the Ruck will say, Ruck will do
Rough with her, rough with who?
Listen that's the reason why I don't fuck with you
You run your mouth like a bitches and the sluts will do
