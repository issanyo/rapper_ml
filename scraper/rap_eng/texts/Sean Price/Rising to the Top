[Sean Price]
Yeah, we all cool, pa, anybody can get it
Winchester Remington's, any shotty I'll hit it
Yo, dress sloppy, but my rap is dapper
Watch Rosewood go outside and slap a cracker
Yo, various styles and, various hot shit
Killed a nigga on a train with Barry Slotnick, dude
Bottom line, you ain't ready for Ruck
Where your girl, duke, I'm ready to fuck
Do the knowledge, I'm ill
Especially when the god swallowing pills
Spaz out on your bitch while she gobble my dill
All my niggas went through drama, for real
Ruck dred, Agallah, body armor steel, squar from the ville
Untouchable, Sean Conner's got kill
Ya'll niggas chill before ya moma get killed, yo
Untouchable, Sean Conner's got kill
Ya'll niggas chill before ya moma get killed, yo

[Hook 2x: Agallah]
And we gon' give this all that we got
Blow the spot, keep rising to the top
All my niggas, keep rising to the top

[Agallah]
Everyone welcome to the gangsta world of Agallah
Where it's me and my niggas, my bitches, my guns and my cars
My dogs don't care, they'll kill these rap stars
I like ridin' around with a gangsta broad
I'mma gangsta dog, go with the shotty, or I'm shankin' y'all
Wind up in prison, no thanks to y'all
Come back to the block, then I break y'all balls
Get murked right on the spot, so we don't have to brawl
Listen up, pa, don't fuck with Agallah
None of these niggas could never see the catalog
I don't give a fuck if it's digital or analog
I flip, to any style, pa, press record
Give me a million, that's how you blessed the lord
Bullshit me? I won't even step to y'all
Consider the shit, this is what I left with y'all
Look at all the hot shit, that I kept from y'all

[Hook 2x]

[Hook: Agallah, Sean Price]
It's music in the air, a lots of loving everywhere
Everybody, gettin' right, everybody, gettin' right
It's smoke all in the air, everybody wanna share
Niggas is gettin' high, niggas is gettin' high

[Sean Price]
I love spittin raps and flows, I love gettin' stacks of dough
Like I love hittin' rats and hoes
I've been to club, where the stash is yo
Why you bumpin' me, god, actin' up in front of company, god
Got some shit up in the trunk of my car
We can fight right now, you get lumped in the bar
Bottom line duke; fuck who you are
Spit two gem stars out my mouth, give you a couple of scars

[Agallah]
The flame from Ruck and Agallah, and lendin' y'all spitly
We come through like this from Brooklyn, my niggas hopin' shitly
While niggas like Blick Street that be reppin' with me
My nigga Ike Eyes, yo I call him Ike Hitly
It's Agal-litly, featuring Sean Printly
We don't waste no time, we take care of this quickly
For real my nitly, it's about to get off the hitly
For shitly, you know where I'm at, my nigga, hit me
And God be with me, through the streets I move switfly
You want war, with a nigga, pa, then come and get me

[Hook 2x]
