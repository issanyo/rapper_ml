[Verse One] [Shabaam Sahdeeq]:
It's our time
Chalk it up to experience
I'll rope you up
After the track dope you up
Have you fiendin' like a methadone clinic until I finish
Tracks I gracefully spit on, MC's I shit on
Your name will mean nothin' after I start crushin' over percussion
Drinkin' vodka like a wild Russian
My name holds weight like a freight train
But I'm slept on like a bum in the last car, awake y'all
Where the screetches stop, the speakers stop cause y'all
The enemy on the low, but I just ain't know
But right here we got the got the best spitters
Voice paint pictures like Michelangelo
On the ceiling of a cathedral
I'll feed you with nothing but intelligent thug ism
Knowledge and wisdom, my words shine colors in the prism
I'm livin' spendin' they buckets, started fuckin' I'm gone
Knockin' my own songs, fondling on some thongs
Of a long legged Amazon
Shotgun with her skirt on
Suckin' an Icee
Thinkin' she gon' be wifey
I'm nice see
Oh you only see MTV?
Lot of empty MC's, none of them see me

[Verse Two] [UG]:
Yo Barry Bonds rap, you know how I do with mines
The game tried to ban me, say I'm juicing my lines
And usin' nine
Make niggas lose they mind with it
As soon as I click it and cock it I send a rocket
I lift it, I pop it, I'm sick with the topic, this kid a prophet
I spit it the hardest, my bitch is a goddess
My shit is the hardest
I'm a problem
Who want it in here?
I flip like David Banner changin' a spare
I aim it right there
And blow your face into space for real
Undertaker, the space in the ground to fill
I pound your grill
Into mince meat I'm simply
The best mahfucka, hear the tec mahfucka
Blaaaaa

[Verse Three] [Casual]:
Let's bet royalty checks, I'm comin' to collect mahfucka
Right in front of Jacobs to fit it, if it's a skank I'mma get it
They hatin'
I said, "Baby wait for a minute."
I stay fly
Your boy aviation lieutenant
And they be patient
Knowin' that it's hard to shook me
Silence struck, when they seen Sarge salute me
Beats will ? , bacon soda rhymer
When I tell them that I'm takin' over, they thank a soldier
Ankle holster, Velcro strap where my Achilles is
We're willy's but really it's who spit the silliest
I'm in my poetical prime, puffin' plenty purple
Kill half ya cypher
Leave you with a semi-circle
You rap war, but can you shoot?
You get starved out, I carved out of bamboo shoot
And spit a flow blow dark at your so so art
Your boy coco, you niggas never show no hearts
Steppin' to Jojo
I rap with the rap mortician is awful
One rap blew out his latissimus dorsi
So keep it poppin' while y'all niggas big gun coppin'
But niggas run like they brought stockings
I Bernard Hopkins
The jaw droppin' with no options

[Verse Four] [Sean Price]:
Ayo 'Pac got shot (damn)
Biggie got shot (pssst)
Gravy got shot (who?)
Nobody cares
Sean Price, duke I'm takin' it there
Matter fact, tie one hand around my back, bitch I'm makin' it fair
Brownsvillein'
Run up on a clown, the pound kill him
Antibiotic rap, the track is penicillin
Party people
P is a poet, the poem please you
Power to the people, the pistol pop paralegals
Listen
My aim's the truth, I aim and shoot
You found dumped in the trunk bitch, Rae Carruth
Sean Price I don't play in the booth, I go in so
Never bet again me my nigga, there's no wins
Yes yes y'all and ya don't stop
S Double, Sean P will get ya shot
Yes yes y'all and ya don't quit
U.G./Casual is the ultimate bitch
