[Intro: Sean Price]
Yo Ruck what up with you and Rock man?
What up with the crew? What up the the Click man?
Yo shut the fuck up duke!
I don't wanna hear none of that ya mean?
We doing us, what the fuck you doing?
Spectating, hating, sideline ass niggas
Ya bitch nigga
Listen, A-yo

[Verse One: Sean Price]
Y'all niggas think Sean P won't set it for real
'Til I leave a 38 slug embedded in grills
Y'all niggas think Sean P won't set it for real
'Til I leave a 38 slug embedded in grills
The best in the 'ville, rather get the cheddar and chill
Instead I look forward to leaving your ass beheaded and killed
Duke I'm Mike Tyson crazy, give me medicine pills
And my niggas all ride wearing red in the 'ville
And y'all niggas all hide when I'm red in the 'ville
And y'all niggas small fries getting head with you're krills
Blowing your dough, overall blowing your blow
Gave blow to a ho so the ho can blow
Tricking on head, never pay a bitch for no head
I just spit pimp shit, play tricks with her head
Y'all niggas is young boys who still piss in the bed
My niggas is big boys who throw the fifth to your head
I run with fat niggas, who eat ribs and swine
Who ain't got time for this shit
