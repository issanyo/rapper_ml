[Intro] (two goons arguing)
Man the bag, with the shit got shit on the bag
(Alejandro!)
You heard me nigga the bag with the shit got shit on the bag
How the fuck did the bag with the shit get shit on it?
I don't know man but the bag with the shit got shit on the bag man I'm not picking up that shit
There's a lot of shit in that bag man for you not to pick up man pick that shit up
I'm not picking that shit up man. That shit got shit on the bag

[Verse 1]
(It go)
Better my bars, my bars better than every of y'all
Can never fuck with the god whenever cheddar involved
Knock the wind outta nigga like a medicine ball
Ready with sket whenever the veteran call
If rhyming is fighting then I be Tyson
If fighting was rhyming then your ass can't fight friend
Cyber dub they be typing the beats freely
C.P. in the streets talking 'bout peace treaty
Half naked eating sand in Reese Beach
Ball between your legs niggas call you Maurice Cheeks
I like bein' alone home I trim the fat
Friends hating on ends but none of them can rap
I will take your FUBU and take my time
Duke I'm waste removal, you a waste of time
(P!) I will pop your partner
Then give my whole squad bricks Waka Flocka (ahhhh)

[Hook: Loudmouf Choir]
The bag with the shit got shit on the bag [singing] x4

[Verse 2]
Back to the basic straight racist
Smack black off face bitch
Listen, soon as your fam enter, he get shot
White sheet, duke, like clan member
Sean's shit is the best bitch
Ask 5-0 the content is aggressive
The AR clapper[?? clapped ya ??] in your dome
Hoes call it hairline fracture
Listen
So tough sho'nough [sure enough] the master
Stuff a motherless child wild fuck the bastard
Shorty Shitstain naughty with the fifth bang
Sorta Rick James caught him [??when he sniffed 'caine??]
I will clap your Kangol fake ass nigga Saxon Anglo
(P!) I was rap before
I'm hard headed nigga
So I'm back for more
(Alejandro!)
