[Verse 1-Illa Ghee]
I'm the king, no burger
Cook words, serve 'em
Bitch , give me head and we ain’t going any further
Push me to the limit like the Montana movie
It’s all about money, so I bypass the [?]
Please tell my people when to sell what they [?]
Illa rap, I'mma make your whole face droopy
Pale henny, I spilled liquor on my tan Timb's
And I ball like a [?] to the [?] age
Tell them I can start and I can make wars
Cameras on record but I know you can't afford
Overlord, I promise that you’ll never beat me
[?] social graffiti
I’m just as good as the weed I breathe
Move a weave when I release my seed
Drivin’ through the city with a 5 speed
Nigga toast no rapper that is unseen

[Hook](x2)
Let me speak to them
I’mma keep shooting
Yeah I'm from the ruins
You got to keep it moving
And never stop doing
You got to keep it grooving
The iller flow fluent
[?]

[Verse 2-Sean Price]
Eight Africa duct tape your face way trafficker [?]
Cut your light short, pull up that long weed
First class, you act like I sat in the wrong seat
Fucking Jim Crow law, I pluck you the fuck out Kimbo law
Nigga, who’s the master?
Have you jump out the car park, Dukes of Hazzard
It can’t be used, till you use this trash shit
Wasting time, nah, shoot the bastard
Shake your neck, peep me the slasher
No, take on my neck, but peep me the master
[?] my dilla my skrilla
Joe [?] you're fun, King Kong your song
Attempt murder, you got the wrong shooter
They call me [?] Junior

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 3-Illa Ghee]
[?] like from bottom is
Optimus Primetime, I'm holding eight nines like an octopus
Shake the bassline, every verse is on like eight times
[?] is a hate crime, crossing on state lines
Crush [?], crush [?], I can crush the villain
I got bars like a prison, its locked down
Pull deep, ayo I'm rather unique
I can put the Grim Reaper to sleep
As far as death, I'm a clean-sweep
I can have your life contract bleached
My car seats is the color of bleach
[?] with me
It's all style, chum
Heaven style [?] slumped over like a [?]
But y'all listening to an original G
I rap physical Columbia key, criminal spree
Use some scissors to cut your losses
Rapping killer, looking iller than [?]

[Hook](x2)
