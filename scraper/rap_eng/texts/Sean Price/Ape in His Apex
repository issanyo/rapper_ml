[Verse 1: Sean Price]
P!
All my niggas got a F on they jacket
Pistol pop pellets pierce through you and who's on your fabrics
Goose feathers went everywhere, some of them shits bloody
New leather, the sweater you never can wear, judge me
Profiling, posted on the ave P in Polo
So silent, smoking on a bag of diesel dolo
Effervescent, refreshing, the best at
Sean shit good hood? Maybe the best act
Nevermind that, shit don't matter
Bet I rhyme clever lines, shit don't matter
Every line except for mine, shit [?] rappers
Forever I'm millimeter nine gorilla ether divine
Shit to share, shoot the fair, shot a gun
Shoot the shit 'til your shit shot, shoulda shot a fair one (Damn)
The nicest
Sean price is
An ape in his apex

[Chorus: Ruste Juxx]
Ape food
Bamboo shoots and fresh fruits
Termite larvae
Listen what the god say
Sing a sad song like Sade
(I'ma eat your food like this fucker an entree, P!)

[Verse 2: Ruste Juxx]
Ruste Juxx is an ape in his apex
Raw like my dick busting out of the latex
Spray tec's out the grey Lex
Wet up your Avirex
You exchange gay sex for paychecks
Sean Price shoot your guts in the gravel
Slugs got passports, bullets will travel
International live from Kingston Avenue
Stash roaches, rolled the blunt from the revenue
Sword stabbing you
Samurai, sensei
My hearts muy frio, the flow's caliente
Your shit wackator
I might crack your jaw
Used to sell coke, pure white, called it Macklemore
Holes I rip in 'em
Deadly when I spit venom
Stomped the mud hole one pair of kicks in 'em
For hard bars this verse will get the most write ups
Son I'm nice, Sean Price is the ghostwriter

[Chorus: Ruste Juxx]
Ape food
Bamboo shoots and fresh fruits
Termite larvae
Listen what the god say
Sing a sad song like Sade
(I'ma eat your food like this fucker an entree, P!)
