[Intro: Sean Price]
Yeah; Sean P, nah mean?
Megatron, Jedi Mind Tricks, M.F.C
Yo, Boot Camp, listen. Yo

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Yeah first of all don't make me burst and brawl
Image is nothing you fronting see the thirst in y'all
Think it's fucked up now, it get worst for y'all
Assassinate your best friend now I hurt you par
Run up on your block with dough and I curse you all
The fuck out, want to wet duke? Squirt your four
Since birth I been raw hot like surface core
Kidnap your baby's mom straight earth the whore
See I do rhyme and crime so I can purchase more
If you ain't in it for that what the purpose for
Act like you don't give a fuck though
Good so I buck fo' shots from the roof
And my man Rock catch you up close
Never give a fuck about niggas y’all not Nutso
Hype off of carbonated water and some fructose
Straight buck foes when the nigga Ruck pull the snub nose
Wait Ruck chill, what the deal it's all love though
Look into my eyes and you can tell there's something changed
Running gunning things knocking niggas out like Clubber Lang
The gun I bring is straight for fucking beating you down
Heating you down leaving you six feet deep in the ground

[Hook: Vinnie Paz]
It's some real motherfuckers going rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash getting got tonight
Or somebody in the club getting shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
I'm the motherfucking ungrateful
My heart is hateful, my tongue ripped
Licking on the blade that slayed you
You faggots act as bitch as RuPaul
You niggas share one milkshake with two straws
You're trapped with no doors, four walls tighten
Seeing the roof fall, feeling the floors heighten
Crushed and shit, your bones are blood siphoned
And put into a jug we sip before fighting
I'm raw lightning; my power extends
In the planet and out through the opposite ends
Black man travel through the universe and back
While cavemen still though that the earth was flat
But we kept the sacred plans, now we carry
Throughout the ancient lands
Before the separating of the sands
When God saw the power I create in my hand
He banned my gene strain from replicating in man

[Hook: Vinnie Paz] (x2)
It's some real motherfuckers going rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash getting got tonight
Or somebody in the club getting shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
I'm tasteless; there's beauty in strange places
I find beauty in razors
I find beauty in blood dripping from ya faces
I find beauty in the Qur'an and all of its Aramaic equations
I find beauty in twelve gauges
I find beauty in teaching you what the definition of pain is
I find beauty in stainless steel
That can kill and reveal the front of your grill
You're brainless, y’all don't wanna test Vinnie Paz patience
I crack jaws and swing swords of the ancients
Y’all pretended to overstand the matrix
Without attempting to overstand its basics
We dedicated to cats that's been thugging
Vinnie Paz got more hoes then Jim Duggan
Y’all been ducking for quite some time now
Vinnie 'bout to teach you how to write some rhymes now
We aim beams in between your eyebrows
Jedi Mind, Sean P combine now

[Hook]
It's some real motherfuckers goin rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash gettin got tonight
Or somebody in the club gettin shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight
