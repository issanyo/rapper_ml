[Intro]
Who we be?
We be the B double O - T - C - A -M - P
Who we be?
We be the B double O - T - C - A -M - P
Who we be?
We be the B double O - T - C - A -M - P
Who we be?
We be the B double O - T - C - A -M - P

[Verse 1: Rock]
I'm caught up in a zone of my own, I roam
Run my fingers through my hair and give air to my stoned dome
And analyze, who to tear through, I dare you
Devils that try to ban me that dare would be bare proof
Who's he? stalking the streets when there's no life
Eyes glow like tyco night glows, we's in flight
But it don't glow like, wack, the glow's phat
And it be the only glow that lemme know where a true warrior be at

[Verse 2: Louieville Sluggah and (Rock)]
OGC, Gunn Clappa, number 2
(Louieville, do he ill, snap in half your crew
Back, smack, a few of you till your ears ring)
Duke I smack 'em with the bat (Why?)
So my hands don't sting
I bring rec in this game, and don't shit change
I inflicts pain like a stressed brain having a migraine
Heads talk trash, walk in paths like anorexic
Patients, laced up, overdosed in the exits
And see, hears, these dumb, blind rappers
Who don't know the meaning of the Originoo Gunn Clappaz
Many phrases, many ways you can explain this
Put on some rough, tough shit, huh, I'll make you famous
So, step don't stare, dare cross this path beware
Representativz and foul play got the rear
(Got the rear)

[Chorus: Rock]
We see in the dark like an owl
Daytime's used to plot schemes for the night prowl
Out to eliminate those who live foul
Daytime's used to plot schemes for the night prowl

[Verse 3: Ruck]
Creep stalking, weed, coughing
Burgling, make me wonder why I'm not sleep walking
Peeps talking, I hear 'em as I walk by, but they all die
I'm fortified with the 45
Fuck it! Let me proceed with the mission
No need for intermission, I need trees in my system
Cut down Dumont, then I head through Bristol park
With my P.N.C., for some yard to spark
No need to get hyper, I see, C, Cypher
Power on the corner fucking with my niggas, every hour
I devour, niggas who wanna test me and defy me
It might be Giuliani or the illuminati
But I be, writing plans of attack in my journal
So, Ruck, Rock, Ville Sluggah remains nocturnal
Seeing through sheisty shit, shining like I'm solar
Penetrate through darkness bounce like I'm sonar

[Chorus: Rock]
We been found less an organised ways to buckwild
Daytime's used to plot schemes for the night prowl
Spread the word, 29 million square miles
Daytime's used to plot schemes for the night prowl

[Verse 4: Rock]
One clik, stomping on the path, that's so hard
Ain't no smiling, we up against the odds like Phil Collins
Meanwhile, I still be wilding, but only smarter (what?)
Peep me the irrational and the quiet riot starter
Pardon this, I see you're not the sharpest pencil in the box
No where near a match, you get smashed by a Rock
I done seen 3 dollar bills and you faker
And you wonder why I hate ya
A snake'll get snatched by his tail, slammed on his head
Give me some panda thread (??) the cobra command the dead
Ban the red
W - hypen B - U Recognise! Heltah Skeltah digs them and not you

[Chorus: Rock]
Damn, ?? trials
Daytime's used to plot schemes for the night prowl
We live nocturnal in the ninety-now
Daytime's used to plot schemes for the night prowl
In the concretes streets of Bucktown
Daytime's used to plot schemes for the night prowl
Don't let your name show up next on my file
Daytime's used to plot schemes for the night prowl
