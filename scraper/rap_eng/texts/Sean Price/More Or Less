[Verse One]:
I flow great (flow great)
I hold weight (hold weight)
Spit hot shit need Colgate
Yo, teeth kinda yellow, don't floss between meals
Cop a watch and whip and floss between deals
Sean P!
I'm 6'1" you all notice him
Shot my first nigga two blocks from Paul Robeson
All over son, you know my team, we all tote a gun
If a nigga sound like me on the mic, cause I wrote it son
Don't ask me shit about Pa I don't roll with him
Just admit, Ruck too much, ain't no controllin' him
God cypher divine, rhyme shine like linoleum
I'm knowin' them niggas can't catch them lines I'm throwin' 'em
Yo, I'm updated duke, state of the art
Motherfuckers frustrated that I'm takin' ya heart
Dare you to start
Jump up, I'll tear you apart
Fuck shittin' bricks my nigga, I dare you to fart

[Hook]:
Yo, more or less duke, my life is a mess
So I puff on the stress till I cardiac arrest
Yo, more or less duke, fuck the world
My moms died, cousin sick, somebody fucked my girl
Yo, more or less duke ya niggas ain't that strong
My gat bong niggas, fuck a verse on a rap song
More or less duke, yo Ruck is the best
When you fuck with the best, yo, you fuckin' with death

[Verse Two]:
Yo, I'm Sean Price (who?)
No relation to Kelly
Used to be wack with raps came back like Makavelli
I smack shit outta ya, on the low I doubted ya
Fuck with the nigga Ruckus when I'm holdin' my caliber
How about if I, smash ya shit like Gallagher
Step to the plate, great, I scrape all my challengers
Fuckin' lame
I shake yo' ass like the Ruckin' game
Bust a flame, touch your brain
For a buck and change
Ya gotta be
Outta ya mind, ain't no stoppin' me
I cocked the G, locked it, big Rockin' ya knot somethin' properly
Cause atrocities to your properties when I cock and squeeze
Mom and pops in beef screamin' to cops "He got rotten teeth."
6'1", nappy hair, pack a lot of heat
Gotta creep through your projects but yo I'm not a sneak
What?
Ya niggas is butt, I smell doo doo
Who do you think you are?
Get me vexed, hexed like voodoo
Ayo, I set it off for blacks, white, Puerto Ricans and Haitians
Jews, Japaneses and Tiger Woods Cablinasians
Crazy ass Jamaicans, K.C.H.I. patients
See me in fatigues and they start about facin'

[Hook]

[Verse Three]:
Ayo the battery pack rap
Action figure nigga with Kung Fu
Rick get your shit split quick when I come through
Yo, I do the kinda shit that a thug do
Lust funds, bust guns, plus I do drugs too
Nigga can't do the shit that me and my son do
Mastered the Art Of War before a nigga met Sun Tzu
Bustin' the chrons
You can call me Ruckus but Sean
Is the name that I choose to be called when I'm in front of my moms
Maculate mack daddy drivin' the fat black Caddy
Act like you know, I know why you actin', get clapped badly
I'll pop three up at your knot fleet, jump in the hot V
Cops try to knock me but watch me get away scott free
Ain't the fact that you nice pa, just that you not me
Jump out the jalopy and let my nigga big Rock squeeze
Cop pleas runnin' down the block where the cop be
Shots leave nigga laid out, lookin' knock kneed

[Hook]
