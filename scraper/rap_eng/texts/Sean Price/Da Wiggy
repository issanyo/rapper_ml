[Ruck]
A nigga run shit like trackmeets, when blacks meet
In the back streets, my gat greets
Niggas that don't recognize my rap sheet
The facts be, the Ruck rains like the weather
Cuz Rock makes cops throw Glocks down like Heather
B.,
Niggas better be ahead of me
Trynna flow steadily, ain't even on my pedigree
That's my word, bitch-ass niggas is herbs
Cuz half of the time, half of they rhymes are absurd
I serve, justice, must this, be the answer
For my gun to click, terminal like cancer
And the answer, Ruck and Rock for a thou'
Now how the fuck did you come up with that style?
Sing songs with six-packs, that's when I smoke seven
Sacks of cess, make Ruck bust caps at the reverend
So chill chicken, 'fore I choose to chastise, bruise
Batter and baptize, bitches and bums
With blood from black eyes, when I slap guys

[Rock]
Send that guy to Rockness Monsta
Stomp ya, split him in half, divide and conquer
I want ya

[Ruck]
To test the irrational inflictor
Rock pounds the ground, while Ruck shakes the Richter

[Rock]
Commence the Rock slide, I'm crushin' ya pride by surprise
It be the Bummy Jab, Center for the Fab 5
It's remarkable, like the Little Rascals
If I'm being polite, I'm schemin' like Eddie Haskell
Don't let me gat you, in half to, bring the wrath, too
Don't ask fool, sure, I'll sell you a new ass crack blew
And if you think a nigga's cocky, I dare any ten of you
To come and try and stop me, Rock be
A champion soldier, "Folger", like coffee
Tell em wipe ya mouth was in yo bitch, back up off me
Move on please, cause, Sparsky and Dutch might provoke
The cops or, choke ya pops, if we smoke alot

[Hook 2X: Heltah Skeltah]
We don't give a what? Da wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, what?
Da wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy --- what?

[Ruck]
When I flow like the Nile river, that's when I deliver
Nuff slugs to ya chest, makin' ya whole body shiver
Niggas wonder why the irrational God Ruck be flippin''
Like I was Mary Lou Retton, with nines that be wettin'
Yo section, when niggas step in my arena, bound to see ya
Nigga like Ruck, Buckshot's, and catch misdemeanor's
I'm similar to none son, that be my stee
So flee from ya fuckin' face, double jeopardy

[Rock]
All praise me, Rock, I rule in hip hop
Fools'll get dropped, if 'em got the balls
To stand when I'm lickin' shots, if not, I got the bright red dots
Station, on top of the four-four, to blow ya fuckin' face in, Jason
Ain't half as scary as the derriere
Kicker, mister flipster, "there he is" too late I hit ya
If you don't think I make ya block ache
The, next time I come through it'll be your jaw that I break a
Snake a, get skinned in the wind
Shame my Boot Camp name, and Rock must defend
Burn your bitch ass with ten nails, in my military jail
Make all that diesel shit you poppin' turn frail
Well, like iron, I pumps lead into yo body, punk
Or a pump pellet if I got my pump shotty
Why these cats always askin', for shit them not want
Get yo shit, bumped and crippled for months, and don't front
Fuckin' punk ---
