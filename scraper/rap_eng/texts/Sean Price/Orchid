[Verse 1: J.T. Cavey]
As our world oscillates to shake the weak remains, show your strength
Resist all temptation to follow illusions, expressed with safety
Open up your wings and fly to sanctuary
Trying to dislocate from talk and scoff that shows them what they are
Murderous words might as well been sent by a bullet
Keep your eyes closed and your fingers crossed
Till our paths meet, I'll try to lead the way
Take me back to who I was back then
I'll show you what life means to me again
Maybe in due time, you'll let me in
I'll lift the weight so you don't have to fall

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Brother, when every muscle strains
I will lift the weight for you
Sister, if you just call my name
I will lift the weight for you
You can't find the strength, your eyes lose resistance
I will lift the weight for you

[Verse 2: J.T. Cavey]
I wasn't there for the darkest of hallways, the longest of paths
A crazy train going off the tracks
Catch my fall when the earth shakes
Catch my fall when the earth shakes

[Bridge: Jesse Cash & J.T. Cavey]
Take me back to who I was back then
An honest man and a faithful friend
I'll show you what life means to me again
Maybe in due time, you'll let me in
Take me back to who I was back then
An honest man and a faithful friend
I'll show you what life means to me again
Maybe in due time, you'll let me in
'Cause there is so much left to amend

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Brother, when every muscle strains
I will lift the weight for you
Sister, if you just call my name
I will lift the weight for you
You can't find the strength, your eyes lose resistance
I will lift the weight for you
I know that we've changed, but this remains consistent
I will lift the weight for you

[Outro: J.T. Cavey]
We pick at the scab, it bleeds and it bleeds
Extending the healing to keep us contained
A weak doppelganger, the bastard one
I'll leave you behind and continue on
