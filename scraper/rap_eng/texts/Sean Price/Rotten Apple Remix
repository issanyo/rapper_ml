[Hook]
The Rotten Apple made me like this
I don't give a fuck
I shoot a nigga down and cut a nigga up
New York made me this way; I'm all about a buck
My close friends was murdered, I bullet proof my truck
Shit, New York taught me, it's no mercy
It's no lettin' it slide, I'm so thirsty
New York!, New York!, nigga! (New York City)
It's Queens New York nigga!

[Verse One: Prodigy]
Listen nigga, my face got the scars
My brain got the smarts, my chest got the heart
To fuck someone up, what nigga? I make it hot
Police be up on the block, cause P just shot
Some stupid fucka, now you niggas can't pump, ol' mad at me
Should be mad at that nigga whose tryna crab me
You know I ain't the one if you didn't you know now
These niggas be slow, 'til I blow the four pound
And put a 'lil pep in their step
I got death for any nigga wit an 'S' on their chest
That's my reflexes, when you hear them shots
See if I gave it to a nigga he deserves what he got
Look my hammer got the cure for your amnesia
How conveniently we forget, P is Black Caesar
And Hell over in Queens that swell up in my jeans
Don't mean I'm happy to see you, that mean I got the thang

[Verse Two: Sean Price]
Look here nigga
I fuck niggas up, every damn day
Welcome to Bucktown U.S.A
Smack earth, wind, fire and ice out your face
Take crack out your pocket and scream "got Rob Based"
Knife game, gun game, nice with my hands
Fuck around and leave you right where you stand
Listen, punch a fan in the face and I lose a sale
Nah, I punch a fan and get sued then jailed
Comstockin' twenty cents to ten arms lockin'
Pray five times a day, Allah doctrine
You got a hot song but your album is not popping
Fuck it, do your thing homes, money off of ringtones
Best emcee that you know with no chain
Rather spit lines then sniff lines of cocaine
I did a whole eighth in a sniff
You call it a problem I call it a gift
P!
