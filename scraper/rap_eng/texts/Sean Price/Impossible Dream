[Intro: Sample + Ras Kass]
"Close your eyes"
(Sh, sh, ah, ah)
"Close..."
"Close..."
"Close..."
(Yeah, sleep is the cousin of death)
"Close..."
(Yo)

[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
Close your eyes, dream—2Pac come and ride with me
Or travel to your punishment and come and cry with me
All seeing eye gypsy, I tipsy, lost angel
While I'm sipping my whisky and plotting my murders
A Neo-Nat Turner, I'm MC in that water
Of illuminating the righteous, I spoke on Illuminati
You was shitting on your diapers, you scared of life, I'm voodooing the vipers
Pan's Labyrinth, start Googling the ciphers
Shit
All I need is a gun and real ass homies
Promise to my enemies, I'm cutting to the bone meat
Cartilage, Spartacus, John is just autonomous
The Wolverine type to like pull out his old heart and just
Call this E.D. Eminem, no lights and beams
No radio rap bitch niggas with they tight ass jeans
This Elohim, smart niggas off a Kush and lean
Lights and beams that's gun play, fly like runway

[Hook: Ras Kass + Sample]
("Close...")
Dream the impossible dream
I'm Freddy Krueger with a blunt and some lean
("Close...")
Meditation with a Buddhist's breath
And sleep is the cousin of death
("Close...")
Dream the impossible dream
I'm Freddy Krueger with a blunt and some lean
("Close...")
Meditation with a Buddhist's breath
'Cause sleep is the cousin of death

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Ayo, stupid nigga Sean, super nigga, uh
Family reunion, communion—I'm shootin' at your moms
Tuh, I ain't right in the head
Gun in my hand—I guess I aim right for your head
Nigga, murder, death, kill, sex, money, mayhem
Morning murder with a weapon, steppin' to the A.M
Believe in my pa, same way you believe in your god
Whether it's Allah, Jesus, or Master Fard
Mastered the bars, blasted ratchets splatter your car
Vehicular homicide, the fuck the matter witchy'all?
P
Tuh, I will pop your nunu
If I don't do it then Rock'll shoot you
(Pop!) (Hehehehehe)
One smack and you look bad
Backpack rapper strapped with crack in my book bag
I'm a nigga (Nigga!) and that's what niggas do now
Wouldn't you like to be a nigga just like who?
P

[Hook]
("Close...")
Dream the impossible dream
I'm Freddy Krueger with a blunt and some lean
("Close...")
Meditation with a Buddhist's breath
And sleep is the cousin of death
("Close...")
Dream the impossible dream
I'm Freddy Krueger with a blunt and some lean
("Close...")
Meditation with a Buddhist's breath
(Yo, shit)
'Cause sleep is the cousin of death

[Verse 3: Ras Kass]
I was made to spit 'cause I sing like Ice JJ Fish
Get rich, bad kid on my Bay Bay shit
Extortin' wack rappers like, "Pay day, bitch"
You watch Kardashian's sex tape, stare at Ray J's dick
(Ew!)
Shit, and I ain't gotta say more
The mind that's attached to this spine is a Claymore
Waterproof submariner, bitch, I'm Prince Namor
Marvel at the heart, I turn dolphins into sharks
When God made me, He broke the mold
Nosferatu, Noah put my coffin in the ark
Put the spark into arc, architect, masonic
I'm so dark into my arts like the dart, but with the heart
Who the fuck does this? No new nigga
I be new schoolin' old-school-continuation-tutor niggas
Old schoolin' new town niggas, school-shootin' niggas
Invade your hood like Vladimir Putin, nigga

[Hook]
