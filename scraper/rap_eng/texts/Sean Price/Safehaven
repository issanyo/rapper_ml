[Intro: Jesse Cash]
Every memory recalled is an origin that we've altered
Broken promises to another man's daughter
Endless walk down a dead road as our last breaths begin to falter
We lend our weight to the backs of our broken fathers

[Verse 1: J.T. Cavey]
Featherweight boy in his arms, every night he weeps
Constantly drifting in and out of sleep
Palm against transparent skin, fingers tracing ribs
Reassurance that the heart was still beating
At the helm of death every day like clockwork
Restless nights with trembling hands against transparent skin
But they carry on because survival is not a dead end

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Whether or not the world is withered away
We are each other's world entirely
Whether or not the world is withered away
We are ever, we are evermore

[Verse 2: J.T. Cavey]
Lost ghosts around every corner, on every charred sidewalk
Still trudging through the ash of an endless walk
With bodies cold and weightless, resilient of death in life
Resilient of death in death, they walk on

[Bridge: Jesse Cash & J.T. Cavey]
Dreaming of a safe haven at the end of the road
An unstable safety, the only kind we've ever known
Oh, we walk along, dreaming of a safe haven
Oh, we walk along at the end of the road
Our legs will never fail, we'll carry on
And I swear to you

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Whether or not the world is withered away
We are each other's world entirely
Whether or not the world is withered away
We are ever, we are evermore

[Bridge: Jesse Cash & J.T. Cavey]
Oh, we walk along, dreaming of a safe haven
Oh, we walk along at the end of the road
Resilient of death because life is not a dead end

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Whether or not the world is withered away
We are each other's world entirely
Whether or not the world is withered away
We are ever, we are evermore

[Outro: J.T. Cavey & Jesse Cash]
Survival is not a dead end
We are evermore
Because survival is not a dead end
We are ever, we are evermore
