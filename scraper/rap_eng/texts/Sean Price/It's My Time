[Intro: Sean Price]
The BCC and double D in the 2k4 you pay more
Listen this is The BCC and double D in the 2k4 you pay more

[Hook]
Nigga it's my time
Biggie Smalls dead, 2Pac shot, so it's my time
This motherfuckering Jay Z quitting
And 50 Cent and Ja Rule constantly conflicting, so it's my time
Eminem nice but Eminem white, nigga it's my time

[Pre Verse One: Sean Price]
P!
Yeah the Boot Camp we back baby, Sean Price
I wanna welcome y'all to Donkey Sean Jr
Hosted by my man PF Cuttin'
And Sean Price, Word
Haha
Word, I'mma take it back for y'all
Yo

[Verse One: Sean Price]
I'm smoking on black, bitch swallow E
On a journey can see if you real, Sean P
The nine hits the body, body thinks the mind is berserk
The mind tell the body lay the fuck down in the dirt
I pop, you shot, you bitch niggas know about me, Ruck and Rock
Incredible Hulk drinking, Hennessy and Hpnotiq mixed with chronic, you could never take a pull
Whatever I see I will snatch
Fuck all the raps black, y'all niggas is wack
Yo, Sean Price burn a L in a cell
Look into the eyes of a rapper who fell
I hit your head on the concrete and squeeze the heat
Bong, another bitch nigga in the street
Bullseye my sket hit, oh shit
But how many motherfuckers must get dissed

[Hook]
It's my time
Biggie Smalls dead, 2Pac shot, so it's my time
Motherfuckering Jay Z quitting
And 50 Cent and Ja Rule constantly conflicting, so it's my time
Eminem nice but Eminem white, nigga it's my time

[Verse Two: Sean Price]
I can break it down like whatever you want
You want it like this, I hit you upside of your shit with my fist
Big Ruck, [?] by Rock you're not quick
Bitch, you still on my dick?
I roll 'em up, loot 'em up, shoot 'em up, whatever
I'm clever because I keep Beretta's under sweaters
I enter the show, make you scream ho
Bust a shot off in the crowd, just to let you know
I be the crazy maniac murder Mike Tyson type thinking
I'm bugging, I'm on drugs and you're in my lunch in
I spot 'em, then I got 'em, never should have popped 'em
But he was talking shit to the cops so I had to pop him
Yup, yup, you can get the fifth, whatever
But how many motherfuckers must get dissed

[Hook]
It's my time
Biggie Smalls dead, 2Pac shot, so it's my time
Motherfuckering Jay Z quitting
And 50 Cent and Ja Rule constantly conflicting, so it's my time
Eminem nice but Eminem white, nigga it's my time
