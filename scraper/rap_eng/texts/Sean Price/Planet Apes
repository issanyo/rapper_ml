[Sean Price]
GOON!
P!
Yo, Pantera and marijuan'
A bag of tan in the travel on
Backhandler, manhandle, Imam Sean
Peace to Mandela and Farrakhan
The best con in flesh, Sean's here
Metal fragments on face, the teflon beard
The ape is grape, the papes I make is great
The weight I break on plates is shake, don't hate
The flow is straight so no debate
I'm holdin' cake, unload the eight
Behold your face, bong!
Clapper of the nine, rap rapper all the time
Cat rewind that rapper rapid line's fine, I'm that
Son grimy on the motherfuckin' track
I once threw 190 on a motherfucker's back
Rap like somebody out already
Slapped him hardbody, damn he out already
Rebel handed tune, staring at the moon
The metal bearded goon, P!
