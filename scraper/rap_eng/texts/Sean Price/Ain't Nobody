[Verse One: Sean Price]
Where the fuck is you from?
Coming 'round acting like that, duke where the fuck is you from?
I'm not...
...Fucking with y'all
Y'all niggas is gay, fuck it, tuck in your balls
Listen, and I'm about to laugh
And I don't need to fucking giggle, I'm about to blast
I'm one of the best, Sean Price, Ruck in the flesh
Niggas scared of me, my rhymes and the gun I possess
Ain't no need for me to talk about the ones in my nest
'Cause if I did you motherfuckers probably come to my resc'
I'm off the chain, off the meter, a bitch
Offer me brain then I'm off to seek her, and if
Y'all niggas think I'm flapping my gums
Watch how fast you get clapped [?] with a gun
Y'all niggas is wack and act like thugs in the place
'Til I come through and back smack blood out your face
Yo!

[Scratching]
Ain't nobody
A-Ain't nobody
A-Ain't no-bo-bo-bo-bod
Nothing
Ain't nobody
A-Ain't nobody
A-Ain't no-bo-bo-bo-bod
Nothing

[Verse Two: Agallah]
Y'all know Agallah from U.S. to Argentina
I've been doing it with gats and carpet cleaners
Toss the nina, I don't want a carserena
I guess I gotta pay the price, what it costs to be a
Leader, you eat a dick, you be a bitch ass can see the
Grim Reaper, your life will be much deeper
Murder your fam 'cause I guess that's much cheaper
Get bodied by the same real nigga that will greet ya
Ain't nothing sweet with the street sweepers
We sweep sleepers
Keep peters and ninas under two seaters
What type of team do you think you can run with?
To me you was never that nigga to begin with
Feed you on a plater, don't matter, serve it and set it
Going out, what I'm about, [?] ya mouth how I end it
Scream gangster, I already did it
Still with it, Me and Sean P like Diddy gotta get it
Ya dig it, ya live it

[Scratching]
Ain't nobody
A-Ain't nobody
A-Ain't no-bo-bo-bo-bod
Nothing
Ain't nobody
A-Ain't nobody
A-Ain't no-bo-bo-bo-bod
Nothing

[Verse Three: Sean Price]
Some of my niggas bad speakin' the God
Damn! That's fucked up, it wasn't like that last week with the God
Y'all niggas straight ass cheeks at the God
When you see me don't say shit par, the gat speak for the God
If your shit fat then get on a track with the God
If your shit wack you can't get on a track with the God
Fuck I look like? Y'all bitch ass niggas is the shook type
Missy on the chorus, the song is wack but the hook tight

[Verse Four: Agallah]
Watch your ass, the nina might pop you fast
I got the drop lets see how long it last
Cops pick up the phone, you can call they ass
Before the blast, you only got seconds to gasp
In a couple of [?] your gonna be [?]
But none of them is no where near [?]
Yo I'm shitting large with killers and squads
Yeah I'm trying to do it, be that nigga in charge

[Scratching]
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
A-Ain't no-bo-bo-bo-bod
Nothing
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
A-Ain't no-bo-bo-bo-bod
Nothing
