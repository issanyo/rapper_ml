[ Illa Noyz ]
You didn't know so let it flow my slang bang ya
Crews move to my tunes before the Macarena
Consider it danger
Mongol slay it, play a beat like a perfect stranger
Simple and plain give me the lane-ahh
Catch the beat like grand groove
My hustle is mad smooth
Tight platoon since the rise of the black moon
Since you assume, youve seen my sun shining
And O.G.C you notice me with Heltah Skeltah vibing
Wack venetian blinding
Wreck from mine, charged for manslaughtering at times
The Bucktown Judy
Flow like a swan with rhymes, who you be?
The Illa
You feel me in your inner
I deliver deadly like postmen
Im holding
Hold up thats an understatement
When the beats break it ain't no move faking
Im more them FBI guys with the rude awakening
Further contemplation
May lead to some titles being taken
When its Noyz your facing
Your placed in a stressful situation

[Chorus: Illa Noyz and Heltah Skeltah]
And it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville
Yes it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville
Yeah it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville
Yes it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville

[ Ruck]
Here I am (here we go)
T-A-W
L Sean, here to bring trouble to
Phony MCs I slap em up with my pistol
Try to fuck with Ruck feel the heat from the missile
Whats the issue?
The issue is the topic at hand
Niggas rip and never say shit when the shot in my hand
Got the upperhand brotherman
Sift through the knowledge
God cipher divine rhymes will shine like polish

[ Illa Noyz ]
Demolish, Ill do just that
Abolishing funny style cats with them wack acts
Since that has been fact
The underdog from the underground
Leaves you facedown
Like a therapeutic back massage
Or police with a bogus charge
Im pulling your card
To scar is my specialty ( Yo it better be )
See you dont have your cheat sheet for this test
So take a guess
And become the one to make a rational move upon, you gone
Underestimating this Boot Camp bomb

[Chorus: Illa Noyz and Heltah Skeltah]
And it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville
Yes it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville
Yeah it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville
Yes it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville

[ Rock]
Yo, who is this doofus?
Thinking he ruthless
Broccoli your toothless
Now you sound and look stupid
You get your head spun around like a screw just
For being the only girl in the town full of men like smurf Edna
Little blue bitch
Take a foul, fuck your mama
Smack her if she never warned you about a walking bombita time-ahh
I ain't lying ya boys-ahh
Thats a fair one ask Illa Noyz ( yup, yup, yup)
And like my little nephew I break toys

[ Illa Noyz ]
Now, The Boot Campian phantoms amp son
Some of this mantel dismantle brothers with anthems
See, them sweat me like them Champion clothes
But home info
Stuck inside your head congest like common cold
When Im on flipmode
Son Rampage the stage amaze after a Spliff Star
Lord Have Mercy when I Bust them rhymes bar after bar
See my mind spray, Its no longer a hobby
Dont try me
But I put that ass to beds so pull a Javi

[Chorus: Illa Noyz and Heltah Skeltah]
And it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville
Yes it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville
Yeah it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville
Yes it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville

[Chorus: Illa Noyz and Heltah Skeltah]
And it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville
Yes it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville
Yeah it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville
Yes it does
Sound ill like noise in Brownsville
