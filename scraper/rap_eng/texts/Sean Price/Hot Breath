[Sean Price]
Heir to the throne shit
Spur of the moment
Squab with the God, best prepare for atonement
P popular but not that popular pa, I pop at ya
Rock 'em Sock 'em Robot, the knots on top of ya
Slap niggas with the Eagle, evil
That nigga Black Jack Tripper at the Regal Beagle
Bet I beast harder on a Beat Street father
Keep heat, P slaughter peeps to keep his feet [?]
Refuse to play phony
Bruise on my back, I refuse to say Toby
Disrespectful to me and my son Juxx
Cry Freedom like Kunta Kinte with one foot (Ruste)
Type far when I write, Sean crazy
Never catch my daughter with a white doll baby
Black and I'm proud, mix tobacco and loud
So I roll my own spliff when I travel around
Fire the rap, I strike when I'm hungered
Lion on my back like the King of Zamunda
Live and direct, the nine to your neck
Express way to death from Imperius Rex
P!
