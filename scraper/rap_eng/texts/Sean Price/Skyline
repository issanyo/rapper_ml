[Intro: Jesse Cash] Jesse Cash J.T. Cavey
Cityscape skeletons taking shape and growing skin
Layer and layer is peeled away
Exhausted from the repetition of always needing to rebuild
Worn down faces in colorful barren places

[Verse 1: J.T. Cavey]
City lights and skylines
Guiding home our wandering minds
Tucking us into tortoise shells
Suppressing the outside sounds of relentless consciousness
Where is contemplative terrain
That sleeps with the setting sun?
This nocturnal apathy binging on shadow and smoke
It's endlessly coming undone

[Pre-Chorus: J.T. Cavey]
When the ground falls out, who will take my hand?
When things fall apart who will take my hand?

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
I'd never thought that I could withstand
Falling short when I'm a broken man
You never knew how much I meant it in love
Every night I'm beside you weeks away when you're sleeping alone
Did you ever know how much I meant it?

[Verse 2: J.T. Cavey]
Millions of tiny pieces looking in on themselves
Reflected in the water, unaware of each other
Every piece could find its place back in the puzzle
What was one is shattered into many and longs to be whole again
But nothing ever fits quite the same in the end

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
I'd never thought that I could withstand
Falling short when I'm a broken man
You never knew how much I meant it in love
I'd never thought that I could withstand
Falling short when I'm a broken man
Every night I'm beside you weeks away when you're sleeping alone
Did you ever know how much I meant it?

[Outro: J.T. Cavey]
When the ground falls out, who will take my hand?
When things fall apart, who will take my hand?
