[Intro]:
P! Ayatollah. Jesus Price. Praise you. Hip hop Lord and savior. Jesus Price. P!

[Verse One]:
Yo, Sean Price is the nicest MC in the world to ever write a rap
Just the way I get paid I should buy some crack
I write a rap in a minute, niggas dig it for years
Cause they love it when I spit the bullshit in they ear
Yellow bus niggas can't read or write too good
But they sell white's white and they knife work good
Listen, I spit a jem star on you and your friend pah
Then spar ten rounds in your friend car
Sean a boss, I'm the best in the world
You'se a bitch and ya soft like the breast on your girl
Bum bitches suck dick for a washing set
Put a ring around the collar, holler, wash ya neck
Listen, Dikembe Mutombo, Feliz Navidad
You buy Echo to get us free like Amistad
Yo
Make some noise if you wanna receive this
Chapter one, verse one, story of Jesus
P!

[Hook]:
"Yeah, I praise you"

[Verse Two]:
Listen
It go...
Basic rap, blaze the track, state the facts add your ad-libs
Get the fuck out the booth, get paid for that
Simple mathematics, the rapture to clap bastards
Back smack rappers who actors who act like rappers
Master
Of ceremonies, ceremonies mastered
So after I rap nobody should rap after
After the laughter, comes the tears
Alcohol poured on the curb, I don't fuck with beer
Listen
Brown jeans, brown sneakers, brown hat
Brown skin brother from Brownsville, what's fuckin' with that?
I fuck up the track
Beat up the beat, snuff up the snare
Hold the hi-hat hostage till you fuckers aware
P!

[Hook]

[Verse Three]:
Ayo
Listen
Hip hop ya don't stop, ya won't pop a shell
Y'all bitch niggas is frail
I will murder things the nina
Hurricane Katrina
Hoes on the corner all gone, have you seen her?
Slackin' with my mackin'
Simpin' with my pimpin'
Ratchetpacked with gadgets, old lean I'm limpin'
Man, bust a foe
Slam shut the do'
Find 'em, fuck 'em, flee, never handcuff the hoe
Oh
The flow is outstandin'
Night time drama, the Llama have Knots Landing
God damn it
Sean's the man
The almighty, all knowin', doin' all I can
Call your fam
What the fuck is the deal?
It's Sean Price and I'm reppin' the 'Ville
Jesus

[Hook]

[Outro]:
Thou shall not fuck with the god. Or the god shall beat the earth, wind and fire out of one of you bitch ass niggas
