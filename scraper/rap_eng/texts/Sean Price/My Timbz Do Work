[Hook]
I got somethin' for that ass
Stop stuntin' on my cash
Get a slug up in your hat or a boot up in your ass
Say what say what, nigga my timbz do work
Say what say what, I put my timbz to work
I got somethin' for that ass
Stop stuntin' on my cash
Get a slug up in your hat or a boot up in your ass
Say what say what, nigga my timbz do work
Say what say what, I put my timbz to work

[Verse 1: Steele]
I was trained by the best of the worst
Call it a bless and a curse
My Smith and Wesson learned to aim it in bursts
I learned death young, believe me it hurts
My sister came in a cradle went away in a hearse
I put family first, you could get enemies with these
Who's your man at first
Take this more serious than just a verse
Some nigga's want to life their life, scared to get in the dirt
Can't afford to pay the price when you're doing that work
But look holmes, change work before you're laying in church
Face toward the lord ass to the earth
Because you played tough on the wrong turf
Let's pray if anything you learnt
When the cards get dealt fake niggas will melt
Stop following fools and believing in jerks
If you a G be a leader nigga, know your worth

[Hook]
I got somethin' for that ass
Stop stuntin' on my cash
Get a slug up in your hat or a boot up in your ass
Say what say what, nigga my timbz do work
Say what say what, I put my timbz to work
I got somethin' for that ass
Stop stuntin' on my cash
Get a slug up in your hat or a boot up in your ass
Say what say what, nigga my timbz do work
Say what say what, I put my timbz to work

[Verse 2: Tek]
I'm a Crisconstruct, black chucka, icey white T at Rucker Getting money, little tummy, hustling motherfucker
Ain't no telling where I'll be while I G
In the Mandalay on fight night or probably
OT with face in [?]
Popping Don P and Remi we hate the taste of Cris
Boy, boy I'll tell you something you don't know about me
Nope I can't do it, probably work for police
And If that's the case I got somethin' for that ass
Keep stuntin' on my cash
Catch a slug up in your hat
Cheese eater, jail cheater, snitch gone black
DB4D don't go sign for rats
That's the reason I lay low, resurrect the yayo
Soldiers on call ready to move when I say so
Seven on the come up but my number is nine
And I bring it back like mike wearing the four five

[Hook]
I got somethin' for that ass
Stop stuntin' on my cash
Get a slug up in your hat or a boot up in your ass
Say what say what, nigga my timbz do work
Say what say what, I put my timbz to work
I got somethin' for that ass
Stop stuntin' on my cash
Get a slug up in your hat or a boot up in your ass
Say what say what, nigga my timbz do work
Say what say what, I put my timbz to work

[Verse 3: Sean Price]

[Rock]
Surprise I'm back, smack earth wind and fire out of wack
Nigga you ain't even got to ask, I am ain't bout it black
You seen home improvement Wilson grill, I'm kinda that
Y'all can't see me with or without a gat
Ya bitch bastards If you ain't know when Rockness around
The rest of these clowns can't eat eggy down
Shit on you bitch niggas

Just thinking of your cream and your cheese I gotta shit

[Sean Price]
I got something for your ass
I was stuntin' on my cash
Run up in ya gun up in ya
What's fucking with that?
Say what, say what Nigga my timbz do work
You can ask Jesus Christ, I take my timbz to church
P!

[Hook]
I got somethin' for that ass
Stop stuntin' on my cash
Get a slug up in your hat or a boot up in your ass
Say what say what, nigga my timbz do work
