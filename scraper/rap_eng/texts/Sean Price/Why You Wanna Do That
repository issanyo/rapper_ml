[Chorus] [Large Professor]:
Why you wanna go and do that huh huh?
Why you wanna go and do that yeah yeah?
Why you wanna go and do that huh huh?
Why you wanna go and do that yeah yeah?
Why you wanna go and do that huh huh?
Why you wanna go and do that yeah yeah?

[Sean Price]:
Now why you wanna go and do that pa?
I'm not tryin' to curse on the track, but you need to get smacked pa
Large Pro, Jak and Craig
Wild like a cop's night stick that cracks your legs
Po' dad's killin' kid, pro black militant
Shawty rock red, black and green and she's still a slid
I said she need Allah in her life
And looked at my face and said I need a scar on the right, damn
Why you wanna go and do that huh?
Mess with my grill and get laughed at when I step in the ville
At the same time I heard a shot
In a jealous rage her boyfriend with a gun rocked shawty's knot
I told pa I wasn't tryin' to bag her
Knife to a gun fight, ?
He put the barrel to his head
He pulled the trigger and guess what I said

[Chorus] [Large Professor]:
Why you wanna go and do that huh huh?
Why you wanna go and do that yeah yeah?
Why you wanna go and do that huh huh?
Why you wanna go and do that yeah yeah?
Why you wanna go and do that huh huh?
Why you wanna go and do that yeah yeah?
