[Verse 1: JT Cavey]
Shed your skin, days on years
Punished by pressured time
When underneath, you're balancing
All this hate and selfless misconception
What once was full is just the husk
Of a deceived creature of habits
Black ink can't pierce this deep
By your side, I watched the birds of prey
Bind the skies and hold in wait
We cannot mend what is sealed by fate
No future, contentment with complacency
Absorbing disappointment, bite the hand that feeds
I gave up everything to make you feel complete
Drenched in cold sweat from lost comfort of safety
You resonate with hatred

[Pre-Chorus: Jesse Cash]
My pulse is racing in my chest
I lie awake to imagine pathways of escape as they disappear

[Chorus: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
All these words mean nothing if we fall face first
From running away from something that we saw coming

[Verse 2: JT Cavey]
Embrace this sunset as cloak and dagger for you to cower
Hidden by shadows, with filthy nails of gripping cowards
Shed your skin
Refuse to be loved by yourself to grow free from villainous vines Refuse love from anyone else to sever ties that have grown intertwined

[Pre-Chorus: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
My failing mind has been oppressed
And I lie awake to embrace a pathway of escape
Disappear without a trace

[Chorus: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
All these words mean nothing if we fall face first
From running away from something that we saw coming

[Bridge: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
Rise through the wake
Sliding through the pulse of the ocean tide
Rise through the wake
Sliding through the pulse of the ocean tide
Shed your skin, shed your skin
I've always known what's underneath
Rise through the wake or be the crashing waves

[Interlude: Jesse Cash]
Rise through the wake
Sliding through the pulse of the ocean tide
Rise through the wake
Slide

[Outro: JT Cavey]
Refuse to be loved by yourself to grow free from villainous vines
Refuse love from anyone else to sever ties that have grown intertwined
