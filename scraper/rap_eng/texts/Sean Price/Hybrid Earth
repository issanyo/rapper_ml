[Verse 1: Garrison Lee]
Interlaced fingers, the locking of hands
Omnipotence entwined with man
Alteration before conception
The pretense to coalescence to form this imperfect plan
Unconsciously bound to one another
Liberated emotions are becoming smothered
Dynamics of the absolute contort our narrow view
We were not meant for this hybrid birth
Inhumanity crowns the Earth
This hybrid birth

[Pre-Chorus]
Momentum is your venom

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Momentum is your venom
Clinging to progress, we embrace the toxin
Children of the ancients, you've forgotten innocence
Unkept instincts, enslaved, inefficient

[Bridge: Garrison Lee]
We were not meant for this hybrid birth
Inhumanity crowns the Earth
We were not meant for this hybrid birth
Inhumanity crowns the Earth
Inhumanity crowns the Earth
Designer, designer of mystification
Imposer upon a fit creation

[Pre-Chorus: Garrison Lee]
Momentum is your venom

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Momentum is your venom
Clinging to progress, we embrace the toxin
Children of the ancients, you've forgotten innocence
Unkept instincts, enslaved, inefficient

[Post-Chorus: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
Inhumanity crowns the Earth
Momentum is your venom
Children of the ancients, you've forgotten innocence
Enslaved, inefficient

[Outro: Garrison Lee]
They breathe with us, they've bred with us
They are self-proclaimed behemoths
Bound by our own desire, seduced and expired
Self-proclaimed behemoths
Bound by our own desire, seduced and expired
