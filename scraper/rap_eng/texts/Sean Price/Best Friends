"These are the makings of you"

[Verse One] [Jay Bizzy]
Okay, I started writin' rhymes a long time ago
Back when I couldn't even find a hoe
Now they show me love, like they behind me yo
Because they know I have potential to be signed with doe
Or maybe it's my charm cause when I shine I glow
And I don't see the harm in gettin' mine, you know?
But it don't happen overnight it takes time to grow
Tryin' to find my flow since I was nine years old
Stayed on my grind fo' sho', now hey, I'm a pro
Did all kind of shows, not a dime at all
But still I'm payin' dues, so what you whinin' fo?
Rap is like a mountain, need to climb it slow
Before you get to forty, got to find your doe
But don't be surprised if there's a line up yo
Pimpin' ain't for love then what your rhymin' fo?
I run a diamond store, droppin' gems since my time to go

[Chorus] [Jay Bizzy]
I remember way back then
When I was comin' up you was there for me, my best friend
Know that, you the reason why I pick up the pen
I tell the DJ to play the record again
Record again

[Verse Two] [Sean Price]
Listen
Lincoln Continental
Sean monumental, arm, leg, leg, arm
But it all start in the mental
Sean Price the government
P Body the nickname
Smoke my blunt, holdin' my nuts, watch the Knick game
Might pop a pill, but the god never sniff cane
Metro card carrier
A legend on the six train
Wack back then, matter of fact ain't shit changed
Stay cruddy nigga, I'm better than y'all
Get a knife but yet I feel it's better to brawl, nigga
Fuck it, just gutted a broad
Pussy ass nigga
For real
Ayo meet the thorough private jet plane leavin' for Cheetoborough
Now I'm broke in coach, smugglin' coke
Sean Price dope like heroine in your arm
Put the needle to my vein and remember my moms

Rest in peace [echos]

[Verse Three] [Jay Bizzy]
Okay, I remember you were my best friend
The pen in my left hand, the rest than is history
It's Jay Bizzy
The motherfucker can't play with me
So it's a cuss, ? charts to make the food, so I stay shifty
Ain't got no day job
No nine to five, I gotta play hard and take charge
And praise God
For watchin' over me all the times I knew I wasn't alone
He gave me strength on the microphone
Of course I give it all that I got
And live it up, I don't wanna wake up 40 like my life is gone
And yeah, I'm all grown, I know right from wrong
But lord forgive me if I ain't that strong
But sometimes I look back
And ask myself, "Is this all gonna pay off? I know a little cash would help."
But I'd rather live in debt than to live with regrets
It's in my heart and I could never forget

[Chorus] [Jay Bizzy]
I remember way back then
When I was comin' up you was there for me, my best friend
Know that, you the reason why I pick up the pen
I tell the DJ to play the record again
Record again
