[Intro: Ruck]
*snoring*
Bring in the next patient (the patient is sleeping)
Bring in his chart (the Doctor will see you now)
How you doin, let's see what we have here
My name is Dr. Killpatient
And I'm your psychosssssigmathetamasochistic

[Verse One: Rock]
All I, seem to, think about is violence
It doesn't matter if I'm dead sober or I'm bent
It's strange, I'm not insane or at least I don't think so
Or am I? You think so Doc, truthfully I don't know
So what do I do I go to my crew and ask for help
But they ain't no help, they go through the same shit they damn self
So I look deep into the mind of a crook
Then out of nowhere I envision two right hooks
Aww damn, again goes this shit I
Can't get out of this cycle, dish one got me whipped
From the thought of a brain bashing, Doctor stop me
Before I blow my motherfuckin top G

[Verse Two: Ruck and (Rock)]
See that leather sofa over there? (Yeah)
Sit back with this six-pack and a spliff
That have your mind twisted while we chit-chat (I like that)
I think that, we should start with the session (Uh-huh)
But before we begin let me ask you a few questions (Uh-huh)
Have you been touched the wrong way? (Nah)
Involved in gun play (Yeah)
The town let me guess acquitted like you was O.J. (How'd you know?)
Typical black life you jack knifes under a sea biscuit
Get specific and stop fuckin around wit that crack rock
(Yo I don't smoke doze)
Yes you do Duke I can tell
Cuz you actin funny, like when blacks get money
(Bummy Jab only married to Jawana
And instead of helping you're getting me heated like a sauna)
Just trying to get into your head
Pardon the way I treat you
Tell me bout your scar, did your momma beat you (Nah man)
Fuck the mystery Duke tell me your history
You're pissin me off
Plus the time keep on slippin' see

[Hook: Vinia Mojica]
I need a doctor to give me some therapy
I need a doctor to check my, my brain

[Verse Three: Rock and (Ruck)]
As I think back, to the nineties
That's when life got extra grimy
Multiplied with a fleet behind me
Wasn't smart to try me, physical fam gave less than a
Which added on to eighties anger tearing through my inner
(Now we're getting somewhere, yeah) It's all becoming clear
I always feared I have to play the rear til I was outta here
That's when I flipped out and became a plane
That transformed into a robot Rock Da Kids was his name
(One of them Decep niggas) Yup taking dope clothes and then some
I bend some (did you have any legal source of income?)
I said farewell to welfare crazy long ago
They want you to work for them peanuts now
Man you need a shrink if you think I'mma go (huh)
Then any thoughts and hopes of rehabilitation
Were chilled when I lost my nigga Phil it's been downhill
Ever since, and ain't nobody helping me
So I came to you, the Doctor Kill-patients for therapy

[Hook: Vinia Mojica]
I need a doctor to give me some therapy
I need a doctor to check my, my brain

[Verse Three: Ruck]
Bust the prognosis, better yet Duke have a dosage
Of prescribed poetry that people perceive as potent
I've been going through your file and I found a conclusion
That you destined to be the best in this world of confusion
You lose when you fall victim to evil ways
I know crime pays but the rhyme slays nowadays
Take two of these and if you have a problem at all
I'm on call twenty-four hours to brawl, word is bond

[Hook: Vinia Mojica]
I need a doctor to give me some therapy
I need a doctor to check my, my brain

[Ruck]
This is my number, yaknowhatI'msayin
4-9-5-Nevermind-Nevermind

[Hook: *until fades*]
I need a doctor to give me some therapy
I need a doctor to check my, my brain

[Ruck;*Rock*]
But you the undisputed, and now you therapeutic
Bootcamp champion
*Damn give my damn money back*
The undisputed, with therapeutic
Bootcamp champion, R-O-C, therapy
