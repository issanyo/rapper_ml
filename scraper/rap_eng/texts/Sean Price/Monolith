[Verse 1: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
Faith we abate, a perfect design of which we deprecate
We can't decipher this suppressive surge of desire
As I watch the hands of time cradle circumstance and consequence
I reiterate that the hourglass is near its end and depleting swiftly
Trace the edge along this line we drew within this narrow space

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Memories I can't recreate
Wreckage beyond what we could calculate
An affection that fluctuates
Familiar speech in a new tongue that I cannot translate

[Verse 2: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
Who's to say that our faith was kept in a safe place?
As we witness a weaker pulse and shallow breaths, the innocent fight
To take their life back, no surrender of light from their eyes
Perpetrator, give back what's not yours to keep
Stolen destinations of contingency, ripped apart and vanishing

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Memories I can't recreate
Wreckage beyond what we could calculate
An affection that fluctuates
Familiar speech in a new tongue that I cannot translate

[Bridge: JT Cavey]
These wandering eyes provide confirmation of idle actions
Holding keys to open doors, we're too afraid to enter
We scrutinize, but execution falls short
Disgust for lack of action
Cover your face with your hands and look away

[Chorus: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
Memories I can't recreate
Wreckage beyond what we could calculate
An affection that fluctuates
Familiar speech in a new tongue
Memories I can't recreate
Wreckage beyond what we could calculate
An affection that fluctuates
Familiar speech in a new tongue that I cannot translate

[Outro: JT Cavey]
Perpetrator, give back what's not yours to keep
