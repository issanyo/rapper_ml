Intro:
R-U ready....(to my west coast headz come on)
Ready...all my headz are you ready
And to my east coast headz come on
R-U-ready...I say all my peoples are you ready
And to my headz thats overseas
I say are you ready
All my people are you ready

[Louieville]
Muthafucka had it up to here
From my chest to my head
When the led paint the town red bloodshed your dead
I groove thru these pavements
We all together theres no slaveships
So run these rebels that race this
Be watchful of large cows hovering covering in the dawn
Husk its the storm, I cock back
Relax and drink the henne-vill slugga
My fleet will see ahead so we will see you sucka
Shake em down for profound sound
Punk your down by lightnin, throw your fists up cuz...

[Tek]
The escapade when its followed, move the shit from Guatemala
Move the Q-U 7 years ago wit my father
I met shorty whop at a block dice game
No words where exchanged, body language did its thang
Think I didn't when I did take honey back to the nest
Twist the back as soon as we hit the rest
Me tongue and kisses sway like a fly wind bloom
Seductivly undressed as she layed across the room
And cocked her seat up on the bed and grabbed her ankles and said
Its been a long time lets see if your ready yet

Chorus
All my peoples are you ready
R-U..all my peopless are you ready

[Steele]
We the soldiers of misfortune have fought one common cause
To keep mine and yours from fallen off
When sources uncontrollable offers coffins for all of you
Soon we'll see it might be too late to come in unity

[Rock]
Yo its on again
Wack get gone it when Boot Camp begin swarmin in
So I say all my peoples are you ready
Are you ready, not the one gas like the Getty let the
Soldiers get busy light this party like a bar-be
You too late once we start we, nothin gets copy
When squads meet, oh god we gon last
But I'm Rock and you can't escape me call me Alcatraz
Out the smash
We rock rows, I crash like a drunk driver wit his tire slashed
Punk you dont know the half and if you do
Then maybe you can fuck wit me
And my W-W-B-C-C

[Starang]
Oh, oh its my go, I blow Mc's outta the frame
Tell me that it wassnt your last l.p. to blame
So I got this shit lockdown like terrorists in airplanes
Now that my swear is complete I got no time for games
(I know)me and rino be like the lone ranger and tonto
Stickin niggas up for they weed and they pronto
I play the background call me the head honcho
Out to get mine, I ain't got no time for your convo
I got you, hak-2, hit em wit a combo
Me and ville sluggah out a shorty in diablo

Chorus

[Top Dog]
Life is a sound, we a de champions, the champions....yeeeeah
Listen to sound, we a de numba one sound, de numba ones yeeeah
For de people dem, we have to be a little stronger
All in all the Top Dog you will be wrong-
To miss, the Storm on CD-Rom
Givin you the bomb, big up to Tawl Sean

[Ruck]
From an unknown region, me and my legion
Never believe in the evil ways of a heathen
I breathe in, out improve on my physical
Trees keep me blessed, prepare for my ritual
Its critical when I belittle fools wit syllables
I choose to use cuz yall niggas is pitiful
Its difficult to see whose ready
Nocoturnal journalist racin thru crews like Andretti

[Buckshot]
As I come back on tracks
Put you in the mood to sit back and relax
I hope you cop a swat cuz what I got rocks
Your mind body and soul as I take control
Whats the definition of Buck:Force
I stayed away for 3 years but came back in the 4th
To stand alone on the throne of course
Buck B.D. the boss, the rest gettin tossed
True....

Outro:
Buckshot is here to stay you best believe it in
Now you ready for what we got
Gotta give a big big-up
To the whole conference all
Tigga, Tek and Sway, the Bay Boys in the place to be
B double O T-C-A-M-P, an we busy
Gotta big-up Illanoiz, DJ Swan, The Representativz
