[Verse 1: Garrison Lee]
Undiscovered entities
Thoughts of inconceivable beings
Universal catastrophe
They're relatives to you and me
Space and time
Emptiness lightyears wide
To discover the reasons why
We'd reevaluate, we'd reevaluate all our lives
Happenings that can't be explained
The crawling inside your brain
Unknown toxins in every vein

[Chorus: Garrison Lee]
Exo-galactic
Planetary sabbatical
Their design is tactical
Surviving is impractical

[Verse 2: Garrison Lee]
Our inferior intelligence
Versus calculating assailants
Ancient times of negligence
Eradication of our existence
Our races are being tamed
Undiscovered entities
Thoughts of inconceivable beings

[Bridge: Garrison Lee]
Creatures that became our masters
Worlds fused from disaster
Realizations too late to matter
The descent of man begins the pattern

[Chorus: Garrison Lee]
Exo-galactic
Planetary sabbatical
Our races are being tamed
Their design is tactical
Surviving is impractical

[Post-Chorus: Garrison Lee]
Happenings that can't be explained
The crawling inside your brain
Unknown toxins in every vein
Our races are being tamed

[Interlude: Garrison Lee]
Creatures that became our masters
Worlds fused from disaster

[Outro: Garrison Lee]
Creatures that became our masters
Worlds fused from disaster
Realizations too late to matter
The descent of man begins the pattern
Creatures that became our masters
Worlds fused from disaster
Realizations too late to matter
The descent of man begins the pattern
The descent of man
The descent of man
The descent of man
