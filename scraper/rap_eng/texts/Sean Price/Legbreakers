[Verse 1: Big Shug]
Two in the morning, walking through the hood
My man got a jux trying to see what's good
Got papi upstairs, heard he got the yayo
Nigga not playing, got it by the kilo
My eyes lit up like I hit the jackpot
Money come faster than selling that crack rock
Went to the car got the gun out the stash box
Had this one line in my head from 2Pac
I gotta get it, got, gots to get it
Doing this for self 'cause my man ain't with it
Knocked on the door, pulled out the four-five
When it's about that cash I be ready to dive
Pop one to the leg, put the gun to his forehead
Anybody move watch your ass get dead
I know where it's at, run back in the room
Go get that shit and I'll be on the move
Yeah

[Hook: Big Twins]
Legbreakers, so you know we not fakers
Breaking you up, nigga, is how we get paper
Please pay us, don't ever try to play us
Or we let them things go with the hollow-point chasers
Legbreakers, so you know we not fakers
Breaking you up, nigga, is how we get paper
Please pay us, don't ever try to play us
Or we let them things go with the hollow-point chasers

[Verse 2: Big Twins]
When you owe me dough, I don't hesitate, I'm hurting ya
Run up in your spot, breaking up your furniture
I'm not particular, I'll snap your fibula
You'll be telling me safe numbers while I be hitting ya
Yes, I'm a bad man, Boston's muscler
Breaking legs for dough is how I hustle ya
I don't got many friends so I'm short on emotions
So I have no problems with throwing you in the ocean
Pay me my money, C notes and more
Or get your head bashed through the front door
Ankles broke, pound driven to the floor
Whip you in the face with the butt of a forty four
I'm not playing, I'll leave you people laying
This is what happens when you're late on paying
Whipping asses for cash, some say it's old school
So I beat your ass first then I use the tool
Frank and [?] style, I rip your teeth out your head
Throw you in the back of a truck wrapped in a bed spread
Front on the dough and get your whole crib smoked
Pay me my money or get your fucking legs broke
Yeah

[Hook: Big Twins]
Legbreakers, so you know we not fakers
Breaking you up, nigga, is how we get paper
Please pay us, don't ever try to play us
Or we let them things go with the hollow-point chasers
Legbreakers, so you know we not fakers
Breaking you up, nigga, is how we get paper
Please pay us, don't ever try to play us
Or we let them things go with the hollow-point chasers

[Verse 3: Sean Price]
A-yo murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Sean Price motherfucker from the, the, the 'Ville
My pops took my moms, I'm as mean, his seed
'Cause I break legs and smoke all the greenest weed
You forgot to mention, I let the shotgun blast
I don't rock with my pops duke, my pops is ass
One, two, y'all check it out
Me wanting two checks before I deck your mouth
Listen, got my mind on my money, money on my mind
Hand on my nine par, I'm trying to get mine
When niggas act stupid when the see the gun cocked
Slapped with an elephant bone like Ong-Bak
Have my fucking money by the time the sun drop
I'mma eat your food, what the fuck in your lunchbox?
Man make the money, money make the man
Get whatever, get my cash or I'm breaking your legs Fam

[Hook: Big Twins]
Legbreakers, so you know we not fakers
Breaking you up, nigga, is how we get paper
Please pay us, don't ever try to play us
Or we let them things go with the hollow-point chasers
Legbreakers, so you know we not fakers
Breaking you up, nigga, is how we get paper
Please pay us, don't ever try to play us
