[Hook]
It go one, two, three
The crew is called B.C.C
And if you wanna get with Sean P
Grab your pistol let your clip pop
Oh no

[Verse One]
I'm the signified monkey on the tree poppin' the bullshit
Broken limbs made me fall, I'm still poppin' the full clip
In the street with my heat, never small always heavy holmes
{Spanish} ma what the fuck is that? Reggaeton?
Nah nigga get a phone
And call your man up
Tell him it's stick up when he see me, put your hands up
Man up, man what?
Y'all niggas is ass cheeks
Shit you really do would make a nigga wanna blast heat
Nah stop the violence, fuck that, let your clip pop
I need some dead prez-idents, this shit Bigger Than Hip Hop
Funny style niggas get hit, fuck is you Chris Rock?
Rich comedians be gettin' robbed for they wrist watch
Sean Price the name and, robbery's my pedigree
Kleptomaniacs is Nocturnal, I need Therapy
Dr. Phil, cop a pill, still feel no better B
Wanna live then? On my side is where you better be

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Manhattan keeps on making it
Brooklyn keep on taking it
Brooklyn keep on taking it
Yeah, Brooklyn keep on taking it
BK all day, all day BK
Big Ruck, Sean Price, Brownsville PJ's
Spray shots at gay cops like "make my day"
Make my night
Fuck around I take your life
Take my knife
Matter of fact, hold my shirt
Wanna fight pah, hold this first
Bonk bonk
Y'all know my style and respectize my technique
Mergin' with a virgin leavin' blood on the bed sheet
I love fuckin' just as much as I love shootin' shit
Red Light District got a nigga goin' Ludacris
No pun intended, gun intended to kill so
If you not with that bullshit then chill yo
Brownsville
Never ran never will
Unless you strapped and I'm not, fuck it I gotta peel
P!
