[Verse 1: JT Cavey]
Aiming soft steps along each brick
To give respect in the places unfit
It's not a waste to him, but all he knows
Avoiding all the conflict to seek some repose
Thinking back on his father's words
To try and mend the cracks at the seams
Stand your ground and speak your mind
A unity he can't emphasize
Hard rain falls without consulting the flood
A tear hits the cheek of a heartless man
Counting the minutes as you lose control
This love goes unreceived, marked "return to sender"

[Pre-Chorus: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
Feeling it all around me
Watching the clouds roll over
Fall into place; trust in the outcome
Walk along the path of least resistance

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Set your feet to paths for you to wander and never feel alone
Questioning the option to surrender, embracing the unknown on your own

[Verse 2: JT Cavey & Jesse Cash]
Walk alone or lead the pack on your own
There's no difference in numbers
If you see nothing with eyes wide open
Remembering moments being led astray
The howling voices looming close behind
Reaching for a piece to steal away
Close your doors even if the rooms are vacant

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Set your feet to paths for you to wander and never feel alone
Questioning the option to surrender, embracing the unknown

[Bridge: Jesse Cash]
Setting all the clocks to prior hours to stagger fleeting time
Saving all the love you can remember, remember

[Outro: JT Cavey]
Thinking back on his father's words
To try and mend the cracks at the seams
Stand your ground and speak your mind
A unity he can't emphasize
