[Sean Price]
Ayo words can't express the way that I feel *whistles*
Yo, ya ass is fat, ya brain is small
You slap the kids and ya chain is pawned
You look like shit, you destroying yourself
Heineken for breakfast-ass bitch
You don't even make my dick hard no more
Gotta think about my ex to get erect
Gotta take X when I'm erect
Stretchmarks, titties lookin like prunes
Fuck you with the lights off from behind in the room
My sister told me to leave ya ass alone, but fuck it..

[Sean Price]
Y'all know how I met her, we broke up & got back together
Then broke up and got back together, pshh
I love you I hate you I hate you I love you
Whatever it is, do it on the strength of your kids
When I was fucked up in the game, you held me down
I'm still fucked up in the game and you holdin me down
Listen ma, we gon' make it
Push come to shove, wrap the snub, we gon' take it
(nah mean? I love you ma) Yo, yo..
Our love is like husband & wife or a brother & sister
Unconditional love, even if I ain't with ya
'member when I fucked up, you kicked me out of the house?
Wait a minute that was yesterday!
Came through the next day, started foreplaying
You asleep but why the fuck you move ya breast this way
We ain't meant for each other
I ain't shit you ain't shit, bitch we meant for each other
Fight all day, fuck all night
Ruck ain't shit, but Ruck all right
Love my kids but got no dough
And I... love you bitch, I'm lettin you know
