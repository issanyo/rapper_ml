[Intro: Jesse Cash]
Metamorphosis; what am I becoming
Liable; or a victim of circumstance?
Bending disorder to appease my own defense

[Verse 1: JT Cavey]
This bond could not be conceived without affection and faith to believe
It was all meant to endure the worst of things
Cast aside your doubts and destructive thoughts
I know that I can finally be enough

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
The signal fire is flickering
Breaths start to cease, and I wonder
If she calls my name out from the edge of the sea

[Verse 2: JT Cavey & Jesse Cash]
Tones of crimson gleam to fill the space between
The animation in my arteries
Cruel impermanence; the weight of the unknown
Has stricken me with a feeling of turbulence
Holding out for a softer consequence

[Verse 3: JT Cavey]
Stand true; we are absolute
Doubt breathes through blushing leaves
Eradicated with my will to be
Convoluted ideas and emotions
That make their home in me, weigh me down
They make their home in me

[Interlude: Jesse Cash]
Drifting away into the comfort of false safety

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
The signal fire is flickering
Breaths start to cease, and I wonder
If she calls my name out from the edge of the sea

[Verse 4: JT Cavey]
Move in sync with passage of light
Through my fingertips
Aligned on each notch of my spine
Where shivers won't dare resist

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
The signal fire is flickering
Breaths start to cease, and I wonder
If she calls my name out from the edge of the sea
