[Verse 1: Illa Ghee]
Illa Ghee is Malcolm X with a Klan suit on
And the flow's Charles Manson in front of ya moms
Fuck a girl gone wild, I'm a tech that's gone wrong
Wolverine raps, I overlap the storm
Clap anybody who overlap the pawn
Was a street-type nigga, but trapped in Vietnam
Born Von Drago, never played the lotto
I'm springing grenades at a Vietnam model
Temper, I got a temper
I turn beef tender when the temperature rise
I'm the lord of the flies, the lord of all lords
Lord of Bedstuy, I spit in the Lord's eye
Lord have mercy
Spoonfeed water, rap's thirsty
Percocet sentence, semi-auto surgery
Overdose and mislead you
I'm every drug known to man in one needle

[Interlude]
A man becomes preeminent, he's expected to have enthusiasms
Enthusiasms
Enthusiasms

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Sean the white boy that run with the X-Clan
And the bastard that put acid in his headband
Shoot the thing sooner
Assasinate your ass, I'm Luther King Jr
Bar for bar the best barbarian, Sean
The arm, the double leg, the arm, the head and the Don
Head from a broad when I was headed to class
Bet you got a lot of kids, but I'm better with math, P
Detective Floyd, nigga
Fuck freeing my freezer, respectable four figures
My last shit was off the wall
My next one is a thriller, the gorillas invovled, P
I will rock your chin
You just another rapper, you are not my friend
Motherfucker
