Hello, I'm Sean Price
And do I have a rhyme for you!

Live shrapnel
Caught from behind, the nine slap you
You niggas can't rhyme like swine on pineapples, hold on

I tear apart your union
Sly guy drive by in the Fahrvergn√ºgen
The heart to do what I doin' so don't dare me
Posse full of predicate felons, so don't scare me
I'm rarely here, I'm rarely there
But when I'm here I'm in rare form, Norm from Cheers
I'm not the hottest rapper out
The sket'll wet you and take the hottest rapper out
Doused the flame
Big blouse, shout Elaine
Bryant
Don't try it duke, come out your chain
I shoot duke
Malcolm X before Islam in the zoot suit
P, the general hostile
True story shorty, you're a general? Not now
Food for thought, supplyin' the lunch pack
Nice sample, where the fuck is the drum track?
P
