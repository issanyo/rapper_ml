[Verse 1: Napoleon Da Legend]
Who’s the best rapper that ever lived?
Answer the question kid, the lesson is
You took more than a second then the Legend is
Prolific rap Olympic, standing on Mount Olympus
With Zeus and other gods no comparing the sound you listen
Eucalyptus you can live to this, so view my vision
Only built for Cuban Linx the game is broke so who can fix it?
Po the Pharo-Gamo, Pharaoh with ammo, M.O
Negro Modelo mellow kid you didn’t get the memo
Megalithic Sega Genesis I used to dig
Fly on my Pegasus just to spit on the face of Bigots
Check how I make my entrance, money be making interest
Love me a freak that be bending over and taking inches
Hip-Hop is never dying you should go to hell for lying
Labels present slave contracts I’m never signing
Po is a legend is he? Gotta respect the MC
I got my brethren and dead presidents to represent me

[Hook: Napoleon Da Legend]
These are words from the wise men, you should live your lives like them
Utilize your common sense get your mind bent
Words from the wise men, they telling lies my friends
Leviathan is on the rise that’s where the line ends

[Verse2: Sean Price]
Abracadabra I stab a rapper fast with my dagger
Cause every line in his rhyme is swine and dining no swagger
I’m the Master P without the tank on my neck
My crooks strong look wrong, they be shanking your neck
Mind over matter I mind your mind your mind doesn’t matter
I splatter your mind with the nine designed for reclining you bastards
I fuck up your life, fuck your whole situation
A nigga fuck you up for thinking that a nigga Haitian
You stay dank, smoking and thinking like frank ocean
Looking for a funeral face like a urinal
Juventud Guevara paul, I’m a luchador
Step on ya blue shoes while I’m looting your store
I get Rah Rah with whores, Zsa Zsa Gabor
I wild out on on tour like those shoes are yours P!
I’m the best rapper you ever heard
You hearing they broke so you ain’t hearing a word P!

[Hook: Napoleon Da Legend]
[Verse3: Napoleon Da Legend]
This is a mission brah, no competition paul
No signature no one to sign your wack petition paul
You ain’t occupying nothing and plus your mind corrupted
Your style’s suspect at the bar with 30 dollars fronting
Faking these album numbers on twitter accounts you bluffing
How’s it feel to tell your moms you ain’t amount to nothing
I be your motivation I’m a show how to lace it
Just like a pair of Jordans that comment has no relation
But that’s beside the issue just to make the rhyme continue
Rappers dime a dozen common just like baby mama issues
Here’s my prediction fam about to hit the ceiling fan
I can contaminate an ocean with a milligram
None of y’all are going ham all these rappers making spam
Y’all cats can’t even touch me even if we shaking hands
Napoleon Da Legend case you forgot the name
I got nothing to lose I got a lot to gain
