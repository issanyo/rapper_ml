[Verse 1: Garrison Lee]
In the reflection of the water's stream, I watch the current carry me
Irresolute and indiscriminate, this liquid flux is transcendent
A birth to conquered memories of sentimental quintessence
Learning to let go of oneself converts grievance into lessons

[Pre-Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Your innermost thoughts appear physically
Cataclysm is bound to everything

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
The event horizon; there is no escaping, inescapable
Light speeds, black holes, time lapse; we're unstable

[Verse 2: Garrison Lee]
To contemplate the unthinkable, break free from captivity
Envelope the atmosphere with magnetized waves of processed nerve activity

[Interlude: Jesse Cash & Garrison Lee]
Bring me back to the river's edge to bathe in consequence
Future events colliding, spoken of in present tense

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
The event horizon; there is no escaping, inescapable
Light speeds, black holes, time lapse; we're unstable
Misplaced ideals provoke tension, there is no escaping it
Dementia in this dimension

[Post-Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Our neurologic fortitude has been broken through
All of the pieces once whole have shattered in contact with you
Dementia

[Bridge: Jesse Cash]
In the reflection of the water's stream, I watch the current carry me, carry me away
Irresolute and indiscriminate, this liquid flux is transcendent, transcendent

[Outro: Jesse Cash]
Carry me away
