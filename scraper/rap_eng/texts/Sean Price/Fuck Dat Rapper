[Verse One: Sean Price]
Snipe shit 'til the clip out
On some bullshit par, like Mike Vic with the pits out
Might pike dick in your bitch mouth
She got a cut on her lip, so I can't fuck with the bitch (P!)
Hardcore rapper, all y'all rappers
Rapping that to P, I'm like, "fall back, rapper"
I heard your little song, you ain't all that rapper
Boot at the show, what you call that rapper?
I fell back but I can't chill
Now I'm back in the game like Grant Hill
Hit a moving target, motherfucker stand still
Body bitch boy leave him in a landfill
Listen, your face bent, with the fifth I shoot
Leave you in a vacant lot like Chris and Snoop (P!)
Fuck a wire though, nigga I fire fo'
Shots at your knot till you drop, bitch adios

[Hook: Sean Price]
Listen, cut that rapper, snuff that rapper
He ain't about shit, motherfuck that rapper
Listen, clutch that clapper, bust back at cha
He ain't gon do shit motherfuck that rapper
Tough talk actors act like rappers
Fuck 'em they all rappers, fuck that rapper

[Verse Two: Rock]
From backpackers to duffle bag boys
Not you par you just a bag boy
Run up on me trying to bust a rap boy
If you don't get the fu...man what the fuck is that noise?
Listen, money, get the fuck out of here
Before I make you sit there and have niggas cut half your beard
You should quit rap par you nothing
We need more lawyers and stuff, the Knicks need a new guard or something, something
I'm a douchebag, have me wash you pussies
Through you clean off stage like Akon did money
Or get my Dexter on, carve you dummies
Niggas like you, draw on your face with a marker bussy
Take your own advice, "just do you umma do me"
I'm Don Rocko, that's a common name, I know
But I don't know how I'm supposed to feel
Bomb 'em son? I'm bombing son
Who the fuck is Jay Rock to Rock Monster, come on son
That's the kind of this that feds me up
Nigga ask Mystikal don't press my buttons
Somebody gonna press their luck, if they press me duck
Wanna be me so bad? Tell your girl to let me fuck

[Hook: Sean Price]
Listen, cut that rapper, snuff that rapper
He ain't about shit, motherfuck that rapper
Listen, clutch that clapper, bust back at cha
He ain't gon do shit motherfuck that rapper
Tough talk actors act like rappers
Fuck 'em they all rappers, fuck that rapper

[Outro: Sean Price]
(Laughter)
Fuck y'all niggas man
