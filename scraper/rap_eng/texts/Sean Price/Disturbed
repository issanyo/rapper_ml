[Verse 1] Blame One
I don't care which chick docked a famous rich hip hopper
Phantom of the opera type slick, which doctor
Mad scientist, topper with the vocal, I'm current
Almost 33 homie, yeah, a hell of endurance
Young veteran, chop off the tongue and take the head of men
Young bucks know me, I ex so much better blend
I like to set a trend. Never tried to follow fools
Knowledge, wisdom all withstanding, son I never hollow jewels
Swallow the bottle full throttle just like a menace
I mash around Cali from Diego to Venice
Let me replenish. I'm far from finished, young apprentice
Lab coat on the floor, drop science in a sentence
Broken beaker, got you open to the speaker
Cats'll close a eye like we were hoping you were weaker
Nope and call me teacher fam, fuck what you heard
I'm a master of words, word, I'm mentally disturbed

[Hook] Blame One
Disturbed, I walk around like I'm wearing a crown
Talking to myself, cats steady staring me down
Clown, I heard you got lost, that could write precise
But I murderize cats on the mic to bytes

Cause I'm disturbed I walk around like I'm wearing a crown
Talking to myself, cats steady staring me down
Clown, I heard you got lost, that could write precise
But I murderize cats on the mic to bytes

[Verse 2]
Yo, this black on black crime
Pardon me my G
This black and white rhyme
Clap the black nine and smash your trash lines
Put your ass to sleep, goodnight, it's nap time
Listen, the best rapper in the world is Sean
The worst rapper in the world is you
Skank rapper having promise on
Bus back at your girl and you
Fuck you bitch niggas wanna do
Listen, flows phenomenal, off the chain
But really, take off your chain
I ain't joking around, toting the pound
Only think I'm a clown like homie the clown
I will put down the pound and pound on you
Then pick up the pound, its rounds on you (cheers)
Y'all niggas ain't ready for ruck, how you on it bitch
Hand me ya gun, let me know

[Scratches]

[Verse 3]
I'm not playing, horsing around or joking. Don't sigh kid
Sleep in my squalor, staple open your eyelids
Saw off the hand that you wrote your best verse with
It gets hectic, I protected all word smiths
I'm in the dragon's lair writing in the dungeon
Spirits of the past appear to me when summoned
I'm the mist that the winter escort in the night
I'm like photosynthesis absorbing the light
You're possessing the words you are sure to recite
Duplicating my sound takes much more then a mic
Hardcore when I write the final passage to your worldly fate
But maybe John might forgive you at the pearly gate
Set you straight and unless your great
I set back, set traps, watch you catch the bait
Always test the fate, they get kicked to the curb
So fuck what you heard, yo I'm mentally disturbed

[Hook] Blame One
Disturbed, I walk around like I'm wearing a crown
Talking to myself, cats steady staring me down
Clown, I heard you got lost, that could write precise
But I murderize cats on the mic to bytes

Cause I'm disturbed I walk around like I'm wearing a crown
Talking to myself, cats steady staring me down
Clown, I heard you got lost, that could write precise
But I murderize cats on the mic to bytes
