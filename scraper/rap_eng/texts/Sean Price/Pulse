[Verse 1: Garrison Lee]
Embraced by the fluidic abyss I adore
Engulfed in beauty that I cannot see
Pressure mounting on its floor
Granulated rock shifts beneath my feet
Accepted as a companion to the creatures
To the creatures of the current
Their fluorescent glow transcends allurement
Their fluorescent glow transcends
Join me, they motion
With cunning brilliance, brilliance veiled
I followed this muse under
Under waters, waters not sailed

[Chorus: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
And through the mineral reef beyond the shallows, into the deep
This seraph lead me into a lapse of time

[Verse 2: Garrison Lee]
A continual electric pulse of life
Solemnly staring while my eyes were wearing
The frailty of my being no longer persisted
This celestial entity that I'd been pursuing
Delivered my spirit that was forever imprisoned

[Chorus: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
And through the mineral reef beyond the shallows, into the deep
This seraph lead me into a lapse of time
Adrift in a medium aloof from reality, I gaze into an exalted mirror
Its reflection left an affection that had long been absent

[Bridge: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
A continual electric pulse of life
This creature has become my father
A giant reaping what he, reaping what he has sown
Absorbed in the darkness of glacial dead water
This sentient creature has touched the vast unknown
Touch the vast unknown

[Outro: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
Life is found where it is taken
A vapor in the wind cycles replaced when the ground is shaken
Nature is an equal to mankind
This celestial entity that I had been
Pursuing delivered my spirit that was forever imprisoned
A continual electric pulse of life
