Up early in the mornin, take position on the streets of NY
Mindstate like Bed-Stuy, either do or I die  (do or you die)
So I try not to rely on godz in times of need
And focus on my dough cause I must proceed (must proceed)
Mama used to say Id make it and I take her advice
She was on her 9 to 5, I was out on heists
Tryin to get mine, how to commit crime
Only way ma dukes find out is if I get time
Jucks after jucks, til I got hit with the book
Even though I hurt her ma dukes still looked out
Kept me strong ever since she let the seed out
The womb
Wanna take it from em, or take it to em

Whats the reason of life, stack doe or live trife
Become a family man supportin kids and a wife
Like your pops who break his back to bring home likkle scratch
Or black who pushed the Ac' OT with G-packs
Makin a killin by fulfillin dreams so by his man borne
(Who says duke is soft and  hate the ground that he walk on)
Or do I greez my steez, purchase a 2-piece
Walk in some company, talkin bout hire me
Watch your heart catch money bags
With kids from Nostrand ave
Poured out some liquor when I heard
My nigga Black passed    (pour out some liquor)
From multiple gunshots between 3 and 5
Mama always told me only the strong survive

And Now....

I realize that I gotta keep my eyes on the prize
The road of success is a long drive,                        2X
So I struggle and strive cause I'm told
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive

Only the strong survive  3x
(only the strong survive)

Now I realize, I gotta get my eyes on the prize
The road to success is a long dri-ive yeah
So I struggle and strive, just to make it right
So I been told, only the strong will survive , only the strong will
Survive

Ladies and Gentlemen
In shoes, sneakers, timbalands
Get out your seat, move your feet, with more love than Wimbledon
For who Sean Price, no relation to Vincent
Probably seen my face up in the 73rd precinct
For indecent exposure
In possesion, the verbal weapons
Cause crews to get to steppin
Your ass bettin, half steppin in my circle
Beat you til I hurt you or your face turn purple
Plus I blow the lead off, fuck up your composition
Then I cut my dreads off
Change up my description
When I cut the head off the snake who slithers and schemes (ah Ha)
In to my cypher tryin to fuck up my dreams    (and Now, and now)


I realize, that I gotta keep my eyes on the prize
The road of success is a long drive
So I struggle and strive cause I'
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Now I realize, that I gotta keep my eyes on the prize
The road of success is a long drive
So I struggle and strive cause I'm told
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Oooooh oo oo oo oooooh  5X
Only the strong survive 7X

Gotta Keep on Pushin   oohhh   yeah

Go for yours
Go for your gunz
