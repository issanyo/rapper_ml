[Verse 1: Sean Price]

Yo, it's the M.A.S.T.E.R
P, that's me nigga, Agallah
Lean a fool, when the god squeeze the tool
Set it off on a midget, the Kareem Abdul Jabbar pah
Sean a star, without the necklace
Catch a rapper slipping, his ass is breakfast
Tech-tacular, top technician, when the tech spit
With reckless abandon my blammer when this tech click
Y'all niggas bozos, juggling bowling pins
Nigga I'm fo-fo thugging, holding gems
Drop jewels, put them back on my neck
My chain vanglorious, Professor X
Wintertime shoot-outs, holding your goose down
Throw you over the roof, who got the juice now?
Yeah, Sean Price (yeah!) is the truth now
The baddest motherfucker that you heard in the booth now, P!

[Hook]


[Verse 2: Agallah]

Survival my rivals the latest arrivals
Surprise in the eyes of an idol
When I'm toting them hollows
I got 'em I spot 'em I rock 'em
His soul will just fall to the bottom
I watch 'em I blast 'em I pop 'em I won't give him an option
His sinister side is definitely riding
I'm wilding I'm stacking I'm styling
And all of the homies is violent
Denying you dying, you lying you get hit with the iron
You think that I'm flying the way that these lyrics is rhyming
This shit I'm designing it's gotta be diamond
I'm in, a state of mind to get a whole lot of dollars
Doing the knowledge the fact that you lyrically garbage
I'm a lyrical problem ready to revolve 'em and solve 'em
Spark 'em and lark 'em and park 'em and put 'em in coffins
Keep doing the talking and I'll shoot them like Christopher Walken
And since I was semen fighting the demons that evil was bought
Truly yours the boss just speaking his thoughts
The King of New York
