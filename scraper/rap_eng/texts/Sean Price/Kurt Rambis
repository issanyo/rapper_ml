[Verse 1]
Kurt Rambis
Take one for the team when the opponents disperse damage
Never gun shy, I'm always the first brandish
Pop you in the face, you ate the dirt sandwich, P
I don't rap like the rest
The rest of y'all that rap should put rapping to rest
Original gun clap, jackers packing their sket
I'm a couple of months removed from pitching crack on the steps
That shit is real, real shit, I'm rapping for real
Wrapping up bread 'til a nigga rap for a deal
You can be black or white and if your rapping is real
I appreciate that, Mac Miller is real, P
Black gorilla, the 'Ville
Where I reside I smack niggas and chill
Defending my bars first
Never respond to a fucking Kendrick Lamar verse
