[Intro: Samples]
Too many vultures in it
Fuck how your feeling, man
Statik Selektah's on the beat
How we're at it together (showoff, showoff)
We're really at it together

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
It go OG rapper, you know me smack the
Shit out of any nigga actin' like a rapper
Slap goon niggas, rap to niggas
Boot Camp, I do shows with Black Moon, nigga
Who got the props? Who got the pot?
Police comin', nigga who shot the cop?
It was that nigga Sean
OG gang leader of the Triggercons
Demo tape niggas sayin' "Yo, put me on!"
Backed out, the chrome busts a shot, a nigga gone
Shit, I'm a very mean rapper
Shoot the club up and I am never seen after
Master, rap, rap master
Chastise rappers then bury the black bastard
I pop an 8 at your ho
Sean Price, Population Control
Shut the fuck up

[Verse 2: Termanology]
Change in the Louie baggage, brains like computer hacker
Stains, when them shooters blast your brains on your bougie matress
Duck Down, Showoff bringin' that new talent
Hands full of fresh vegetables, new carrots
It's Kimbo Price and lil Manny Pacquiao
And fuck them non-believers, we got classics now
I do damage, pop you up like a juice addict
My dude savage, chop you up like a fruit salad
They lined up just to tell that boy Danny "Hi!"
They're sniffin' white more white than Jamiroquai
You all claim you're the God, but won't dare to die
You shook like Craig Mack in front of a camera guy
Huh, I'm picky with my broads
So y'all starin' at me like Nicki Minaj thongs
Whole blicky's the crime boss
(?) so we stay on the five arms
