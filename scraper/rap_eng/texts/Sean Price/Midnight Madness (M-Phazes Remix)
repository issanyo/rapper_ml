[Intro: (Rock), Sean Price]
(Yeah get 'em, yeah get 'em)
What up Rock?
Yo

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Midnight Marauders, motherfucking madman
Let the madness begin, I'm tapping your chin
Box your grill, smoke on some pot and chill
Then pop a pill, shorty wop, [?] and drill
Sean is a beast, you can shave the hair off my feet
Concreate flow, duke I spit nothing but street
Ladies Love Cool James but they hate Sean P
Ike Turner impersonation have 'em thinking I need
Shit, back to the rhyme again
Drug trafficking, black Africans drinking Heineken
Shaka Zula, pop a rocket through your Fubu
Who do you, think you are par? You're rap's doo-doo, I'll shoot you
I'm not like these rappers, flashing their pants, dance steps
Fuck a rapper
Ruck is after the gold then after the platinum
Beef after that Hurricane Starang pack the gat son
One!

[Scratching]
"Heltah Skeltah set it off"
"Let the madness begin"
"Heltah Skeltah set it off"
"Let the madness begin"
"Heltah Skeltah set it off"
"Let the madness begin"
"Heltah Skeltah set it off"
"Ruck and Rock set it off"

[Verse 2: Rock]
I got too many niggas I hate, only one night to kill 'em
So gun shot auctions, sold to the highest bidder
Ain't no room for you chumps here with Ruck and 'Catraz
The young black, thug rap, Odd Couple is back
Felix Anger and Oscar MegaSean
What's fucking with that...
(Cricket sound)
..Crickets, nothing exactly
If we ain't bubble from rap, we ain't getting no jobs you bitches
Son might hustle some crack, I'm goin' back to robbing niggas
And I don't give a fuck if it's platinum or white gold
As soon as that hammer click, you come out that ice yo
You disrespect the jux and it's simple
We light your ass up with something so big you can hear in the next time zone
At Midnight niggas fight, kick, bite
Scratch if your [?] get sniped
You the bitch type, Me?
I'm The Beastmaster god par
Communicate with all sorts of animals, sick 'em on ya
I'm a Monstah

[Scratching]
"Heltah Skeltah set it off"
"Let the madness begin"
"Heltah Skeltah set it off"
"Let the madness begin"
"Heltah Skeltah set it off"
"Let the madness begin"
"Heltah Skeltah set it off"
"Ruck and Rock set it off"

[Verse 3: Sean Price]
A-yo
Bust the led at your white-t, bad aim
Bust your head to the white meat
Ravishing Ruck Rude eat food with big guns
Chicks run when they see the size of my dick son
Pedophile bullets that'll touch the kids
Barbecue bullets touch your ribs, let's eat
Yo the east is back, police get clapped
Sean Price and the beast is back
Motherfucker

[Verse 4: Rock]
Yo, it's going down tonight, it's sounding like
A massacre in the making
Rounds will fire right in your face, stay in your crib
"Tonight's Da Night" and my niggas ain't playing, you dig?
We transform like MJ and them did in "Thriller"
Fuck The Amityville Horror
I ama the horror of da 'ville, man I'm a monster
I blam at your father, from rooftops and glam at the coppers
Oh shit, god damn it the choppers, we got to go nigga

[Scratching]
