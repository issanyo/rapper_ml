[Intro: Sample]
Yakub, maker and creator of the devil. Swine merchant... your time is near at hand. Fuck with me and your time will be now
Soon all devils heads will roll. And new rivers shall flow through the cities created by the blood  of whitey, salaam alaikum

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Bang bang boogie, up jump the boogie
Nigga's gangbang like Tookie
You upchuck some cookies
Forever shots clapping, metal pop blasting
Yet I stop Ock but I never stop rapping
Back to the Action Jackson Five with Randy
Slap open handed on camera fam you candy
Ruck wiser, Budweiser, African king poster
The tire traffickin' green soldier
The boss words wicked with this fucking rap
Lacoste shirt sickly with the bucket hat
Sean is the great, dawn of the ape
Performing eight days straight
Great race for the cake
P!

[Verse 2: Rim]
Ready Dosha, leave you kosher
Fluid with the flow, I treat the beat like a coaster
You off coast, you land dry, you don't wanna try
I'm tectonic plates with the rap, it's a landslide
Ran a flat tire couldn't ride nor [?]
You hide on pen, with piss like a wino's den
I'm a barber, line the beat
I breathe to tweak
It's beef and I'm [?] if you eat we eat
Brownsville the [?] bullies, we [?] fully
So won't even pop, just straight up pass you a buoy
Coffin corpse [?] verses
Met to [?] shit, I'm the rhyme Kevorkain
I clear it, when I tear vocals, never off duke
Postal with the delivery, get your [?] filled
Put up your dollars, get schooled like a scholar
With Rim in the stu' he brew with no Kabbalah
