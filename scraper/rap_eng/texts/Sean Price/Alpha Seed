[Intro: Garrison Lee]
We begin the fall of the Omega generation

[Verse 1: Garrison Lee]
I'm left gasping for a breath of air
In this failing body and fading beauty
I reach for what was never there
But I'm still reaching for some reason
Teach me to navigate the stars
And use the wind to guide my way
If night and nature are my only hindrance
Then let me see the light of day

[Interlude: Garrison Lee]
Unheard of is the language that lured me in
It's deeper than the surface resting just beneath the skin
Unheard of is the language that lured me in
It's deeper than the surface resting just beneath the skin

[Pre-Chorus: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
Coated by the stratified soil of my settlement
I dream of lives I've lost and enduringly lament

[Chorus: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
Unfinished pillars of our generation
Personifying this falling nation
People and animals alike
People are animals at night
Reverting back to their natural state
When law was shapeless and held no weight
We live in caves buried in mountains
Stalactite supports without foundations

[Verse 2: Garrison Lee]
We are our fathers' bastard children
Evolved from cursed seed, but we're not helpless
We will become the rebirth of hope
This steadfast campaign remains relentless
We will remain relentless

[Chorus: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
Unfinished pillars of our generation
Personifying this falling nation
People and animals alike
People are animals at night
Reverting back to their natural state
When law was shapeless and held no weight
We live in caves buried in mountains
Stalactite supports without foundations

[Bridge: Garrison Lee]
We begin the fall of the Omega generation
Coalescence of Omega children
Take my hand, the new world begins

[Chorus: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
Unfinished pillars of our generation
Reverting back to their natural state
When law was shapeless and held no weight
Personifying this falling nation
We live in caves buried in mountains
Stalactite supports without foundations
Unfinished pillars of our generation
I dream of lives I've lost enduringly
Personifying this falling nation, falling nation
