[Verse 1: Sean Price]

Listen, motherfuck you and whatever you stand for
Shoot the club up, leave blood on the dance floor
Niggas can't score, the game is fucked up
That ain't true, Ruck, that's just your dumb luck
Stupid ass niggas, Ruger blast niggas
Roll the kush, light it up to and pass niggas
You still ass nigga, shoot the fair one
To constitute your style I got the right to bear guns
So I walk around town with the pound strapped down
Back a nigga down, slap him with a round
Niggas claiming they kings 'til I clap in in the crown
Now he the court jester, we laughing at you clowns
Laugh now, cry later
You kiss my ass goodbye but I'm back, hi haters
Welcome to Bucktown USA
Where I slap niggas using the trey-eight all day
