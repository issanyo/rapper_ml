[Verse 1: Ian Eubanks]
Indifferent feelings yield a drain of ambition
Take me back to the days when I felt momentum
Retract the ground from beneath my feet
Every step that I took was a long stride toward my destination
This is a beautiful dream undeserving to be held in smug contempt
Grasp what you have, value that, and never let it go

[Pre-Chorus: Ian Eubanks]
The word repetition becomes the word consistency
Never let it go
The word change becomes the word new
Never let it go

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Bring me back down to humility
Teach me the value of holding onto
Bring me back down and show me the safety of letting go

[Verse 2: Ian Eubanks]
The loved ones around me who make me the best that I can be
Are the ones who'll solidify my legacy
As a fulfilled human being joyous
And humbled by the gracious gift of love

[Bridge: Jesse Cash]
The dreams that I have followed are breathing lungs full of air
Right before my eyes, the safety in letting go
Right before my eyes, the safety in letting go

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Bring me back down to humility
Teach me the value of holding onto
Bring me back down and show me the safety in letting go

[Verse 3: Ian Eubanks]
Drive and compassion are the forces that make living meaningful
And instill within you the spark to ignite the flame
The spark to ignite the flame
Grasp what you have, value that, and never let it go

[Outro: Jesse Cash]
The dreams that I have followed are breathing lungs full of air
Right before my eyes, the safety in letting go
Right before my eyes, the safety in letting go
