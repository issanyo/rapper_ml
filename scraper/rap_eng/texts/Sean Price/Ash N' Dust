[Verse 1: Sean Price]

Aqua bubble, pop the crohn's
My gun, eight kids nigga octomom's
Stop it Sean, I'm a prophet naw
I profit off of rap nigga, proper bars P!
Disturbing the peace, absurd on the beats
I'm the nicest nigga out, dude that's the word on the street
Word to my mother, let me have a word with your mother
I beat the breaks off the bitch, tell the truth like sojourner
Sean is nothing to play with
I play with the eight fuck around get your face-lift
Ape shit, banana clips duke
Pandramic view on how I ate shit, listen
I make hits, you take hits, you fall down
I'm great bitch, I shake shit, you all clowns P!
Forever repping the new shit
I'm old school duke, I will step on your new kicks
Yes, no PCP, just me Sean P with the D.O.D

[Chorus:]

We blast em before we ask em the question!
The answer, never has to be mentioned!
Disaster is our average intention!
Cause after us... it's ash n' dust!

[Verse 2: Skits Vicious]

Sick flow, Skitzo, Phrenic, Indo, addict
Spit slow, Skits tip toes in your attick
Give no shit, so watch me do the damage
When I vanish, all I leave is ashes
I travel to my shows on a black stallion
Attaching your skull to my necklace of headless
Infected with madness, injected with poison
Bane with venom tube plugged to the brain
Let it rush thru my vains, I'm way beyond pain
Fuck diamonds I got a saw stuck to my chain
And I'm moving my middle finger up in the game of rap
Everyday there's a new face to aim it at
Take a step thru the quicksand, take a nap
When your neck's in my grip and I make it snap
Crack your top like a beer cap
When my Glock's to your temple, I think that it's clear that...

[Verse 3: Jay Reaper]

We blast em, before we ask em the question
It's best that I mention my passive aggression
Cause I'm back to bust got a massive rush
Hazardous as fuck, and I see enough cats to crush
I'll catch a bus put yo ass in cuffs
But for the cuffs and the bus I don't even have cash enough
So pass the stuff is it acid or dust
A real nasty motherfucker, nigga that's what's up
And fat ass sluts that got a fuckin' ass to touch
I'll fill those asses up like puttin' gas in trucks
I can't help it I'm selfish I never pass a buck
Being me is bad luck, I'm cracked up and mad stuck
Like cassius I'll bash up any punk his ass mush
Clashes of the titans and the godz that's us
I'll stab em up like he crack to cut
Cast the guts ya'll motherfuckers actin' lush
I mastered dutch with a passion I'll be scratching nuts
Cause after us there's no more than ash n' dust
