[Intro: Junior Reid]
Rastafari-ari
Haile Selassie eye
[?] limit us, oh
Empress [?] queen [?], oh

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
Ah when the church bell ring
And you hear the fat lady sing
Them shooters never ever try this again
Man dead, we shot with fire
No start no fling, no, oh
When the church bell ring
And when the fat lady sing, oh, oh
Them shooters never mistaken
Man dead, we shot with fire
No start no fling, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
P too [?]
Screamin' on the corner like a Hebrew Israelite (P!)
Frightened with the titans
Wolf thug love, niggas is likin' the lycan
Bullshit thugs get a knife to your Nike and
Pop your air bubble, yeah niggas don't fear trouble
Uh, the men pop thirty
Off digital jam, the Hancock Herbie
Go, P, a thug in his essence
Fuck faggots, unrequited love is the message
Sean poppin' for the nation
Or pay him, non-non-profit organization
Uh, I beat your ass for free
Then sip weed grass with Talib Kweli, P

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
Oh, yes, sing
Ah when the church bell ring
And you hear the fat lady sing
Them shooters never ever try this again
Man dead, we shot with fire
No start no fling, no, oh
When the church bell ring
And when the fat lady sing, oh, oh
Them shooters never never mistaken
Man dead, we shot with fire
No start no fling, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Yo, uh, to whom it may concern
I'm not concerned with whatever this shit may concern
My eighth burn in place, your ashes in the urn
Compassionate with rappin', lot of action with the words
I'm what you hope to be, vocally
Socially a misfit, loco with the biscuit
Uh, cry ouch when I enter
My GemStar make your Goose fly for the winter
No fashion, or fad
Drug traffickin', rappin', stashin' the smack in the cab
African-American, more American than African
Crackers wanna put me in the box and send me back with them
Top five, I'm top gun
Rappers all wack with the raps, but not son
Nigga, you fell for the knife's slaughter, fool
Sean cool, in Hell with ice water, P

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
Ah when the church bell ring
And you hear the fat lady sing
Them know them shooters never mistaken
Man dead, we shot with fire
No start no fling
Oh, when the church bell ring
And when the fat lady sing
Them shooters never mistaken
Man dead, we shot with fire
No start no fling, no

[Outro: Poppy]
Today we're going to learn how to play the P Chord. The first thing you wanna do is get your fingers in this position. And if you lift your middle finger, it becomes a P Minor
