[Sample]
Look bitch I'ma call you back

[Intro]
What up Crummie Beats?

[Verse 1: Illa Ghee]
I done been on the strip and I been in the trap
A few slugs bust at me but your boy bust back
I'm the man, I manhandle man in manor
I got nails from blood sales and email cantor
I'm E pills
My rap flow is equal to eels
Came home and stabbed something when I beat the appeal
Can't beat me
A beast when I beat up beats
I post bail off a cellphone for smacking a priest
You see bitches love confidence
I put a bullet in your common sense
Dominant while shitting on your monument
Abstract abeyance rock is a launch
I'm top toxic
I dare to hear a rapper response
Use pen ink inside crayons
And spit the seance
Your face [?] for facing my live lyric liaison
Illa calm response with teflon
Ring the alarm, I do mean harm
Come on

[Chorus: Sean Price]
Metal Detectors
Detect the metal then your level defected
Respect the rebel the devil deflected
Decept the cheddar your ghetto's affected
Metal Detectors
Detect the metal then your level defected
Respect the rebel the devil deflected
Decept the cheddar your ghetto's affected

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Al Sharpton marching for peace
I'm starting, no smarts when I bark at police
Decrease police abusing
[?] make heat, increase peace movements
I don't do speeches
I preach contracts black and smack dudes frequent
Sean will spray sooner
Gotta play the shooter the modern Hardaway Jr
Pain administer
Distribute the cocaine, the game is sinister, P
Ruck be reckless
Stolen necklace, playing Chuck D records
Motherfucker

[Chorus: Sean Price]
Metal Detectors
Detect the metal then your level defected
Respect the rebel the devil deflected
Decept the cheddar your ghetto's affected
Metal Detectors
Detect the metal then your level defected
Respect the rebel the devil deflected
Decept the cheddar your ghetto's affected
