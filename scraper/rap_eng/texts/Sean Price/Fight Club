[Intro]
What up Crummie Beats?

[Verse 1: Illa Ghee]
Impossible my flow knock the walls off of hells kitchen
Hell of a vision
I body into hell, listen
Master park shootouts I'm after dark routes
Knock on your door and throw a shark inside your house, nigga
Open wide I made metal wolves cry
With your misfortune and catastrophic collide
The reason that I'm high is 'cause my momma just died
I didn't even cry I just tried to murder the sky
Another level my inner soul was embezzled
Act disrespectful, my shooter rating successful
I'm hood fights, I'm the six bullets that hit Suge Knight
Nothing sugar here, I'm the nigga from the brook nights
With no emotions see I vocally pop guys
Pop goes the weasel, smoke spinach I'm Popeye
Glock threads the needle, Dessert Eagle the flock fly
Fall into apocalypse an animal archive
Illa!

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Barbarians
Best friends with Illa Ghee, I see y'all scared of him
Fuck rap, they gotta be crooks
Shook over shit, written in Prodigy book
Real shit, fam damn and quick to cut a head
Field trips, ham sandwich with the Wonder Bread
Slap hoes, eat bacon
Clap toast, feet shakin'
So tough this nigga Ruck
Write something better, so what I don't give a fuck
Never ran, never will
Then I ran when that mans hand's on the steel
I'll be back though
I'll be strapped, clap gats at black folks
Decepts jumping your kids
No black on black crime, I just hunt where I live
P!

[Outro: Illa Ghee]
Off the top this will body your night club
Who wanna die against this lyrical fight club
Fuck a rapper ain't nothing here like us
Who want to die agains this lyrical fight club
Off the top this will body your night cub
Who wanna die against this lyrical fight club
Fuck a rapper ain't nothing here like us
Who want to die agains this lyrical fight club, nigga
