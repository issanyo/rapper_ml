Understand (Heltah Skeltah only mean war)
(Understand) the war’s with everything outside your door
Understand (he be R-O, I be R-U)
(Understand) {it can happen to you}

[Verse 1: Ruck]
Heltah Skeltah starts
Storming.  Your life of dreaming, this morning, I’m warning
People who jeal, my name ring bells like a doorman
A warrant for the arrest of a militant menace
Who serve heads like tennis with words that diminish
Bust the scrimmage, I call the high post play
Dish off to the center for the quick lay (Lay)
Slay (Slay).  Anybody come in my lane
Gets blown out the frame by the Flipsta of lames—look
Who is this getting swift with this pugilist
Equipped with the lyrical gift to flip scripts?  People
Duck sick (What?), don’t wanna touch with that rough [shit]
That Ruck kick, break boys’ bones like Roy Jones
Decoys roam, but they can’t mess with my people
He who step to the Ruckus recognize that I be lethal
My gats spits at wack [shit], blacks kick tactics
Make it hard for any infiltrator to attack this

[Hook: Rock, (Ruck), and {Rock & Ruck}]
{Understand} Heltah Skeltah only mean war
Understand (the war’s with everything out your door)
(Understand) I be R-O, he be R-U
{Understand it can happen to you}
Understand (Heltah Skeltah only mean war)
(Understand) the war’s with everything outside your door
Understand (He be R-O, I be R-U)
{Understand it can happen to you}

[Verse 2: Rock]
I really think I oughta
Tell ya before I have to belt ya: I’ll make [shit]
So hot, boy, the heat might even swelter or melt ya
I nailed ya.  [Nigga] tried to yell, but he felt the
Shell, now in Hell, wondering, “Who’s Heltah Skeltah?”
Sparsky and Dutch, Ruck and Rock, see, we gets
Buckwild on your block and harass the cops
No diggy, my head’s hot, scream loud and clear
Watch the red dot.  Move a muscle?  Boy, you bed’ not
See, the last two figures, they can’t describe me
Military Punisher, Rock M.P.  Watch
The nine millimeter brain-beater
[Nigga], you won’t be beefing, and your heart won’t be beating either
Either you’re real or I hate you, I’ll break you
Like glass (*shatters*), the bullet brings it to that ass
Fast or you’ll talk faster, my gun buck faster
I jet fast to the next L spot

[Hook: Rock, (Ruck), and {Rock & Ruck}]
Understand (Heltah Skeltah only mean war)
(Understand) the war’s with everything outside your door
Understand (he be R-O, I be R-U)
(Understand) {it can happen to you}

[Verse 3: Ruck]
Understand
In the midst of utter confusion, I got something for stars (What?)
Fronting in cars and bars when I lace you with my Gemstar
Recognize real, never the rap that’s grungy
But my “pow” make your [shit] snap like bungee (What?)
Once we unite like I’m Martin Luther
I’m starting to shoot the people messing with my future (What?)
So who’s the wiggy that wanna test me and address me?
Just to try and impress me, them people come and stress me

[Verse 4: Rock]
Understand to be the man ain’t even the plan
But stand in my way and get crushed under sand
So guard your backs, or, matter fact, guard your naps on
Down ‘til we U, click your heels times—atta
I’m at the door, bringing war to your town.  It’s
The Rock, now you gotta “Get Away” like Bobby Brown.  I
Gets down, talk gets pounding like fractions, worlds
Get blown when Ruck and Rock start overreacting

[Hook: Rock, (Ruck), and {Rock & Ruck}]
Understand (Heltah Skeltah only mean war)

Understand (he be R-O, I be R-U)
