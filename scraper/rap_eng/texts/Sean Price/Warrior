[Verse 1: Ian Eubanks & Jesse Cash]
Centuries of terrestrial life force flowing through our fingertips
Spirits of our ancestors guiding our hands
Supernatural entities benevolent and fused with nature
Blessing our minds with endearing wisdom and the passion of warriors
A lone stranger will come to save us
A brewing tempest in the skin of a man
Brace for stainless steel
Rendered useless by hand carven passion of the arrowwood
We willing martyrs will die to grant our people their better days

[Bridge: Ian Eubanks & Jesse Cash]
Wolves behind the masks
Provoke conflict on our soil
Wolves behind the masks
The cowards descend upon the weak
Wolves behind the masks
Walking in our brother's skins, calling our home their nation

[Verse 2: Ian Eubanks]
Legendary malevolent creatures seeking souls to devour
Shaping shifting monstrosities, grinding their teeth, fuck
Warrior bloodlines flow through me
Brace for stainless steel
Rendered useless by hand carven passion of the arrowwood
An omnipotent stranger appears and pauses battle with thunder in his words

[Chorus: Jesse Cash & Ian Eubanks]
I am the silence in piercing sound
Keep me close to you now
I am the shadow that tames the moon and paints the earth
When you feel the heat of that crushing moment
Stand by me and never feel alone
I am the silence in piercing sound
I am the night

[Verse 3: Ian Eubanks & Jesse Cash]
Breaking the walls that barricade our passion, crushing fear
I am the shadow that blackens the moon
A lone stranger has come to save us
A brewing tempest in the skin of a man
The brave warrior cast out the darkness
His words of thunder now calm as the wind

[Chorus: Jesse Cash & Ian Eubanks]
I am the silence in piercing sound
Keep me close to you now
I am the shadow that tames the moon and paints the earth
When you feel the heat of that crushing moment
Stand by me and never feel alone
I am the silence in piercing sound
I am the night

[Outro: Ian Eubanks & Jesse Cach]
Wolves behind the masks
Provoke conflict on our soil
Wolves behind the masks
The cowards descend upon the weak
Wolves behind the masks
Walking in our brothers' skins, calling our home their nation
Break the walls
Breaking the walls that barricade our passion, crushing fear
