[Sample]
With a message for my people

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Listen, the hottest MC in the game is tight wack
Lot of MCs in the game are like that
I might smack your face off G.P
P-B-C-C-I-V-E-D
Yes, the chief ruler
Malvo, Paul the heat street shooter
Wig splitter of a big chain snatcher
Like a nigga bit a hit a rib cage rapper
Bom, shells graze windshields
Punch your face off
What the hell, Dave Winfield
I will stab your father
Slice your face artwork, Magna Carta
Yes, P's get strong
You dine and wine the pussy, Keith Sweat songs
Pop the face of a bastard
Nine to five killing , the occupational hazard

[Interlude]
What are you doin' over there?
Put that mic down man
And listen to the Songs in the Key of Price
You might learn somethin'
C'mon

[Verse 2: Illa Ghee]
The loud got me asian
Clap you with the force of your car door chasin'
Illa Ghee's bars is a statement
My state of mind stuck in the state pen
My flow's radiation
My flow is the king of the jungle inside the basement
Salutations, three thousand miles to Graceland
I fuck more than Wilt Chamberland
Bullets in the chamber, I check jaws from bangers
Rap drug slinger, my anger was all anger
Criminal dialect, I devastate danger
Fire to a forest ranger
Rifle long range painter
Head from a chick's a no-brainer
Two piece your nose and leave blood on your clothes
Nose to the head and left brains on your pillows
Ain't nothing gonna stop me
I'm rap like I'm stabbing the judge and then [?]
