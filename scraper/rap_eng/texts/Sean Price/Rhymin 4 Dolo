[Intro: Sean Price talking]
Nahmean? Niggas talking 'bout "Yo son what up man? What up with you and Rock man? Man what's popping? What up with Buckshot, what up with the crew, what up with the Click man?"
E'rything cool man, just get off my fucking dick man. Let me breathe easy duke. Let me do me and and for the rest of y'all niggas, here go y'all answer, listen

[Verse]
S to the izz E
A to the izz N
I'm rhyming for dolo cause I got homos for frizzends
Can't we get along? I don't think so
Used to be my man but now I don't think so
Think I'm crazy then, well fuck it I'm on the brink yo
You can rubber room and cuff me up in the clink yo
Y'all got problems
I ain't concerned with that
You want to fix 'em bitch, learn to rap
Fuck mine, fuck yours
Touch doors, buck four, Ruck raw pa, cause the motherfucking nut raw
Niggas in the back like, "Man, that nigga Ruck soft."
Scheming on my son cause they know the nigga truck horse
Fuck you, I'm in the strip club ready to rub soft
Titties, duck laws, pity but I got a nut off
Still the same nigga, fried rice, chicken duck sauce
You a bitch that switch that's why you got cut off
See my squad, listen, I could never be a fraud
You'se a bitch nigga doing dance steps in leotards
Fuck a friend duke cause most is fake
Read 1-20 lessons eating Hostess cakes
Duke I hate niggas like you
Fake niggas like you
Take niggas like you
Shake niggas like you
Punch you in your face, straight break niggas like you
When I'm high, no telling what the fuck Ruck might do
Got weed and clothes, so you high
So you fly
You got guns? So do I
Can't believe you bitch niggas didn't notice my
Gun out walking down the street so you die
S to the izz E
A to the izz N
I'm rhyming for dolo cause I got homos for frizzends
S to the izz E
A to the izz N
I'm rhyming for dolo cause I got multiple frizzends
