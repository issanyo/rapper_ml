[Verse 1: Illa Ghee]
Poppa Illa, Poppa Large
Proper camouflage
I gotta proper forty eagle aim it at the sergeant
Let 'em bark like a penny bull
Pity the fool, fool your flow's pitiful
Simply on the interlude
Higher power
The weed's a little sour
I'm not a Puerto Rican but I'm speaking to you cowards
Shower posse rap
All my guns is pointed down like a symbol of a Pontiac
Illa is insomniac
Manic maniac
Vocals is a mirror of his habitat
Raw butter moving like an acrobat
Awesome the killer with a polo
Boss Quasimodo, the hands of the devil caught in the photo
Shadowed out a image
I'm tryna end you niggas like the man with a vengeance
Or a battle rapper sentence
My battle rap's punching your door right off the hinges
A workaholic that's going forward on forth and inches
Illa

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
All praises due 2pac by the locker
Watch who you call crazy Q
The best verse on the song
The best song on the album
Album better than yours for sure
P, valedictorian touring scoring mad money
Blast dummy, Sean on my cash, caught a gash from me
The cannon will reck you, animal service
I'm Hannibal Lector, you Hannibal Buress
Worthless, piece of shit rapper, pop the piece at you
Don't say peace after I proceed to pop the piece rapper
Bong, might trap you off
No whites in the 'Ville but chill with Mike Rapaport
My sound is really the facts that let the pain in
My crown is merely a hat that let the rain in, P
