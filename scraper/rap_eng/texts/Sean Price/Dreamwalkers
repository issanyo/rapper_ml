[Verse 1: Garrison Lee]
In my grasp are my dreams personified
A unity of fiction and reality
The birth of beauty, the only one of its kind
Its grace exceeding limits set by the sky
Years had come and gone and my desire with them
A caged perpetuation of hope
A tally kept upon my body of days I care not to know

[Interlude: Jesse Cash]
So effortless, I seemed to let myself decline

[Verse 2: Garrison Lee]
Loss of the ambition, I pushed my dreams aside
Am I the cause of our descent, or are we chained to anchors?
Mine engrossed in rust while yours still gleams and shimmers, renew my albatross
So it shines with yours in the beams of suspended radiance
That are cast upon the ocean floor in ever-changing gradients
Renew my albatross so it shines with yours

[Chorus: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
Sinking down, am I the cause of our descent?
Are we chained to anchors pulling ourselves below?
Descending into passivity, I'm becoming what I am not
A selfish being consumed by adverse thought

[Post-Chorus: Garrison Lee]
In my grasp are my dreams personified
A unity of fiction and reality
Birth of beauty, the only one of its kind

[Bridge: Jesse Cash]
So effortless, I seemed to let myself decline
That with the loss of, of the ambition, I pushed my dreams aside
Sinking down, sinking
Are we chained to anchors pulling ourselves below?

[Chorus: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
Descending into passivity, I'm becoming what I am not
A selfish being with relinquished feelings, consumed by adverse thought
Am I the cause, am I the cause of our descent, or are we chained to anchors?
Renew my albatross so it shines

[Outro: Garrison Lee]
Am I the cause of our descent, or are we chained to anchors?
Mine engrossed in rust while yours still gleams and shimmers, renew my albatross
So it shines with yours in the beams of suspended radiance
That are cast upon the ocean floor in ever-changing gradients
I pushed my dreams aside
