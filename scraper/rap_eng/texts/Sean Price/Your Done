[Verse One: Sean Price]
A-yo
Sean Price, A.K.A. turkey and cheese sandwich
Mayo, lettuce tomato, weed and yayo
Aggravated assault, homicide in the first degree
Is what happen when niggas hear a verse from me
Living in scandal, knocked out Livingstone Bramble
Dug in his pocket and took all of his money to gamble
Listen, duke I send ya, to hell
Buck thirty three times par, Lew Alcindor
That's when the AK popping
I push your shit way back like J.J. pops
Plus your man really scared
Me and Flood coming through like Ganz and Billy Bear
I give you "48 Hrs." to get your shit together
Whatever just order some flowers
Tulips and daffodils
Put two lips on my dick and I blast in her grill

[Hook: Flood]
Fronting
You saying that you will, but you not
You Fronting, I see you like a satellite dish
Dumb
You saying that you looking for me
Knowing you can't do a damn thing to me
You see me, you done
You saying that you will, but you not
You Fronting, I see you like a satellite dish
Dumb
You saying that you looking for me
Man listen, look who I done brought with me
You see me, duck

[Verse Two: Flood]
Who that is? Flood and the BCC
Now that's real thug shit like Eazy-E
And I can get on BET with my greezy G
But I be on the block ducking from the TNT
Now blowing up like TNT
Raised in America born a TNT
Niggas hating on the kid, don't want to see me breathe
'Til I roll up, make them say "Run" like DMC
That's right motherfucker I'm the emcee
And I don't want recognition just D-O-E
Savage for the cash and the cheddar
I heard you got a vendetta but your flow dead
You fucking with Flood, Sean Price from the camp
I know you wanna do something but what? You can't
Be careful what you write, 'cause the streets is listening
Be careful when you hype next day you different
Even in the night when birds is whistling
I be on a bike creeping on your motherfucking ass

[Hook: Flood]
Keep fronting, you saying that you will but you not
Fronting I see you like a satellite dish
Dumb
You saying that you looking for me
Knowing you can't do a damn thing to me
You see me, you done
You saying that you will, but you not
You Fronting, I see you like a satellite dish
Dumb
You saying that you looking for me
Man listen, look who I done brought with me
You see me, duck
