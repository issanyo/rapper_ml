[Verse 1: JT Cavey & Jesse Cash]
Treading waters poisoned by timeless intoxicants
Always knowing that a darkness will find us
Scaling walls of imagined boundaries
We are the reapers of shame, the successors of pain
I could follow you down
To the bottom of your solemn state
Straining to pull you out
Of the trenches that your mind creates
Hesitation sits in hindsight of the blind man
Cut me open

[Chorus: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
Won't you follow tonight, just breathe in slowly
I don't wanna see you suffer forever, forever

[Post-Chorus: Jesse Cash]
You are seemingly safe and sound
But you carry such a heavy weight
A spirit that slowly drowns
But the body doesn't translate

[Verse 2: JT Cavey]
Bolstering the need to feel accomplished
Overshadowed by decisions of finite progress
A moment to take my time
To let the noise subside
Maybe I can finally breathe if I take a step outside myself
Maybe I can finally breathe easy
Cut me a box to size, yeah

[Chorus: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
Won't you follow tonight, just breathe in slowly
I don't wanna see you suffer forever, forever
Plagued by thoughts of self-defeat

[Breakdown: JT Cavey]
Ghost of nothing
A ghost of a nothing
An anchor for all suffering

[Bridge: Jesse Cash]
Won't you follow tonight
I don't wanna see you suffer

[Chorus: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
Won't you follow tonight, just breathe in slowly
I don't wanna see you suffer, suffer forever, forever
Won't you follow tonight, just breathe in slowly
I don't wanna see you suffer, suffer forever, forever
I don't wanna see you

[Outro: JT Cavey]
A ghost of a nothing
An anchor for all suffering
