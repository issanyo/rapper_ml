[Intro: Ruck and Rock]
Yo, yo come here man, come over here duke
Get your shit over here man
No, yo stand over here, stand over here
Get the fuck over here man
Place to be, nah duke, come over here this where it's at duke

[Chorus: Ruck and Rock]
Place to be is on my side duke
Cause you don't wanna be the target when I fly the coupe
Nah! Place to be is on my side duke
Cause you don't wanna be the target when I fly the coupe

[Ruck]
Buenos Dias
You know me as
Ruck EL Numero uno
Papi  chulo stickin dicks to yo chick culo
Hard to kill like the White boy Hatcher
Snatch a MC off the rap back, for the simple fact he's wack
So what's the deal?
I feel you can't step to Sean
Wiggin out on bitch ass nigga's since Decepticons (Transform!)
The plan's on but I wish Mary J. Blidge remind me
Take my hoodie off nigga I can't see behind me
Why these guys chose to defy laws
Of the most high most guys get they shit wrapped in gauze
Place to be is on my side
Motherfuck ya pride, lay undercover from big Ruck
If ya monkey ass wanna survive

[Rock]
Yo any set that's hectic it gets worse when Rock's up in it
So somebody tell the fat lady she's up in five minutes
Shit is almost finished right after I take care of witnesses
Roamin the primises not mindin they businesses
Images up in yo melon tellin you to jet
You know if you stay
I might give you some chest pains like cigarretes
Bet ya bottom dollar don't move or swaller
You not promised tommorow but I promise you I'll make ya holler
Pop you coller
Bone stone's the way that I stalk in my zone
You can roam just don't get caught
Place to be is on my side duke
Cause you don't wanna be the target when I fly the coupe
Nigga

[Chorus: Ruck and Rock]
Place to be is on my side duke
Cause you don't wanna be the target when I fly the coupe
Nah! Place to be is on my side duke
Cause you don't wanna be the target when I fly the coupe
Place to be is on my side duke
Cause you don't wanna be the target when I fly the coupe
Nah! Place to be is on my side duke
Cause you don't wanna be the target when I fly the coupe

[Outro: Ruck and Rock]
Yo bitch yo son that nigga jetted son
(Both laughing)
He a bitch nigga
Bitch ass nigga man ooohh shit dude got mad sugar in his tank
Pussy
This is for all y'all people, all y'all people
That still got the little kid in 'em you know
Put a ad in the motherfuckin paper we need
Some true warriors in here

(Chorus fades out)
