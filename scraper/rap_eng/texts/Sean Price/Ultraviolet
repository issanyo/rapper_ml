[Verse 1: Garrison Lee]
This high is all that's left of us
A hallucinogenic conservation that without, I am captious
There is complacency in knowledge and desire in wisdom
They will be found entwined behind, behind the final curtain

[Pre-Chorus: Garrison Lee]
Speak over me
Body, mind, and soul
Lose all self-control

[Verse 2: Garrison Lee]
At once
I'm sinking into desolation, overwhelmed by fascination
This common case I'm bound to face
Amidst this self-induced cerebral recreation

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Speak over me; body, mind, and soul
Bleed into the deep, let go
We must lose all self-control
We must lose all self-control
Let go of letting go and hold on
Let go of letting go and hold on to something whole
Lose all self-control

[Verse 2: Garrison Lee]
The butchering of a beast or birth to enduring peace
Infinite darkness or incessant ease, incessant ease

[Pre-Chorus: Garrison Lee]
Speak over me
Body, mind, and soul
Lose all self-control
Ultraviolet eyes

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Speak over me; body, mind, and soul
Bleed into the deep, let go
We must lose all self-control
We must lose all self-control

[Bridge: Jesse Cash & Garrison Lee]
Let go of letting go, and hold on to something whole
We are not what we seem
A living fiction and hidden theme
Allow the ephemeral ecstasy to course through every vein
This enlightenment is temporary and may never come again

[Outro: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
Ultraviolet eyes
We are not what we seem
A living fiction and hidden theme
Violet hues are comforting
Tracing through my mind, consoling me
Ultraviolet eyes
