[Sean Price]
Alejandro!
Yo, listen
My gun pop, somebody die, nigga
Your gun pop, somebody lied, motherfucker
Niggas sell more, I don't give a fuck
When I see them niggas, them niggas give it up
Respect due, respect given
Peep the chess moves, the best writtens
Bars better than y'all, the barbarian
Bars bitch like, baby shit, get your shit right
You can't fuck with Ruck, you can't fuck with Buck
I get my brother's keeper, please believe he stuck
I have shots sprayed, hit niggas, the gun spit
I am not playing with niggas, not one bit
Gun drawn, I think trouble near me
Kill your seed, Illa Ghee fucking double dared me
Show of deposits, the pay might vary
Go to the closet and pray like Carrie
The power of Price compels you
Fuckin' coward the powder that's white can sell too
Brownsville niggas remembering Ruck
I sold crack for Wayne, made ten off a buck
Swear to God bars, strike me if I'm lyin'
Ain't no fear in Sean' bars, P!
Bag crack in the basement
