[Verse One: Sean Price]
Botswana, Small time little league playa', Pop Warna'
Rock corners with hot blocks thats drug infested
Supply suppliers my money stay thug invested
No disrespect to Duck Down Records (Waddup)
After this go round a nigga lookin' for the exit, Peace!
Sincerely Pyrex Pot Sean, cook it, cut it and spit it on nahright.com
The Vet earner of stripes ta sket burna'
Tears in my eyes when thinking of Hex Murda (what up Hex)
I don't parlay with the crew nigga
I don't Wale and them new niggas
Hardcore rap and Mary J. Blige records
The god gone snap, I'm waving the 5 reckless
Sean Price the best rapper in Brownsville
Don't know me? By the time this song done you clowns will

[Pre Verse Two]
(hurt sumpin, na' mean
Fuck outta here, grown man rap. I'll get my son to fuck one
Of ya'll young rappers up, word to mother.)

[Verse Two: Sean Price]
Ah where was I, Oh yes
Shawn Carter is nice but Sean Price is the best
Sean gone, no Chandon, Sean is a don, I don't wear Sean John
Army suit blackberry brandy is long johns
Matching cheese tims, you separate weed stems
Weed carrier, bulletproof vest tester
Glock'll spray ya just'a left to Rockaway and Chester
Too old to rap to young to whack, 10 fingers, 2 hands my nigga
The guns clap
I don't like niggas no more
8 figure dreams nigga but the figure is 4
These are words from a thousandaire
Selling crack in the P's disguised in some housing gear
I fucked up somewhere down the line, but I got my shit in order
The crown is mine
P!
