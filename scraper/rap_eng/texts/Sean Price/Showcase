[Verse One: Phil Harmonic]
This is a showcase
A forum dedicated to skill and wordplay
Ride along on my born date
I get a little bit older
Rhymes is colder than winds in South Dakota
Flip words like Motorola cellphones, I thought I told ya
Harmonic baby
I got skill to temper your grill
Ripple the still, water that's stagnant
Agitate the current while I'm braggin'
Elevate the level of word play on an album
This is a street banger
Anybody thinkin' it's not
Has got it twisted like necks on coat hangers
Phil is no stranger, to ridin' a beat
I'm a derivative of true lyricist's, never limited
My lyrics is the way that I feel
Amazin'
My vocalizations, got rappers takin' vacation
Maybe permanent, I'm burnin' you all
With the way I word it
Battle? Get murdered, I'll actually be happy to serve you
What?!

[Verse Two: Sean Price]
The Amistad watcher, Glock popper, non rocker
Phantom of the Opera doctor with a chopper
Belligerent bars bitch
All being born to bullshit
Do the knowledge on that while I pull this
[?] wop, west African soup, Idi Amin in Uganda
Magic makin' niggas smoke ganja
Motion, lotion, Ocean 12 caper
I had the bitch now, and then gave her to Brad Pitt later
Listen
If dead rappers get better promotion
You'll probably go diamond when I throw your head in the ocean
Broke rappers want bread but they steadily loafin'
Ask 'em to eat and still can't rap to the beat
Speed knots on your head make niggas bleed burgundy
Until y'all niggas act like you've heard of me, P!
Listen
I beat, earth, wind, fire and ice
Out niggas talkin' slick shit, about Sean Price, nigga

[Verse Three: Phil Harmonic]
First things first
Second and third gon' have to wait till I properly
Rip off the top of the industry mockin' me
It's the beginning
I plan to rhyme until my ending
While lame rappers get folded like store designer linen
Fuck the pretendin'
I'm a nerd sans glasses
Still be spittin' quicker than niggas who rhyme the fastest
Performing with me onstage live?
You might have to take 5 like Jurassic
Right on my demographic
Target I'm blastin'
Knockin' the charts off they axis
The fact is, Harmonic 'bout to get up on the Atlas map
Can see me waving, use a magnifying glasses
I practice, making tactics daily to master
The art form, while I'm formulating the art
It's just a range of thoughts
One at a time, assembly line
Illest with the words spoken (you jokin')
I should play golf because my rhymes got the US Open
