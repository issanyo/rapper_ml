In the days of the woes and ho's
E pills and dro, dykes and bos
A rose, grown from the crack in the steps
I drop jewels pick 'em up, put 'em back on my neck
You slacking at best, overall lack of respect
I clap you in the back of your neck and then back to the rest
Overall you can't match with the best
I die for allah with a flak jacket strapped to my flesh
If you want beef bring it, 'cause beef is fine
Don't come with the pigs, I don't eat no swine
Telling the cops, why the fuck you telling the cops?
I pop you, plus him, go to hell with the cops
Yo
