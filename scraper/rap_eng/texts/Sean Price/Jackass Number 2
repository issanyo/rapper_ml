[Verse 1: Flood]

I set up in Balt'more
Selling the (sniff) off-shore
Niggas is all soft
My AK is so long
I expose y'all
Flood is not the quiet storm
I's with Sean Price
Whipping the Acura on you all
Rappers get all the fun
But street niggas got all the guns
Three and a half for each one, I'm not hummastuntin'
I just play humble frontin'
Funny like the Naked Gun
So when the cops come, they don't even ask me nothin'
Rappers be space buggin'
Never have to face nothin'
So when they say somethin', I be like I don't even hear son
Somebody air son, them niggas like I'm back son
You better appear for 'em
Flood up, a bad one

[Verse 2: Sean Price]

I started in Brownsville where the (gunshot) sounds ill
Whole lot of clowns killed, never like the circus
Started with raw yay', Flocko from Broadway
Got a hotel room, 60 dollars for short stay
Trying to come up, niggas is dumb fucks
Rocking a ninja suit, taking your nunchucks
Soon as the gun buck, niggas like "run Ruck!"
[?]
Slapped with an anvil, give him a advil
Fuck it, it's mad real
P!  ...Motherfucker
