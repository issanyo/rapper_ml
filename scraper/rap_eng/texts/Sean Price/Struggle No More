[Hook]
I see a lot of niggas in front on the TV screen
Hey, they acting like shit is all good
It's a party every night in the industry
But it's a struggle every day in my hood!
Niggas got stressful days
Baby on the way, man ain't buy pills
That's why I drink Hennesy
Take a couple shot and pray the god
Struggle no more, struggle no more!

[Verse 1: Apollo Ali]
This is the real shit for your ears I know you need it
Cause the hood is hard like my car overheated!
Is war going on outside the so just see it
So she is need to form younger so we it
We've been in the recession, there's no secret
The light at the end of the tunnel I don't see it
So thinking of the mass, the plans of prepared
Made a block like the bottom lot and lowkey it
Cause when you broke the gorillas go to bananas
Usual suspect do damage like make man is
When the niggers give mask off they grab hammers
Like fat niggers -
A nigga hungry and I got my eyes on the sandwich
There's no work supervisors can't manage!
Niggers can't eat like they fasting
And that's when the hammer stop blastin and they bring the cash in!

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
And go broke niggas Sean
Hope niggas on
Some bullshit, full clip, full fifty drawn
Son of a bitch, son of an addict
Some god
Clap the thing, piston with you side of chain
Cake up, bitch weight up, check the land
I'm - I'll write you still
Insane in the brain I'm Cypres Hill!
Sean eyes
-
Blind, dawn deaf

The god did him ugly, follow him -
Acknowledge him dummy, Apollo degree, for the AK swallow your face
Bitch nigga!
