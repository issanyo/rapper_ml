[Verse 1: Garrison Lee]
Our hands were holding our fate, but they grew tired
Everything we knew came crashing down in waves of fire, in waves of fire
Strange hands over mouth and in hair
Red eyes from the water, gasping for air, rebirth
Blurred vision disrupts perception of this present state
Made new in the chilling currents that carry me away

[Chorus: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
Follow your heart
And leap from the cliffs, close your divine eyes to reason
Let inertia move you
Cling and be clung to, speak and be spoken to
How beautiful you find yourself
Remove this scourge from where we dwell
You will be found in a dark place
And somewhere through time and space

[Verse 2: Garrison Lee]
Adorned with purity yet blessed with knowledge
Contradicting what I've been taught
Upheld in a pale light that burns my skin
I am the distorted one, I am the distorted one
I am a prisoner in this body, bound and chained to flesh
I am the distorted one, I am a prisoner in this body
A mirror reflecting an honest rendition
A faction following a faithless tradition
Your own body renamed religion, rebirth
Our hands were holding our fate, but they grew tired
And everything we knew came crashing down

[Bridge: Jesse Cash]
You will be found in a dark place
And somewhere, somewhere through time and space
A mirror reflecting an honest rendition
A faction following faithless tradition

[Chorus: Garrison Lee & Jesse Cash]
Follow your heart
And leap from the cliffs, close your divine eyes to reason
Let inertia move you
Cling and be clung to, speak and be spoken to
How beautiful you find yourself
Remove this scourge from where we dwell
You will be found in a dark place
And somewhere through, through time and space

[Outro: Garrison Lee]
I am the distorted one
I am a prisoner in this body, bound and chained to flesh
Rebirth
