[Intro: Jesse Cash]
It comes to fracture vested trust
A love to shatter and turn to rust
I drag my name through waves to wade black water
Wallow and drown

[Verse 1: JT Cavey]
A new shade of gray disorients the portrait
Repetitive contusions concuss the allure
Cataract eyes and cloudy minds interrupt a perfect design

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Crashing waves come to swallow us
Wallow and drown in it
Shadows wait to devour us
It hurts to surrender

[Verse 2: JT Cavey]
Presentation is everything when you created the play
The audience hypnotized by the imagery
In this vicious cycle of disbelief
That the visionless cannot conceive
You can drag me down six feet deep
So I can fight for a life that I threw away
In this moment of resurgence
Clear the dissonance and recover me

[Interlude: Jesse Cash]
Fears suppressed exploit our lust
And our memories turn to rust

[Verse 3: JT Cavey]
And when we reach that point, barren of things to say
There's nothing left to save, do not resuscitate
Swallow your pride, hide what you feel inside
There are some things that can not be rectified

[Chorus: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
Crashing waves come to swallow us
Wallow and drown in it
Shadows wait to devour us
It hurts to surrender
Leeches lie in wait, but you're blind to it, but you're blind to it
A void that you create, you give life to it
It hurts to surrender

[Bridge: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
It comes to fracture vested trust
A love to shatter and turn to rust
If words could carry my pain through the busy streets and empty alleyways
Be the one who hears my cry like the moon who craves the night

[Outro: JT Cavey]
You can drag me down six feet deep
So I can fight for a life that I threw away
In this moment of resurgence
Clear the dissonance and recover me
