[Intro: Sean Price]
Yeah, Nez, A-Rob what up?
West Virginia, VA
A-yo

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Sean Price for pres and Nez the vice
I play cee-lo with razor blade, slice and dice
I'll Mike Tyson your moms and Riddick Bowe your ho'
And Fl√©x Trinidad your dad to get dough
Money making, honey's shaking
Fuck it, better tip it though
Ruck is a square who fell in love with a stripper ho
Pick a flow, kick a flow, any kind of flow
If you want a fucking feature that's a pretty penny yo
Listen, A-Rob on his job, he got bitches and guns
So when I come to West Virginia it's fun
A dime of the buddha they lying to Judah
I smack the beat, wake her up and act like I'm the producer
Sean Price, I don't rap like I used to, I'm much better
So it shouldn't be a question on whether I touch cheddar
The God bust Berratas but a hole in your hat
Jesus Price, sole controller of rap
Motherfucker

[Hook]
So what's the deal cousin, it don't matter at all
Man, we'll try to settle this before we'll actually brawl
Do what's the deal cousin, that's how we laugh at these frauds
Who are those fake motherfuckers who be yapping their jaws
So what's the deal cousin, it don't matter at all
Man, we'll try to settle this before we'll actually brawl
Do what's the deal cousin, that's how we laugh at these frauds
Who are those fake motherfuckers who be yapping their jaws

[Verse 2: Nezquic]
Feel the crossfire, now battle the boss sire
Far side, from the land of the lost, the cold rhymer
Chart climber, heart sniper, raw writer like Rob Reiner
Resolve frauds 'til they thoughts engulfed with alzheimer's
Flaunt diamonds of all sizes in dreams I'm so excited
Wake up feel disappointment, it seems I'm suicidal
Injected with hepatitis, inspected when step in cyphers
My section, we rep the nicest, outrages like record prices
Debate about weapon sizes, cut face with some razor wire
Escape from insane asylums, seems I'm the forsaken child
I scrapped up my savings while, I brace up and made the plow
Blazing haze up in the basement white owls and puffing clouds
Fuck haters that hate us, now ain't nobody safe and sound
Making payments on my [?] and my [?] tapping thou
Smacking, snatching crowns, 'cause rappers is backing down
Ask around, Nez is the best without a doubt

[Hook]
So what's the deal cousin, it don't matter at all
Man, we'll try to settle this before we'll actually brawl
Do what's the deal cousin, that's how we laugh at these frauds
Who are those fake motherfuckers who be yapping their jaws
So what's the deal cousin, it don't matter at all
Man, we'll try to settle this before we'll actually brawl
Do what's the deal cousin, that's how we laugh at these frauds
Who are those fake motherfuckers who be yapping their jaws

[Verse 3: A-Rob]
So what's the deal cousin, I heard these haters that plot
The ultimatum to this equation is greater the odds
But stay on your job, either you're able or not
Disabled to make pay role if you pay on the spot
It's fatal when you're in danger, ain't no place you can stop
That anger take all the pain away, basically drop
Shit's major, when you don't wake up you late on the clock
Send angels from every angle with halos on top
I'm not afraid of [?] for me, I say this a lot
Truth is the only way to reveal if you facing the cops
No change up in locks, you trapped and now you waiting for help
'Cause ain't nobody gonna help you if you think for yourself
Relate what I dealt, through family and trials and tribulations
For a while I been embracing, more than [?] when it changes
Born a child in infant ages
Going through these different stages
Now a days I get impatient, found a way to diss in flagrant
