[Sean Price]
Yo, news from the East, sire
The beast's back and everyone of his raps that he speaks fire
Demolish a corn-ball ass rapper and smack him 'til Knowledge is Born
Peace to the Gods and Peace to the Earths
My piece put your ass in pieces, put your piece in the dirt
God Sean hands-on, I sandpalm niggas
Beat you bitch bloody, here's a tampon, nigga
Rapper Sean, truth spitter
You do decathalons with Bruce Jenner, you bitch
The apparel is tally-ho
The God Donkey Sean throws barrels at Mario
King rap in the Phantom
Jump out the back singing National Black Anthems
P!

[Illa Ghee]
Man, I put a bullet in your sweatglands
Yankee not a Mets fan
Punch you in your headband
Illa the original killer of the bars
Kill the fraud scars in interviews
And get on your interlude
Honorary chemical, monetizing metaphor
I'm Malcolm X's funeral, bastard but I'm beautiful
Hashtag Illa got it man, you's a fag bag
Probably dress in drag, street stabbin' at your swag
I'm an atheist but I know I'm God myself
Cut the shadiest, radiator bars I melt
So melodic, 50,000 devils in the preacher's pocket
See I beef and broc' it, words a sexy object
Be the prophet, I'm a murder in the projects
Gorilla mist, flick of the wrist, showin' the watches
Don't even bother, I'm better than both Carters
This is Sparta, I'm pushing your wig like bad barbers
