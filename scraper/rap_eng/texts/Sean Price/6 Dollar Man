[Intro: G-Tang, (Sean Price)]
Okay people we're recording live
(Headphones up in booth one?)
Roger
(Microphone on?)
That's affirmative, we're recording live
(Turn my headphones up a bit will you?)
Roger that Sean
(Awesome)
Sounding good P!
(Voice is clear, it comes to rhyme, record the track, say it on me)
We've got an emergency, Sean's album is flopping
(I've got a memory lapse, I can't remember my lines, my album sales are slipping and in the street feedback is negative, I'm ready to quit)
Get your pitch back in tune, stay focused
(I can't hold on much longer, I'm breaking up, I'm loosing connection, I'm losing money, them royalty checks are shitty, Ahhh!)
Sean Price, the brokest rapper, career barely alive
We can rebuild him, we have the production
We can make him stronger than rock
More skillful than before
Better, wittier, crazier wordplay than before
We can rebuild him

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Yo, listen
Updated, upgraded
Don't get mad motherfucker just say Ruck made it, say it
P! That's crowd participation
So now the situation's wild so peep the shit you facing
How you want it par two in your hat?
Or the Barry Bond BALCO armed with aluminum bats
Through with you cats, acting like you tougher than I
Motherfuckers getting snuffed in the eye, no lie
I bullshit you not, pull quick and pop
Full clip and drop the new kid on the block
Body your frame, Nigga P-Body's the name
Got me a car, but the shit is not in my name
P!
