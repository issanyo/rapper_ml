[Sean Price]

Yo...
Yeah...

Earth shattering first to burst battering
Wrong color on your turf trafficking

What up?

Sean's the name y'all niggas ain't ready for
More beef in the street and none in my metaphors

Sean the bomb Lebanon Decepticon
Most high, most fly, bow tie like Farrakhan

All praise due to allah
After I did what I do to your squad

Listen

Your face look like steak with the A1 sauce
When the guard let the AR off

Bang! Listen

Ain't a rapper that will battle on smack
I'm the rapper with the gat on your hat

Nigga

Rap prime minister
I'm when I finish ya
Forward forward high punch bitch
Fatally finish ya

Y'all niggas is wack
Sean Price and I'm brining it back

Yo, I'm almost famous
Y'all niggas is half ass
Almost anus
Got a new car
Almost ranged it
With broke bond and chain
Almost exchanged it

I hang with
Niggas that's two time felons
First of the month on the stoop be dime selling

Sean Price is dumb
Sell crack from the block where Mic Tyson from

Listen

I like fighting but I'm nice with guns
I might knife him but I like my gun

Unleash me paw
Daddy the dog
With my eyes on the green nigga
Kermit the Frog

Stupid with mine
My stupidest lines
I put them together
Turn them to a beautiful rhyme

When I rap
Y'all niggas take notice
When you rap
Niggas notice you bogus you focus on me
Sean Price brokest MC
Heroine addict literally the dopest MC

Yo, I'm telling the truth
You living a lie
When I step in the booth
All competitors die
My sweater is fly
Look at my kicks
Look at my jeans
Look at that shit
I'm crooked as shit
I sell crack in the building
Domestic violence start wilin' smacking my children

Ruck is the realest, realla
Bare the name in red monkey
I'm a fucking gorilla

Donkey Kong is the game
Donkey Sean is the name
I'm playing for keeps
I'm pawning your chain

Yeah! Hahaha...
