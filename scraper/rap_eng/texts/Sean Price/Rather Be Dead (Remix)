[Hosts Commentary: Vents]
Ah yeah! Again and again. This one's a "Rather Be Dead" remix by my man, Sesta! From the Funk—the Funk—the Funk—the Funk—the Funkoars clique, buddy

[Commentary: Sean Price]
It's Sean Price [?] the Golden Era mixtapes. You know what I'm sayin'? Get involved baby. It's the God, P-Body

[Verse 1: Sesta]
I can't land it then abandon it, fuck, we had an accident
I check my pants, I think we crashed into a laxative
They thought that Kyle Sandilands was in the ambulance
I think 'cause of my brain damage and they smell shit
I get [?] to get retarded, well pardon
You were even there before you even started
I fuck 'em bad see, can't understand me
The Oars is every show promoters plan B
The venom [?] are now my [?]
You wanna get high with irony, smoke trees with Greenpeace
I'm rappin' Diesel on you fuckin' hybrids
'Your highness' is what you call me from how red my eyes is
Well I'm the rappers rapper, yeah the might fapper
You're frightened, you hide in cubicles [?] toilet [?]
It's very awkward once you get the visit [?] by me
It's like your first date after catching HIV

[Hook: Briggs]
So what's that sound!? (Click, clack, blaow)
[?] my man, Setty X (How you like me now?)
None better than, tell me who else to offend?
And we do it till they'd (Rather be dead)
So what's that sound!? (Click, clack, blaow)

None better than, tell me who else to offend?
And we do it till they'd (Rather be dead)

[Verse 2: Sesta]
Next to us you sound bagpipes: Trash
Hidden all up in your cavity: Ass (Yes)
Now that I'm controllin' the plane, well as it happens
You should know I'm comfortable around rats and other scavengers
I got you rappers all pickin' through damages
Lookin' for a little something you can use for yourself
Well listen, straight garage, rappers all harmless
Looking too cute with your sponsorship garments
Fuck you and your brand new shoes, mane
Clean white shirt, turn around, see the poo stain
Two faces, both of 'em equally
As weak as the other one, clean breakin' the food chain
[?] the Beautane
Your girl's had too many members, I call her Wu-Tang
I talk about you while you're still in the room
Shit, your mother probably drank while you were still in the womb
So fuck you
