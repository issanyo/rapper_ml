[Verse 1: JT Cavey]
Terror creeps like a hurricane
Oppressing the seas, trying to sink my vessel
Powerless to the crippling wake
Pull me in and destroy my faith
With my liquid lungs, I can breathe

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Free of broken memories that keep holding on
Contemplating love you spent only to feel alone
I feel alone
Love you spent only to feel alone
Still holding on

[Verse 2: JT Cavey]
A hollow heart holds no peace
Can we forgive and forget, receive and protect
When we carry our prisons in our heads?
Carve my legacy into the stone
For my light can only burn so long
But before I go, my brimstone bones
Will smolder all my fears of the unknown

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Free of broken memories that keep holding on
Contemplating love you spent only to feel alone
I feel alone
Love you spent only to feel alone
And no strength to let it go

[Post-Chorus: JT Cavey]
In my wishing well, where all my words turn to stone
Speak to me through grit teeth; a broken soul
And a heart that wants to take control

[Bridge: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey]
Who's to say whether we should drift?
I can feel you slipping away

[Verse 3: Jesse Cash]
Shadows unfamiliar to me
Dance around the walls of the most familiar places
Now I've become a stranger in my own home
I'd fall asleep with you next to me, now every day I wake alone

[Breakdown: JT Cavey]
Shadows of strangers compose themselves reluctantly
How can you confront your fears when they stand back to back?
Trust in a disconnect to make the pieces fit, oh
Shadows of strangers
Shadows of strangers

[Outro: Jesse Cash]
Hope you left behind
Home is undefined
Hope you left behind
Home is undefined
