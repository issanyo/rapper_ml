We going OT and back

Gotta bring my strap
Going OT and back
If niggas try to rat on me
Man you know I'm coming back
Make a bitch bring a pack
Break it down in the trap
Niggas saying that we lack
Do you know where we at?
I'm from the SouthSide
Where the other side niggas get whacked
Told my nigga lean back
Ima hit him in the back
Ima put him in a pack
You know shit don't last
But I gotta save cash

Dirty money, bloody hands

I never switch on my mans
If you fuck with my plans

Going OT and back
In and out of the trap
Fronts, I don't do that
Just made 30 stacks
Whatchu know about that?
Pockets stay looking fat
50 shots in the Mac
So how the fuck can we lack?
You can find me in the back
And my hittas stay strapped
So disrespect, you get clapped
Put the burner in the stash
No gloves, no mask
Drive off while we laugh
Doing hits on the man
Free Fredo out the can
And this .40 won't jam
Leave him holy, no plans
Leave him holy, no plans
And I do this for my fans
They don't understand
Bitch tryna shake my hand
You gotta fuck my mans bitch
You gotta fuck my mans
