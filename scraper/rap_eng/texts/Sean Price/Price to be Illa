I lay you down like a soldier on a foreign ground
Spit alien … lyrics got the foreign nouns
Keep the pound for the funny style pound
… lose ya mind fuck around and get found clown
I’m in the lounge chilling, wit like four women
I’m a gym empire putting fire to your entire sound
Say something
The new millennium phil drummond …
My mind in a Bed Stuy dungeon …
My lines sitting high in the blue hummer stuntin’
Amused by the lames function
This is nothing I abuse beats, I refuse to sleep
I … drugs in my rap style meet like it’s drugs in the street
Young gunner like chris and neef, the black Cesar, the first raw rap to be cut with banita…
I did it so will fit through your speaker
Sell it by the liter, I thought i just spit a little ether

Ladies and gentlemen, haters and bitter friends
You listenin’ to the hard core Brooklyn
Go hard when the war left…
Hand gun lifting, straight menacing
Ladies and gentlemen, haters and bitter friends
You listenin’ to the hard core Brooklyn
Going hard when the war left …
Hand gun lifting, straight menacing

Yo, I don’t give a fuck about your name, your crew or your block spot
Your track record, your rap record, who the god shot
Fuck ya new kicks, fuck ya new whips, fuck ya sheep skin
Fuck ya deuce flicks (bitch) …
I ain’t with all this dress shit
Your bitch fat and knocked kneed, lookin’ like Precious
She a rider… give me the sket... one shot
Ya face look like Forest Whitaker neck
You want a verse just give me the check
Just let me go first - you got the worse verse on the set
I don’t like rappers, I don’t like producers
I fuck with drug dealers and drug abusers
Ice cold nigga, rock hard looser
Sean Price - I am Buckshot´s shooter
Shut the fuck up
No afro, no electric socks, I´m Off The Wall with the sket that pop, pop, motherfucker, Brooklyn…

Ladies and gentlemen, haters and bitter friends
You listenin’ to the hard core Brooklyn
Go hard when the war left…
Hand gun lifting, straight menacing
Ladies and gentlemen, haters and bitter friends
You listenin’ to the hard core Brooklyn
Going hard when the war left …
Hand gun lifting, straight menacing

… see I win like Kobe or Khalid been bout it… fly on the million I never would need a stylist …
Me, illa the kid but I never act childish
Reroute ya gangster, clowns is getting outted
I used to hug the block like an auntie
Keeping the hammer upon me, wearing army fatigues
And my blow like a palm tree breeze
I breeze off in a drop "s" 2 plus 3 a blow trees like a hurricane
Keep 2 hoes like hue hef
Can’t hear, I’m Jermaine Dupri
I’m so def, I’m a drug and the child of the ghetto like g dep…
I’m an animal, … lyrical wolf that eats flesh
Then I punch you in the face like a box do …
Stepping over all obstacles
Inject rap with a rocket fuel…
Use hole in a penny …illa ghee control and my flow is a Bentley

Ladies and gentlemen, haters and bitter friends
You listenin’ to the hard core Brooklyn
Go hard when the war left…
Hand gun lifting, straight menacing
Ladies and gentlemen, haters and bitter friends
You listenin’ to the hard core Brooklyn
Going hard when the war left …
Hand gun lifting, straight menacing
