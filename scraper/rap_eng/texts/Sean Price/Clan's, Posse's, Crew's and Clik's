[Rock: Intro]
A-yo son
A-yo come downstairs, son
There's like six bitch-ass niggas on the corner, son
These niggas is rapping, kicking raps and shit
Can't tell these niggas they ain't hype
They punk smooth bullshit
Just meet me downstairs, son, I'mma set it on these niggas, son
These niggas have no idea, son
Check it, check it

[Verse 1: Rock]
And one time for your mind, one time for the snitch dropping dime
Me nah wanna hear you whine when my nine's to your spine
Climb this, Rocky, Mountain
Energy's from my fountain of youth running through my brain pounding
So don't be found in my clutches
If you don't who Sparsky is, then you don't know who Dutch is
Don't get snuffed kid, we cause ruckus
And rock mad domes while we at it
Who's the first up to see blackness like the universe?

[Verse 2: Ruck]
Fuck that, niggas better start running for shelter
Live and direct from the 9 'til next that nigga from Heltah Skeltah
Word em up I murder ducks who never heard of Ruck
Plus my mind ills on rhyme skills with the nine that I buck
Girls demand me, mad bitches I slam the
Microphone you hand me till the judge remand me
Can we, get along like Rodney, and Rock please
Put these niggas in they proper place cause you cocky

[Verse 3: Rock]
I, be the drama bringer wringer of a niggas neck
Wrecker of a set I buck shots with a steel Tec, wussy
Where's all them suckers talking trash 'bout they RnR-in'
(They heard us coming and turned to track stars, check it)
I be, never sloppy, I be Rock, see
I rock heads from Bedrock to Yugoslavia
Robbing you and your crew blind, yeah we do crimes
Find that ass a new spine, or a new behind
Now you whine, but yo stop the bloodclot crying
Like Screwface, I in the mood to bash your eyes in
Devils does know who I am, madman from Heltah Skeltah
Mr. Flipster, Rock, Grandson of Sam

[Verse 4: Ruck]
As the world turns in my search for tomorrow
I seek the guiding light, for some insight
Freaky like a golden shower when my golden bowels
Hit instrumentals get influential like Colin Powell, now
Fuck the world, stick my dick in the dirt
Pull tools on fools who claim I ain't cool like Levert
Expert when I network my lyrics like a rebel
Vexed cause the devil never take me to that next level
It's never humble in asphalt jungles
When you sling rocks to Ricans and bag dough in bundles
Some may wonder, the evil these two men do
Torment you, lyrical landlord, your fucking rent due

[Hook]
Clans, posses, crews and cliks
All y'all bitch niggas can suck my dick
Cliks, posses, crews and clans
Can't none of y'all niggas fuck with me and my man

[Verse 5: Rock]
A-yo one's for the, shots I pop
Two's for the anti-real snakes I fought and dropped
Three's for the irrational Ruck, bitch!
I be Rock and the four's for Hip Hop cause with this shit we rip shop
Ask me how foul I am
Man you know damn well it was me that hit your bitch up in my man's van
Suplex your grand-pops then like corn I pop shit
You can't flush, fucking with us get smacked with hock spit
Who dare square with Rock me I break you
Three times worse than a bumboclot earthquake do
Heltah Skeltah is hectic hit the deck then step
If you wanna hear your neck click
See this center, don't really play no basketball
I do my shooting with a motherfucking Magnum 4
To the floor, OGC hit up everything that come through the door
Recognize Heltah Skeltah means war

[Verse 6: Ruck]
So what's the reason for the treason, punk you wanna die
My mind crucify those who try to defy
God Cipher Divine drop bombs on the blind
In the mood to get rude with the lyrics instead of my nine
Now I want a nigga to come with hand skills
Man chill, might end up in a landfill
Stand still, nigga you know the position
Glocks clicking from niggas who ain't got pots to piss in
Plus I get hyped when my mic strikes windpipes
Me and Rock is this tight
(There'll never be no fist fights)
Your lip punks when my fifth smokes the rich folks who sniff coke
Now your bitch broke ain't no misquote
I just spoke, wicked ways with words of wisdom
Like Cyclops I spot fly shots with ill vision
Similar to none, son so it fucking seem
Savages get sewn the fuck up with shots to they spleen

[Hook]
Clans, posses, crews and cliks
All y'all bitch niggas can suck my dick
Cliks, posses, crews and clans
Can't none of y'all niggas fuck with me and my man
Clans, posses, crews and cliks
All y'all bitch niggas can suck my dick
Cliks, posses, crews and clans
Can't none of y'all niggas fuck with me and my man
Clans, posses, crews and cliks
All y'all bitch niggas can suck my dick
Cliks, posses, crews and clans
Can't none of y'all niggas fuck with me and my man
Clans, posses, crews and cliks
All y'all bitch niggas can suck my dick
Cliks, posses, crews and clans
Can't none of y'all niggas fuck with me and my man

[Outro: Ruck]
Heltah Skeltah
So get your clans, posses, crews and cliks
All y'all bitch niggas can suck my dick
Cliks, posses, crews and clans
Can't none of y'all niggas fuck with me and my man
Clans, posses, crews and cliks
All y'all bitch niggas can suck on the big Ruck dick
All y'all niggas, eat a dick, word up
And if you wear motherfucking fatigues and sneakers
Pussy, I'm bringing it to you
Heltah Skeltah
Motherfucker
Nocturnal, nocturnal
I'll bet you a buck fifty you can't fuck with me
