[Verse 1]
Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim
Back to the block, I pop squads, air your team
Hip-hop gwap shit, I'm still grabbing pennies
Rap game got me mad, Deric Angelettie
New school niggas wack, you seen the vet starting
Got a few left in me nigga I'm Brett Farvin'
Niggas sorta rap, and they sing songs
I'm guerrilla rap, call me King Kong
Rap soldiers, Special Forces, Navy Seal
Conquer the rap game without a major deal
Living the fast life speeding on the autobahn
Slow the car down the car seat contain my daughter Sean
Sean major knife, Sean slay ya
Revoke your ghetto pass stupid nigga, John Mayer
Coke in the car and heat in my lap
Motherfucker this is deeper than rap
Motherfucker
Shut the fuck up

[Hook]
Shut the fuck up nigga, yeah
Talking all that bullshit nigga
What up P?

[Verse 2]
Firecracker, rap with a short fuse
Back smack a rapper for rapping with auto-tunes
Fucking rapping computer thug
Stick the hard drive in your ass, computer love
Name your top 5 rappers
I'll smack shit out of them, they not live rappers
Back-pack rappers, fuck all the bullshit
Open the back-pack with a gat and a full clip
Every verse is kinda raw, old man rapping you can't fuck with a dinosaur
I'm a Jurassic bastard, haphazardly clap at your faculty tragic
Magic, David Blaine, make rappers disappear when I change the game, P!
M-I-C Tyson, assault and battery charge when the God seen writing
Motherfucker
