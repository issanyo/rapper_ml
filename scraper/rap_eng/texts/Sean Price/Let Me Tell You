[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Uh, uh
You see P you know that the Four's Kept
By my side you scared to leave from your doorstep
Embrace ya Satan my niggas endorse that
Heat your face fixed up scalpel and forceps
Sean Rambo, look at my war chest
Hamburger hill bullets peelin off raw flesh
G.I. Joe ass niggas, can't see my flow ass niggas
Listen, I got a bullet(bullet) for every bump on your face kid
I keyloid ya neck without doin' a state bid
Concrete jungle that's where the ape live
Young niggas is wack, the reason I hate kids
Young girls is sluts, they older they stay slits
Fat out of shape in the shelter with 8 kids
Fucking welfare check bitches, hell yeah i deck bitches
Chris Brown

Hey
Hey

[Verse 2: Sean Price]

Niggas, think I'm washed up
No video, no radio
So you thinking that my squad suck
That's outrageous, passport stamped out I needed extra pages
Rappers wanna battle smack blood out your face, rappers wanna tattle
Hard denim Levi's Rugby is Polo
My youngstas hard body, I dress like bozo
Almost ashamed to say that I rap
Not because of the age, it's just the game is so wack
Grown man spittin' some wild shit
Y'all smoke home grown, home alone on some child shit
Young niggas ain't understanding the god
Well grow up a little and understand in God
Newborns learn ya lesson
Before ya face to face with the black Smif-n-Wessun, P!

[Hook]
