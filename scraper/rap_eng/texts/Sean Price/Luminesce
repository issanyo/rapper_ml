[Verse 1: Jesse Cash & J.T. Cavey]
I'm spiraling out of control, so you illuminate a clean slate
You're lifting the weight that's diluting inspiration
I woke with the sun in my face, mountains by my side
The desert air pulling the breath from my lungs
I've been making my way through a barren landscape
Littered with remains of past lives and shadows of the scavengers

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
World passing by, leaving traces of shapes, blurring into memory
Dreaming of terrain that sustains, I wake up

[Post-Chorus: J.T. Cavey]
I'm lying parallel with the landscape

[Verse 2: Jesse Cash & J.T. Cavey]
There will always be a void to be filled, illuminate a clean slate
Keep lifting the weight that is diluting inspiration
There will always be a void with no permanent fix
Shifting of puzzle pieces to simulate a whole

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
World passing by, leaving traces of shapes, blurring into memory
Dreaming of terrain that sustains, I wake up to a world that's unfamiliar
We leave and then we go back like we never left home
We go back like we never left home

[Bridge: Jesse Cash & J.T. Cavey]
When will we wake the fuck up?
Parallel with the landscape, I lie awake
With diminishing desire to always seek escape
From a home where I feel sound and safe

[Chorus: Jesse Cash & J.T. Cavey]
World passing by, leaving traces of shapes, blurring into memory
Dreaming of terrain that sustains, I wake up, wake up
When will we all wake up?
Diminished desire to always seek escape to a world that's unfamiliar
We leave and then we go back like we never left home
We go back like we never left
