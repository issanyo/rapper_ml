[Verse 1:Slaine]
I was sort of sicko I'm psycho slightly insane
Stick a nickle bag writing I'm >pipe lightning the flames???<
Ditch a motherfucking  cab steal a bike in the rain
Wipe it out on the train tracks I ain't right in my brain
Put the skull on the >schoolie??<
Put the bully in boulevard
Smoke koolies with Julie
Suck me off till I'm fully high
Blow a load and wipe it off then give it to Jenny
She can suck it soft for me, bust a nut with the semi
Any occasion
I'm staying  for days and the >days in??<
Cocaine and liqour and a bunch of caucasians
Women who want food stamps and raising
Children in project buildings they know my rhymes it's amazing
The white trash King of the corner;  the block bastard
Your fucking hasbeen , you been dead you got blasted
I'm still alive I'm making history built
Like these bitches in the media
They pissed at me still
I blacked out a couple years and ended up in the >flash/flask???<
I ain't catch a case  I bought that new kicks and whips
Got two bank accounts and them shits is fat
Now i'm the mouse with the cheese, cause i tricked the trap

[Verse 2:Blacastan]
I'm in the tub stroking bitches like Fritz the Cat
Then a bitch busted and tried to >frisk me black??<
Like MCs is jumping outta shoes and socks
Crobars >up??< the blocks giving niggas >speednox??<
Now you're bleeding leaking on your new outfit
Bragging 'bout your new kicks that ain't come out yet
You're just a fraud frying up >swine and ???<









[Verse 3:Sean Price]
The earth maker the earth quaker
The Doctor killed patient is urging the nurse pager
My 5th fire fist motherfucker the 1st blazer
Asianic black man a fan of Fantasia
