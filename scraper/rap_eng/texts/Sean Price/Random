[Sean Price]
As-salamu alaykum
It's the rap Jack Tatum
I break backs on rap cats who fabricatin'
You're just a worker, why's your boss hatin'?
Talkin' bullshit, get lost in translation
Nerds makin' the game lame, you birds fakin'
I will smack your fuckin' head off, verbatim
Line for line, rhyme for rhyme
I will end your fuckin' career with this 9 of mine
All my life I've been quick with the drama
I'm at peace now ever since a nigga took his Shahada
So ?, my raps is so groovy
Bald head and big beard, I'm so Sunni
50 emcees, put 'em in a line
Get 50 more thugs with they hand on a 9
It'll take 50 more before I go for mine
Buck 50 cross the face for niggas thinkin' they rhyme
It's nothin' to end your life
PF, Tone Toca and Kimbo Price!
P!

[Tony Touch]
Yeah man that's what I'm talking about
50 emcees, homeboy
Yo, Guilt!
Whatup tho!

[Guilty Simpson]
Peace to Tony Toca
Landlord record heat and then I put it out
Like the only smoker
Disrespect, I'll fold your soldiers (Simpson)
I got it made like I'm bonin' Oprah
I got your number, fuck a Motorola
I buck a loaded toaster, burn bread
And turn heads to coma dosers
Comatose, you'll sleep well
I'm conniving like my dog in D12
I'm surviving, obese style like beats well
Me fail? Never
Let your face wrinkle up
Pop you then come back and wet the same spot up
Like sprinklers (Damn!)
You want war? Don't think of us
Soon as you do, we shoot at your crew
Then it's back at my spot with a beautiful view
This is livin' for me but music for you (coward)
Simpson writes flagrant statements
Heater on my waist still scrapes the pavement
Assault rifle like a limo truck
I don't A&R, put your demos up
And get me the cash flow
I Muay Thai rappers and call 'em collabos
Catch a knee to the face
You can sleep in a lake
Or hand over the keys to the safe
