Nowadays you got these little niggas gettin' murked for throwin' up signs
By the modern day Zodiac killers holdin' on nines
See clowns and I get pumped up like Dee Brown
Catch a beatdown like Barkley comin' down off a rebound
Bring the havoc, killers make you feel the static
Illmatic ratchets, even iller with the automatics
Cause while these niggas laid back and I display facts
Callin' wack emcees Pat cause they don't say jack/Sajak
Payback for the gay rap, tight pants and scarves on they necks like golden women at the racetrack
Smack they mixtapes wayback cause what they say's wack
Toss it in the attic, throw it on top of the 8 track
Funny when a dummy really wanna pull a card
Till I icepick their ice grill, thinkin' that they hard
And if anybody really wanna know the God
Thirty rhymes a day, a thousand push ups like I'm on the yard

City kid, Sugarhill Gang, dollar bill y'all
Merciless mic skills, I pop a lotta pills, pa
Predicate felon, just got off parole
Gun etiquette, sket'll clap, just got off the phone
Shot caller, I call shots, y'all call cops
I make another call, the cop get dropped
Stop playin', you heard me nigga, Monkey Barz
Shots sprayin', (BONG! BONG!) keep it funky, pa
Nigga my right hand tattoo kids
And my wife'll shoot a bitch in a minute like Papoose' wiz
You see the motherfucking team I lead
I'm a boss, Sean P, call me Kareem Said
Beat battering beast, East African Chief
I smoke weed when it's wrapped in a leaf
Broker than me, niggas ain't broker than P
Pockets full of lint balls, fuck you hopin' to see?
P!

Grab the piece to paint a masterpiece
In the street you obsolete
Coppin' keys? Nigga please
You either copy me or cop a plea
Couldn't possibly stand a chance
The battle stance far too advanced
We the champs, money
Livin' lovely, I'm the major, you the understudy
Funny, claim you hungry but niggas ain't want nothin' from me
The last man standin', demandin'
The microphone hand in, flow beyond your understanding
Banging for a new era to shatter
Jumpin' out the Jeeps ?
Sportin' terror who ??
Fuck the chitter chatter, pitter patter
Niggas quick to scatter like a ripple factor
Cause they know we out to rip a rapper
After us, second to none
Too many bums claim the East back, take it from us
Never shine like the Sun but I'm callin' you one
Pose with guns and claimin' thug but gettin' robbed for your funds
One
