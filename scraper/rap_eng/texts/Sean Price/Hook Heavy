[Sean Price verse]
Alejandro!!!!
Spit it more scary, B
Nigga tour, getting more Liberatore calories
The likeable unlikely to fight me
Sight-seeing, wife-beating, meeting politely (Huh?)
I might be the best there is at
This shit here. Stand clear from weird cats
Get money: we need checks, Sean
Master my art, gun bar DMX song *POP* (Uh!)
Shot by the Wesson!
Rock grimy: I'm not on Hot 97
Rosenberg play me at late night
I'm too old to be up late to listen to late night (That's right!)
State to state, great, relate with real dudes
Some of them nerds who got the urge to kill you (Uh!)
(P!) A true chief caper
Play the beat. Need a pen and loose-leaf paper
