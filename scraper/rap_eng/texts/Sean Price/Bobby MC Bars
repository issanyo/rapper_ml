[Verse 1: Sean Price]
? the shot burn couples
Jim Snuka from top turn buckles
All of ya'll bitch, go against the warrior prince
Walkin on rose petal, metal, the four to the fifth
P
Battle off bars
Blastin off
Dashin off in a Hasselhoff car
Mind over matter, the fuck the matter with ya'll?
Divine rhyme pattern, and Ruck is badder than ya'll
Seen near, spittin new shit, infectious lines
Clean your ear with a Q-tip and Check the Rhime
Sean from a tribe called Shabazz
It's on sight, I might leave a knife in yo ass
Truly back search how come?
Sean's so nice, Kool G Rap's first album
Shit I spit is facts
Exquiste with the raps
But I feel that I'm slipping through the cracks
P!

[Hook: Ike Eyes]
Slipping through the cracks, dipping through the trap
Just trying to finish my pack
Soon as I get done, I'm gone get one
I'm gone get some
That's my shit son
Slipping through the cracks, dipping through the trap
Just trying to finish my pack
Soon as I get done, I'm gone get one
I'm gone get some
That's my shit son

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Listen, I'm out dazed the hammer
Deuce deuce when Bruce is outraged and angered
Cops got the photo, on the low though, he's a bitch
Pop a shot in the stomach, "Manolo shoot the piece of shit"
Pad, the hotel, cocaine, who is he
Schoolly D music, this shit a movie to me
Distributing the packs, gripping on the mac
And I'm slipping through the cracks
You got fat, while I starve
Sket drawn, It's on this the ballad from Marv
Kidnap a kid, if you think I ain't bout that
Mail you the major digit, extra finger to count that
P!

[Hook: Ike Eyes]
Slipping through the cracks, dipping through the trap
Just trying to finish my pack
Soon as I get done, I'm gone get one
I'm gone get some
That's my shit son
Slipping through the cracks, dipping through the trap
Just trying to finish my pack
Soon as I get done, I'm gone get one
I'm gone get some
That's my shit son
