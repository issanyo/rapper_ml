[Verse 1]
All that shootin', nobody got shot
All that lootin', nobody got guap
Nigga with the A, nigga with the E-R
Fuck how you sayin', I spray at you in the ER
I used to be nice to rappers
No more Mr. Nice Guy, I don't like these rappers
Hate dummies spittin' darts when the God speak
Take money, I'm be grant you a heart beat
Respect my office hours
Reach for the 'sket and off the coward
I'm married to the game, make the best man send a
Shot that goes zoom like an X-Men member
Ya'll niggas fuck around with rap
I don't fuck around, I'll fuck around and pound your hat
Walk around to diminish you dumb bastards
Bucktown, the Originoo Gun Clappaz, P
Fuck outta here
