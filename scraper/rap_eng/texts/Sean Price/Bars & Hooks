La Musica De Harry Fraud...

[Hook: The Incomparable Shakespeare]
It's all about bars and hooks
We in the 'hood with cop cars and crooks
We keep it movin', though
It's all about bars and hooks
We in the 'hood with cop cars and crooks
We keep it movin', though
It's all about bars and hooks
We in the 'hood with cop cars and crooks
We keep it movin', though
We keep it movin', though
We keep it movin', though
We keep it movin', though

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Man, you cats ain't slick and your raps ain't shit
I ain't been the same since I ate paint chips
Amazing how I rip and ride reckless
Record a song and I'm gone - Slip-N-Slide Records
Duck Down is the label - Ruck down is the label
Everything I drop - score, touchdown for the label
Now back to the point of the record
I ran a red light, the cops put a point on my record
What the fuck am I talkin' 'bout?
Excessive E pills give you Christopher Walken mouth
Don't rap and chew bubblegum
Big-ass gat, when I clap I do trouble, son
Merked for your chain, talk tough, turbulent slang
Spit crack, and I ain't talkin' 'bout workin' for Wayne
I'm talkin' 'bout the earth and the rain, the moon and the stars
Talkin' 'bout the jerks in the game, you know who you are

[Hook: The Incomparable Shakespeare]
It's all about bars and hooks
We in the 'hood with cop cars and crooks
We keep it movin', though
It's all about bars and hooks
We in the 'hood with cop cars and crooks
We keep it movin', though
It's all about bars and hooks
We in the 'hood with cop cars and crooks
We keep it movin', though
We keep it movin', though
We keep it movin', though
We keep it movin', though

[Verse 2: AWKWORD]
Man, you thugs ain't tough and your raps ain't touch
I ain't been the same since I drank them drugs
Amazing how I spit on a record - it go "POW!"
Amazing how you shit on a record - it slow down
Now pick it back up, we can start where we started at
I spit for fiends, the generation of Starter caps
Can't rock tight jeans, never a thought of that
You ain't make me - Monday morning quarterback
I've been one with the streets, fuck would I lie 'bout?
Excessive Viagra, Donatella Versace mouth
Bastard... (don't rap and chew bubblegum)
Insomniac - I swing the bat when the trouble come
Ain't talkin' 'bout you, son, this is bigger than one star
I'm talkin' moon, tides, gods, bigger-than-Earth bars
I'm talkin' 'bout the talkers, who don't work hard
All the jerks in the game, we know who you are

[Hook: The Incomparable Shakespeare]
It's all about bars and hooks
We in the 'hood with cop cars and crooks
We keep it movin', though
It's all about bars and hooks
We in the 'hood with cop cars and crooks
We keep it movin', though
It's all about bars and hooks
We in the 'hood with cop cars and crooks
We keep it movin', though
We keep it movin', though
We keep it movin', though
We keep it movin', though

[Verse 3: The Kid Daytona]
Man, your flow's Fugazi, you should never rap again
I ain't been the same since I fucked my first African
5'10, fluent in Arabic when she flew in
Red-flagging her, same last name as who flew them planes
And crashed 'em all, into the World Trade
Her uncle sold a fake Louis in front of Pearl Paint
This sure ain't, what life was like in the Bronx
Reminiscing on days, we broke, night in the park
And just seein' fiends smokin' out
Excessive crack rock give you Malik Yoba mouth
Little stories you wrote about
Over stoves and coffee pots, never no Folgers out
Yeah - need to hold ' em out, no shorts, hold it down
Industry funny style, can't avoid clowns
Embarrassed to say, I know some of y'all
Fuckin' faggots in the game, we know who you are

[Hook: The Incomparable Shakespeare]
It's all about bars and hooks
We in the 'hood with cop cars and crooks
We keep it movin', though
It's all about bars and hooks
We in the 'hood with cop cars and crooks
We keep it movin', though
It's all about bars and hooks
We in the 'hood with cop cars and crooks
We keep it movin', though
We keep it movin', though
We keep it movin', though
We keep it movin', though
