[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Formaladehyde toking
Purple heart turn pink, ya calamine lotion
Pal of mine smoking, took two pulls
Trench coat and a big gun he columbine joking
Bark the four at your apartment door
Scared, now prepare for The Art of War
P! Still plan murder
Bullets butter your grill, Hill Hamburger
Advance to the gun it's heat
Slug to your feet make you dance to the drummers beat
Appetite for destruction
Bigotry P, slap a white guy for nothing
Mad drugs in a cargo with heat, P
Bitch said, "Sean you told Harpo to beat me"
Fucking with me the outcome is death
The Green Crack is kush, the talcum is X
Yes

[Verse 2: Illa Ghee]
Tuck your chain, Tec nuzzle and a knuckle game
Hustle game, blood puddles in the sewer drain
Flow shooter, soloist, deuce rugers
Throwing bodies off the roof, Im a roof bruiser
Top seater, box in the hot remix
Time is cold so the water on my watch freezes
Knock a girl off have her knock kneeded
Illa breed is a form of disease
Im a creed of corporate comatose your office
Ployed to destroy and employ your bosses
Fuck everybody the Illa needs reinforcements
Redefine lines with street killer endorsements
I rap like an indoor war, smoking indo
My pen like a swim off shore
Yeah I'm cocky, a oxy, I'm out of it
The black Rocky, Illa Ghee bodied it
