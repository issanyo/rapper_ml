[5 Ft.]
Yeah, come on, yeah, come on
Yeah, throw ya hands up, come on, yeah, come on, yeah
Sean P! Sean P!
Get at these niggas, son!

[Sean Price]
You can catch me in a tenement
Doing too much drugs, straight Jimi Hendrix-in'
Pop's a drinker, my mom's on dope
Pick up they bad habit, now the God do both
Popping some pills, sniffing a line, drinking some wine
Up in the club, grabbing my gun, fucking with Shyne
Bling bling (bling bling) it's a Sean Price thing
Too many clowns want the crown, but there's only one king
I'm the King, ask Rock, there is none higher
Bitch ass niggas better call me sire
Burn my kingdom, must use fire
Big bag of weed, a dutch and some E-Z Wider
Yo, Ruck had a drug habit and all
Bust matics, chrome static I ain't fucking with y'all
Don't get my hands dirty, I got goons that spray
Quick to kill a motherfucker, like boom bye yeah

Dru Ha, what up, yeah yeah
Buckshot, what up, yeah yeah
Big Rock, what up, yo yo
Tek and Steel what up, yo

"First name Sean, last name Price"

[Sean Price]
I step in the ring weighing an even two hundred
Lost twenty pounds in B-ville, fucking around with E pills
So I took a trip to Jack LaLanne
Got my weight back like that when I snatched the chain
Duke I'm hardcore, far more than the average
In Job Corps, I smoked more than you bastards
Y'all niggas ain't fucking with Ruck
Wilding out like it's dust in my dutch, motherfucker
Stupid bitches think the God got plenty dough
Just because they saw a motherfucker up on Jenny Jones
Have to step back and laugh at these hoes
I'm Sean Price, the brokest rapper you know
Nice to meet ya
Ike Turner when rocking the wife beater
You step on my toes, hoes and you're wiping my sneakers

Rustee Juxx, what up, yo yo
Illa Noyz, what up, yo yo
Elroy, what up, yo yo
Sethlow, what up, yo

"First name Sean, last name Price"

[Sean Price]
You can say what you want, just spell my name right
First name Sean, last name Price
Nigga I'm David Ruffin in the flesh
Fucked up in the game, but never the less, I'm the best
Y'all niggas be rhyming about nothing
I rhyme about nothing, and sound like something
I used to sell crack and listen to Redman
Now I smoke black, while I'm getting some head, damn
Sean Price, always broker than most
That's why the gunsmoke choke in your throat
Stick 'em up
Put your hands where my eyes can see
Yo, this ain't Busta Rhymes, bong!
Bust a nine, bong!
Roughest and toughest, so don't fuck with mine
I will, snuff 'em and cut 'em, before he fuck with mine, yo

What up
GRB, what up
Dan the man, what up
Sean Price, what up
