[Intro: J.T. Cavey]
Irreversible

[Verse 1: J.T. Cavey]
A sequence of events unfolding in reverse
A sting better stimulated when revealing tragedy first
Reverse perception reversing imperfection
Be aware of the darkness that lies beneath the surface of contrived pleasantries
Be aware so as to always hold tighter; speak softer
There is no failsafe, so now you know
There is no failsafe, so cut ties
With the dead weight that is dragging you below

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Pull me closer, when silence consumes you, I'll speak words softer
Sinking slower, we stimulate the sting, restrain

[Verse 2: J.T. Cavey]
I'm not giving up, I'm giving in to the touch
Of every inch of your sea salt skin
But you set me ablaze and spread me out with waves in the ocean
With every trace of doubt, black me out
Don't stimulate the sting
Don't let the wrong choices repeat themselves
Don't stimulate the sting of irreversible emptiness
Pull me in close, pull me in close

[Bridge: Jesse Cash]
It's in the empty spaces that we find ourselves
It's in the empty spaces, reaching out and grasping
Searching for what we need to find who we are, who we are
There is no failsafe
It's what keeps me hanging on to what you are to me
You're what keeps me hanging on
I'm not giving up, I'm giving in, so let's begin again

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
Pull me closer, when silence consumes you, I'll speak words softer
Sinking slower, we stimulate the sting, restrain
Pulling you closer 'cause after all, you're pulling back farther
And we're sinking slower, we stimulate the sting, restrain

[Outro: J.T. Cavey]
Don't turn your back on her
Let her look you right in the eyes, you coward, oh
Don't stimulate the sting
Don't let the wrong choices repeat themselves
Don't stimulate the sting of irreversible emptiness
