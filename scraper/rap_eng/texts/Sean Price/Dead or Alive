[Intro: Sean Price]
What do I love about rap?
Me
You know you really had to be saying something and say it well when I first came in the game
Now they say anything, so I can tell that these kids don't have a lot of schooling man
They sound like idiots
I'm nice
I don't care what they say as long as they go, "yo Sean P go in!"
I can live with that

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
P!
Better rapper
Beretta clapper
The clever bastard
Metal masher
Devil laughter
Cheddar after
After the gold then after that the platinum, no
After your soul then after that I clap 'em, yo
Make your back spin, the four bust
Back when used to back spin for Cold Crush
Up so tough some dumb guy
Wanna die?
For sho nuff plus the kung fu fly
I'm up to spar
I'm up to par
I'll fuck up your jaw like fuck you, par
P, the veteran injure
Michael Dudikoff the American Ninja
Insane with the best flow holla
Private planes with Creflo Dollar
You hear Sean working B
I'm the truth and duke is just a circus freak
P

[Chorus: Bernadette Price]
Dead or alive y'all niggas can't fuck with P
Bernadette and the league who the fuck you be?
Fronting on P, you get your head busted quick
Many niggas claim loyal but they all full of shit
Gorilla the beat
Decept P ringing bells in the streets
Plus degrees y'all niggas can't fuck with P
Imperious Rex
Sean is the best
Punching your chest
Put you to rest
Bitch

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Four-fifth in your face
And your facility of fuck boys forfeit in your face
Shitting, mortician sippin' on grapes
Prepaid, premeditated, murder the 8th, P!
Idiot kinfolks
AKA the ape in the window (Magilla)
I traffic and [?] doja
A Budweiser African king poster
I'm doing my damn thing
Y'all niggas claim king and ain't doing a damn thing
That's my word to my moms
I never heard not one of your songs, fuck out of here
And I don't dislike you
I dislike the dude who said disliked you
Long kiss, long fifth bitch goodbye
Can't fuck with P, new fish to fry

[Chorus: Bernadette Price]
Dead or alive y'all niggas can't fuck with P
Bernadette and the league who the fuck you be?
Fronting on P, you get your head busted quick
Many niggas claim loyal but they all full of shit
Gorilla the beat
Decept P ringing bells in the streets
Plus degrees y'all niggas can't fuck with P
Imperious Rex
Sean is the best
Punching your chest
Put you to rest
Bitch

[Outro: Sean Price]
If I slap a nigga you could hear that shit across the street
Word is bond, I got kicked out of school for that
The principle suspended me like, "what was that?"
I got arrested for noise pollution
Feel me? I smacked earth wind and fire out of niggas, word to mother
