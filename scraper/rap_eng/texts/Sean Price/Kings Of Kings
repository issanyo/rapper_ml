[Sean Price]
Ayo fade to black and Sean Price statin' the facts
I wipe my ass with the Patriot Act
Catch a capital crime
Kill a cop when I'm clappin' my nine
Real talk, I ain't rappin' in rhyme
Duke I rap for the doe
I rap for the cause, I'm rappin' because
My son right here
Needs new shoes, socks and drawers
I rap, cause most rappers ain't doin' it right
Doin' it wrong
What you do when you're doin' a song
Dude an Afro American
Yeah I sell a cracker crack bust a gat, rap pattern
All mathematics when the god blast ratchets
Hole in your cabbage peep the soul of a savage
Sean Price
I'm back by popular demand
With a pack of crack that papi be popular with friends
Get hurt, wet shirt, wet work expert
Network whenever the fuck Ruck's tec burst
