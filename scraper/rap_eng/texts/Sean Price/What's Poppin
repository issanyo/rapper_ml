[Verse 1: Steele]
What you don't know might kill you
If Tek don't, Steele will
Catch you in the projects where you and your peeps chill
Rap niggas get deals and think they safe
Really think mass killings won't run in your place
Y'all niggas keep acting like you slug resistant
Oh you a thug, cut your throat in the club while you pissing
Fuck the glamor shit, this is rubber grip, arm and hammer shit
When the lights flash that means it's lights out like when the camera kick
Can you handle it? Man to man let's see if you can handle this
Rap battling, street fights and gun brandishing
Nine rattling, innocent bystanders scattering
Fuck converstation, procrastination and lip chattering
Hits landing when I send shots through your abdomen
Dead body lay froze in the cold for the cameraman
All for thinking Steele don't hold weight
Gold Lex, gold plates with gold twin tre-eights

[Hook: Tek]
For my copping niggas, outlet shopping niggas
Bank stopping, Mickey in the middle dropping niggas
What's poppin' niggas, where them bitches at?
Reefer's at? I know you heard the beast is back
For my copping niggas, outlet shopping niggas
Bank stopping, Mickey in the middle dropping niggas
What's poppin' niggas, where them bitches at?
Reefer's at? I know you heard the beast is back

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Yo, now if you say you heard the rhyme, I have to bust the lead
'Cause I just made this motherfucker from top of the head
What it look like? Fuck what you like, look you type shook
Make your ass buckle, brass knuckles from the right hook
When I head dreads niggas said that's a Christ look
When I saw feds, duke I fled in my nice look
Know that ain't your girl 'cause my little brother Mike took
That bitch to the crib, sucked me off 'cause she like crooks
Motherfuck school even though a nigga like books
Mad street smart, heat spark like your life took
Swift on my toes niggas call me "Shorty Lightfoot"
Slip X to your ex now your ex wife took
Sean Price precise vocalist, might smoke a spliff
Might provoke a chick to deep throat a dick, keep quoting it
We noticed this nigga on stage is mad wack though
Talking this, that and the third, word? That's an act yo

For my copping niggas, outlet shopping niggas
Bank stopping, Mickey in the middle dropping niggas
What's poppin' niggas, where them bitches at?
Reefer's at? I know you heard the beast is back
For my copping niggas, outlet shopping niggas
Bank stopping, Mickey in the middle dropping niggas
What's poppin' niggas, where them bitches at?
Reefer's at? I know you heard the beast is back

[Verse 3: Tek]
For that paper I stakeout in front of your crib
Know precisely the time of day you taking a shit
Or reading to your kids, I see you walking your dog
Suddenly your like a cross or be nothing at all
I'm the boss of the outfit, talk with a slight pitch
Go through the walls in your crib to get them bricks
I know a few kids who stay where you live
Your money or your life, which one you willing to give?
Ask my nigga [?] Scrooge what I do for my dudes
Keep on being greedy, watch me poison your food
Run through your crew, nothing but bitches with attitudes
That front for other bitches and some killer I know
Can't be mad at the game just hate how it go
Just for the dough push through the thunder and snow
Or let the four-four push through your vest and your throat
Think it's a joke, 'til our barrel's filled up with smoke
And the pork go into your crib, inform on your folks
