Intro:
Brooklyn (Chant)
Where you from?
"Live in the land of crooks, yes Brooklyn's the borough"

Verse 1: Sean Price
P, the nicest nigga in the borough
Sean Price nice and all of my verses thorough
Lotta niggas spittin', but none of y'all niggas Ruck raw
Rappin' after P, I'm like pfff, what the fuck for
Listen, don't fuck with the best
I'll cut your hands off, so you can upchuck your set
Ruck is a vet, when touchin' the sket
Your whole life say goodnight, like the cousin of death
Asthma attack rap, don't get punched in the chest
You will suck on your suck seeds when suckin' on cess
My criminal mind impervious to submission
My criminal rhyme will burn a fifth at you bitches
Highly unlikely to find a nigga betta
Kojack, Columbo cold rockin' berettas (bong)
Blam, blam, duke you Canada cooked
Mother fuckin' Sean Price in the land of the crooks

Verse 2: Billy Danze
So where you from:
Birthplace of everything gritty, so I don't need the intro
Y'all know it's worth bro, hang it out the window
'87 stick up kids study my mental
I'm ambidextrous widdit, nigga don't forget it
When it comes to this rap shit I really represent it
Above average nigga, I keeps it authentic
Hood savage nigga, with both feet in it
Brownsville, court cases pending till the endin'
This is copper top city, headshot clappers
I'm slightly out of pocket, portrayin' to be a rapper
Rock out in Japan, land the mornin' after
And bet it on the block like (errr), nigga what's happenin'
Cruise past the home where Capone once lived
Get flashbacks of Frank Nitty doin' what he did
Outside of Al Sharpton, we all shooters
And support the makers of Llamas, Lugers and Rugers

Hook 2: DJ Babu

Verse 3:  Maffew Ragazino
It's senior, uh
Ain't no shook hands in Brooklyn
I'm from where the jooks scam and cook grams
Crack rock zombies goin' super HAM
In Vietnam, the war's on, my hooligans
I'll probably back track down and book fam
If they see 'em in the community nigga food man
R.I.P. MCA, no sleep till
Never ran, never will nigga B-Ville (Brownsville)
Salvaged denim and my Jordan IIs
Black mobb boss ring leader, motley crew
My bitches a stallion, no horse shoes
I only pop bottles wine bottles that need cork screws
Nets fan cause the Knicks ain't shit
Number one whether or not they win a championship
I'm from the only mother fuckin' borough with a team
Brooklyn, NYC (Senior)
