[Intro: Sean Price]
Yeah
Uh
Yaooo

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Sean Price, King Kong in the place
Big gun, watch the bullet bing bong in ya face
Murdered the bastard, he murders the surgery plastic
Face reconstruction when the 8 heating something, uh!
Touch you bad when you hit with the hard hawk
P! My knuckles drag when the God walk
I ain't old school, I ain't new school
I'm a dropout with the tool that pop out
I'm the shit up in my hood
I had three wishes; I wish that a nigga would
Step to the God, when God step I step on ya squad
Imperius Rex the best, definition: The God
I swing things hurtin'
God body AKA the King James version
Playing my shit the same time hating my shit
Don't play at me bitch, I make your bitch play with my dick

[Hook: Sean Price Cuts]
I'm, the King ask Rock; there is none higher
Th'fuck rhyme better than me?
P, P, P!
Nigga, I'm nothin to play with
Kneel down, kiss the ring
Listen
I'm, the King ask Rock; there is none higher
The fuck rhyme better than me?
P, P, P!
Nigga, I'm nothin to play with
God body, AKA the King James version

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
I used to dispurse raw
Behind my mom's back and she lived on the first floor
Heard yours, I hurt your feelings
Feelings get hurt, gun burst and earth your ceiling, P!
Appetite for destruction
Savage life might strike a dyke if you fronting
Write something
Never polite, ignite the mic slice something
Loot for a curl, rappin' at you; you cute for a girl
I 'url on you duke, now you be the Duke of the Earl
Listen, don't make dollars that don't make sense
I do make dollars, dumb bars don't make cents, uh!
The education of Sean Price
Dedication, the medication and long nights
Smokin' the pancake
Work on consignment, lot of dope for a handshake

[Hook: Sean  Price-less Cuts]
I'm, the King ask Rock; there is none higher
Th'fuck rhyme better than me?
P, P, P!
Nigga, I'm nothin to play with
Kneel down, kiss the ring
Listen
I'm, the King ask Rock; there is none higher
Th'fuck rhyme better than me?
P, P, P!
Nigga, I'm nothin to play with
God body, AKA the King James version

THE CROWN IS MINE

[Outro: Sean Price]
I'm not your friend dukes
Don't talk to me like that
Word...the friend thing?
We're not friends...
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS
Be clear on that....clearly we're not...
The Stephen A Smith voice:
Clearly we're not friends....clearly
You being my friend is asinine, ass-a-ten, ass-eleven
