VERSE 1 – Jake Palumbo

I smack a hipster back to DUMBO
Unsportsmanlike conduct, Dikembe Palumbo
Regretfully never acting my age
World Television Champ, Lorenzo Lamas – Renegade
I'm vexed & left hanging in the vestibule
You'll soon be regrettable for questioning my vision
Unquestionable I got more heart in my left testicle
Moved to Brooklyn back when that was still a questionable decision
Back when Giuliani was getting rid of Orange Julius
I was fool enough to think that I could really do this
Buster Keaton, with a deadpan expression
Deadpool ambition, Part III Lethal Weapon
Mene Gene interview, off the head, hexed stupor
Superman's cool, but we influenced by Lex Luthor
Shoot the fair one? Never
Rather shoot you for tresspassing
Test pressing, white-label, money order, check cashing

HOOK (Scratching):
On stage with the planet in the palm of my hand
Whatever I'm spitting on
Get with the business
Royalty from the County of Kings
I'll still be on the grind when it all collapse, &
You'll be first to catch this beat-down
I got Brooklyn manners, & Tennessee tendencies
Deep discussions, turn to deep concussions
Professor, pound in my dresser
Overstand the underhanded ways of my camp, B

VERSE 2 – Sean Price

Welcome to Brownsville, my kids it ain't a jungle
Got a lot of blocks, Ahk – Dikembe Mutumbo
French Spader gun blow, Timbs beige & gum-sole
Got blood on the bottom, thugs up in Sodom
Savage life, appetite for destruction
Bagging white, smack a hermaphrodite in the function
Conjuction Junction, you f***s is pumpkin
Pie, I am fly, awesome Henny consumption
Too old for bulls***, playtime is over
Grey 9 with the mule-kick, playtime for doujas
Rap real life, life really's a wrap
Your s*** b**** weak, 16 is 6 feet deep
Baby bar, par, crap in your diapers
I'm crazy, I don't play with y'all
Crack in the pipers
Get the memo
Sean been hard since the days of “It's A Demo”
P!

(REPEAT HOOK)

VERSE 3 – Jake Palumbo

Respectful honky, amicable Anglo
Productive junkie, eat a Xanax with a mango
Annex your assets by any means needed
Half this board meeting don't seem to realize I'm weeded
Southern hospitality, humble to a fault
But you push the wrong button, got no problems with assault
You getting mushy, spending money on your lady
I'm getting pussy wearing clothes from Old Navy
But my Ralph Lauren Polo's are pressed up like vinyl
Address me as Your Highness in the presence of your rivals
Electrified Blanka, fighting M. Bison
Finally earned a shot for 16 with Mic Tyson
Jake Palumbo, Jake Steed, Jake Lamotta
Jake It Till You Make It, take the money, make it hotter
Born in Tennessee you tend to see a lot of firearms
Fire out your speakers guaranteed as long as I'm on

(REPEAT HOOK)
