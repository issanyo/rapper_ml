[Intro]
P!

[Chorus: Freeway]
Real artists
Fake artists
Hot artists
Wack artists
Hard artists
Soft artists
I'm addressing all artists
I'm a prisoner, a slave to this rap
Got to pay to get your boys back
I'ma kidnap artists
Real artists
Fake artists
Strong artists
Weak artists
Tight jeans wearing new rap R&B artists
I'm a prisoner, a slave to this rap
Get a shovel for them cats
I will six feet deep artists

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Who rap like rap is supposed to sound?
New cats type wack I won't disown you clown
Fuck a first round draft pick
Burst pound gat spit
Search frown
Hearse found
I dirt bound that bitch
P, respect raw flavor
The sket drawn, fuck if you my next door neighbor
Uncivilized acts from a civilized cat
Knowledge my wisdom
I hit 'em, now criticize that
Nigga, fuck a rap critic
I clap cynics all in your back in the black civic
P, might knife him and spit on his kid
Brownsville, Mic Tyson, Riddick and Briggs
Zab Judah
Gears in tact with the black Supra's
Knife in the gun fight, trying to stab Rugers
Nigga your time is comin'
Fuck with me and your time is now, get to runnin'

[Chorus: Freeway]
Real artists
Fake artists
Hot artists
Wack artists
Hard artists

I'm addressing all artists
I'm a prisoner, a slave to this rap
Got to pay to get your boys back
I'ma kidnap artists
Real artists
Fake artists
Strong artists
Weak artists
Tight jeans wearing new rap R&B artists
I'm a prisoner, a slave to this rap
Get a shovel for them cats
I will six feet deep artists

[Verse 2: Freeway]
Who flow like legends are supposed to flow?
Big beard like Al-Qaeda, I'm supposed to blow
King Midas, everything I touch supposed to go
At least gold, maybe platinum if I roast it slow
You are tuned in to the winners and the winner hit the Aspens
We don't take our women to the Poconos
Now I get dough from rap, before I used to hold the coke
Duck the cops bob and weave, Ali rope-a-dope
No we don't lease cars you could hold the note
We premium I'm like a medium how I control the ghost
It's very rarely that we prefer to boast
My rap songs got me plush homes and motor boats
New Rothschild got it locked, we control the books
Hold it down for Sean P, he control the crooks
You my muslim brother, and my other brother
Like my mother's son, see you in heaven brother

[Chorus: Freeway]
Real artists
Fake artists
Hot artists
Wack artists
Hard artists
Soft artists
I'm addressing all artists
I'm a prisoner, a slave to this rap
Got to pay to get your boys back
I'ma kidnap artists
Real artists
Fake artists
Strong artists
Weak artists
Tight jeans wearing new rap R&B artists
I'm a prisoner, a slave to this rap
Get a shovel for them cats
I will six feet deep artists

[Verse 3: Sean Price]
It go industry rule number 4000 and 80 something
Record labels, they ain't sayin' nothing
Lime for a lemon and a lemon for lime rhyme
Nine to your melon and swell up your mind time
P! I'm prime time, Deon Sanders
School of Hard Knocks, see P on campus
Baby shit bar par, you need Pampers
Display the fifth, charge y'all, who need answers
Shot my crew
Ruckdown rhyming is true
Talk, you thought I was signing with Dru
You're new style tender
Style futile to a Lew Alcindor
I'm wild, criminal style and shoot y'all injured
Divide ending with guys collide, brute agenda
I fight all you clowns
Goodnight strike then you all fall down
P!

[Chorus: Freeway]

Tight jeans wearing new rap R&B artists
I'm a prisoner, a slave to this rap
Get a shovel for them cats
I will six feet deep artists
