[Intro: Poison Pen]
Sean P
Poison Pen
Swave Sevah
Son of the one arm man
The money shot, nigga
Kimbo Price, nigga
Lennox Ave, nigga
NA rock, nigga
This all I need right here son
What up!

[Verse One: Poison Pen]
Give me the pussy, the money, the mic and I'm straight
Pass the fully, the rum, no ice, and I'm great
Bed-Stuy brawny, Bed-Stuy bruising
One man bless the army with that lead pipe music
We ain't in the same game, you see these suckers?
Now it's cool to play lame, fucking busters
Things changed, why these little niggas dressing like Dwyane Wayans?
Select few of these dudes will move me
When I hit you, you sound like coward do in a movie
Nah you can't allude from the two piece
That's how I do nigga sue me
Run all up on your set with such timing
Dump 'em all off with your sket and clutch iron
He gonna be on the news if son try me
Bleed all over your jewels, they blood diamonds

[Verse Two: Swave Sevah]
Bars of death, flow fire, verse char your flesh
It's terror whenever Sevah and the Gods connect
Open season homie guard your neck
See it's kill or be killed, don't be the one we target next
Too late, remove safety, aim steady, semi blam
Declaring war on any man in skinny pants
Walk with a torch and a bucket of ether
For the next nigga I see with his jeans tucked in his sneakers
I'm old school, brutality rap
Knifes to your nostrils, nigga run your salary cap
There's a difference, talk shit 'cause your battery charged
Me, I talk shit and then catch a battery charge
Sweet threats, I won't just insult ya
Pull the sket you better jet or end up like Jett Travolta
Brooklyn bullies and Harlem vikings
I'm [?], slaughter your squad like spartans fighting

[Verse Three: Sean Price]
I be the fear factor, the rapper
Come back here, smack your ear
Take your Jack Herer, smoke in the clear wrapper
You punk's sweet, you food
Lunch meat, I'm rude
Dump heat, leave you slumps sleep, nigga you're drooled
Fuck you and the crackers that own you
I own two, guns that will pop off your crown and dethrone you
Abdul-Jabbar versus Mugsy Malone you
I don't know what that mean, but you know what I mean when I told you
I'm old school, new school, I'm a drop out
Got my GED back in the game, now pull your guap out
Opt out your contract, pop out the crons clap a nigga
Let the motherfuckers know that Sean's back
My president is black, the cocaine is white
The nine nickel plated, nigga who fixing the fight
Sean Price, a motherfucking, motherfucker
Motherfucker
