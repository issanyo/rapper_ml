[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Ahead of my time, y'all niggas saw the left of my nine
Bust a shot, hit a cop, and that's a federal crime
But before I go to jail and do the federal time
Eat my wife's pussy, incredible, edible, dime
Petro said "Ruckus you can't do it again"
Let the sket blow fuck it, now I'm losing a friend
Sean Price is the best around
Nigga's Ray Charles with it, doing the damn "Mess Around"
I will back out the iron and press this clown
I will smack fire for lying and wet this clown
No joke Rakim Allah
Fuck a drive by, drive by me and I'mma pop at your car
Listen, push that crack, push that rap, good
When I push that Lac you look at that, hood
Wanna know who the fuck I'm signed to
What difference do it make bitch?
Listen to the tape deck
P!

[Sample]
Think they give a fuck what your thinking, fuck your thoughts
I'm god and bitch you not
And bitch you not

[Outro: Sean Price]
Listen, I be that insane nigga from the psycho ward
In-insane nigga from the psycho ward
Be that insane nigga from the psycho ward
In-insane nigga, In-in-insane nigga
Be that insane nigga from the psycho ward
In-insane nigga from the psycho ward
Be that insane nigga from the psycho ward
In-insane nigga, In-in-insane nigga
