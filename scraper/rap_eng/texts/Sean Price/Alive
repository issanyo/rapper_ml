[Hook: Sample]
They may shoot you
They may cut you
They may drown you
I just don't know
Now you don't see me
I'm the big boss
After they take care of you
I do the payin' off

[Verse 1: Mic Handz]
Yeah, hit it, okay
I see you crab ass, snake in the grass, phony constituents
Tryna take shots at the spot the god sittin' in
Tryna walk a mile in the sneakers the god limpin' in
Tryna act wild like my squad ain't the squad liftin' 'em
I see you simpletons ain't hardly a threat
No competition or competitors in light of a vet
Just Handz, boss man status
Proven to be the baddest
Leaving thangs on that midnight train, go ask Gladys
(We here baby, all day every day)
We outta here, another year gon' make 'em Duck Down
Sean P, and M-I-C straight outta Bucktown
It's big Mikey, pimp like he Wilt Chamberlin
Up in them sick nights, a dirt bike, it ain't crazy men
Broad back muscle, juggling side hustles
Shuffling racks, tallying stacks we gon' duffle
Gangster grill, ill to the bill of my Nets fitted
I'm Brooklyn 'til the day that I die, come fuck with it

They may shoot you
They may cut you
They may drown you
I just don't know
Now you don't see me
I'm the big boss (Aha, hm)
After they take care of you (Yo, yo)
I do the payin' off (Yo)

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Yo, son of a gun, son of a rifle
D-O-A, G-O-A, gun on arrival
Niggas call me Jesus, not the one in the Bible
The one from Brownsville selling pills to Pirus
No hate, sell weight to Crips, too
Shawshank, big ape ready to lift dudes
True, I don't play that papi
Shake hoes, Pesos, ASAP Rocky
Ice in the range, every day that's hockey
Nikes in the rain, every day that's sloppy
Cocaine Cowboy, Hi Ho Silver (Hai)
Pronto, call Tonto, I don't deliver
P, bar for bar, nigga I am the best out
Left-back niggas get schooled then left out
Valedictorian
Fuck rap ciphers 'cause that battle shit boring P
(Motherfucker, God damn it)
