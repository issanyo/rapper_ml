[Verse 1: Sean Price]

Listen, me getting burnt or hurt, pah never that
I got rhymes up the ass, give me some ex-lax
Shit on these niggas thinking that they better than Sean
Fuck around and leave your head on the lawn
Listen, MC ultra, Saturday Night Live, John Travolta
Saturday Night special pah, I will assault ya
Y'all motherfuckers living the herb life, 'burb type
Sean a two time felon, working on third strike
Listen, like rapping but I like to shoot
If I get knocked I'll just join a Lifers' Group
I'm righteous duke, all praises due to the Most High
Sour diesel and haze, I guess I'm the most high
My sneakers cost two g's, I'm the most fly
You pussy, security rock suits and bow-ties
Sean Price the best rapper you ever heard
Encyclopedia Brown, the clown with the clever words
P!

[Hook]
Legendary in the hood how I got my cash
Write lines for criminal minds to listen to
C'mon, you niggas know me
Dangerous, we goodfellas, niggas can't bang with us
Legendary in the hood how I got my cash
Write lines for criminal minds to listen to
C'mon, you niggas know me
Dangerous, we goodfellas

[Verse 2]

Moving bricks, trafficking white, the shit that I conspire to
My hustling niggas, music to inspire you
You know the name, it hold weight in the street
I put that powder on the strip, we ain't waiting to eat
So let the paper stack tall, over niggas heads
And I'ma smoke the face cause the taste is that raw
So to my folk uptown, good looking out
They run the block proper, niggas pitching niggas looking out
But 'round here, the crime is unorganized
Everybody getting this money ain't been authorized
Though my integrity is nothing, it's just irration-al
You niggas is local and I'm international
Young Bro got that anywhere ghetto pass
Cause where you from a question real niggas never ask
It's where you at, so everywhere I'm at
Niggas be prepared to clap, clutch on their berettas fast

[Verse 3]

This what I do
Tell a couple young'ns hold this corner down
Tell them Tizzy sent you, they won't even stare you down
They'll let you go 'head and get your paper
They'll even pop off if they see someone try and blaze ya
Yeah I got plugs with the good
And only real niggas get love in the hood
The snub with the wood is the perfect weapon
The prints don't stick so if they find it you good
It's a lie I never could hard times is too real
I really will shoot steel, straight through your ice grill
But I'd rather fall back
Get money, count stacks
As far as the cake mix, the boy is about that
I hit him with eight bricks, he hit me with all that
Change so I just had to [?] with more packs
Shit my moms fell victim to the game
While most parents in the hood fell victim to the 'caine
I'm addicted to the change, I gotta get it
But I'd rather get it over beats that blaze
