[Verse 1]
Fuck Christmas, fuck this shit
Stick my dick in a box, fuck this gift
You sleeping, that's the cousin of death
I take every gift under the tree 'til it ain't none left
I'm a mean one, call me Mr.Grinch
Unwashed socks, the Glock make niggas flinch
Thief by night that'll fuck up your day
Wash my nuts with your toothbrush you have it on display
I don't give a shit, I ain't getting shit
I hate spitting this plus I hate St.Nicholas
You wake up while I'm taking your shit
That's when I smack blood out your little innocent bitch
Candy cane, ain't no 'caine in the candy
Just some sugary bullshit, the tree look fancy
Fuck you and your Christmas tree
I'm the Grinch, you call me P
Motherfuckers!

[Hook]
You're a foul one
You're a nasty Mr.Grinch

[Verse 2]
Was the night before Christmas, and all through the P's
Was a motherfucking thief and his name was P
He still sell drugs and occasionally shoot shit
Don't ho ho ho's, but he stay in some new kicks
I'll be back with Easter, I like to choke rabbits
But now I'm with Rudolph, he got a coke habit
Better believe P wordplay
Almost feel guilty cause it's Jesus' birthday
P!

[Hook]
