[Verse 1: Illa Ghee]
I expose all man for his lack of gravity
Weak morality, meek profanity
Illa Ghee speak drugs and cavitys
Smack humanity
Attack insanity
Hand in the name of your Christianity
Cut across cousins and divorce of families
Force feed niggas, books I read niggas
So nice with the flow I spit disease nigga
Born Aristotle, I'm Judas new apostle
Crack out the bottle
A priest inside a brothel
Boy I'm like angel dust and waffles
Verse like remello when you see this boy goggles
Google me
Illa body musically and brutally
Understand confusingly
Live type truthfully
Like a mountain no moving me
All black roles, of the souls of a mutiny

[Chorus: Illa Ghee]
How you want it, hot slug or a pickaxe?
This is how a rapper dies off a sick track
Get jacked, get whacked or either get smacked
Pound out or stomped out, sudden impact
How you want it, hot slug or a pickaxe?
This is how a rapper dies off a sick track
Get jacked, get whacked or either get smacked
Pound out or stomped out, sudden impact

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Say Price is nice
Not the play type, I will Ray Rice your wife
Trife thinking
Shots from the rifle sink in
Your chest, never the lest I'm blessed, [?]
Dear Jesus, John and Mary
Sean is scary
Bizarre bars that be varied
Spray shots tremendous
Shot on Saturday, hooray the seven day adventist
Speech hard, smart the same
Piece spark, I will beef tartar your brain
Rhyme all the time never mettle with thoughts
I'm shooting all the time like Carmelo on the court
Excel to the top but put the mic down
The hell with the cops the popped the Mike Brown
Son clapped the biscuit
Dumb raps explicit
Young black and gifted
P

[Chorus: Illa Ghee]
How you want it, hot slug or a pickaxe?
This is how a rapper dies off a sick track
Get jacked, get whacked or either get smacked
Pound out or stomped out, sudden impact
How you want it, hot slug or a pickaxe?
This is how a rapper dies off a sick track
Get jacked, get whacked or either get smacked
Pound out or stomped out, sudden impact
