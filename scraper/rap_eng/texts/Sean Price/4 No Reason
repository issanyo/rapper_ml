[Verse 1]
Benevolent rap cat
Hundred percent real nigga
The president half that
Evident in the rap spat
Make niggas uncomfortable fuckin' with that wack
Every bar is hard
Every hard bar I spit bizarre to ya'll
Every bizarre hard bar up to par
Paw, your bars ain't hard God, I saw your flaws
Can't be him, Boot Camp champion
Your style is equivalent to Ambien
Sleepy, hand me a NoDoz
Most of my friends broke
I hand 'em my old clothes
Meyhem Lauren, he gave me his Rugbys
The weight on the plate great
Play with the drugs, P
Today's math is wisdom culture
Of being born to equality, come follow me, P

[Sample]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I'm a grown ass man
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I'm a grown ass man

[Verse 2]
Back with the lines
Your lines wack, smacked with the rhyme
My shit is right and exact black, I rap all the time
I never try to rhyme like the latest
Rapper out, smack a mouth soon as he say shit
When I spit this rage
Understand motherfucker I got kids your age, P

[Sample]
I know what the fuck a vegetable is man
Don't, don't tell me what a vegetable is man
I'm, ay, I'm a grown ass man, alright?
