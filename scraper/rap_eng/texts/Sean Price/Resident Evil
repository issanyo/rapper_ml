Listen

[Verse 1]
The Groddfather
Big black brother with burners and large armor
Big bottle of brown, call it the car starter
Rape an atheist 'til the bitch say, "our father"
Hail Mary
Brenda Had a Baby
Threw the baby out the window, now Brenda is going crazy
Ignorant fool
Hang with some ignorant dudes
That will do whatever I say long as I give them some food
Never, tell you what to do bitch?
Then look at my eye's that'll tell you what to do bitch
Gangsters move in silence
I'm not a gangster, yet I remain quiet
Pocket forecast broke
Commissary gone already, call Kraft soap
Two heaters, two seaters, the black Lac
I used to use Cheez-It's to battle the jack mac

[Chorus]
It go one gun, two gun, three gun, four
So many weapons, the Ruck is the gun tour
Son saw shit that make you wanna get down
Get up on your good foot, par James Brown
It go one gun, two gun, three gun, four
So many weapons, the Ruck is the gun tour
Son saw shit that make you wanna get down
Get up on your good foot, par James Brown

[Verse 2]
Stop a bastard
The matic
Solve problem when shit get problematic
I'm not your man maggot
I'm not your friend faggot
Pop your friend drastic
Box your chin classic
Hardcore rapper
I am what I am fam and all y'all actors
I hope you win an Emmy
Your bitch like the Jungle Brothers she hope to win a Jimmy
The scope is on the semi black, gat is the heater
Assassinate another black national leader
"Free at last, free at last"
That nigga P got cash and he not ass
Abe Lincoln
Emancipate 8 in your face and the place stinkin'
What I present to the people
A fucked up household, Resident Evil
P!

(The goon)
(Motherfucking goon)
(P!)

[Chorus]
It go one gun, two gun, three gun, four
So many weapons, the Ruck is the gun tour
Son saw shit that make you wanna get down
Get up on your good foot, par James Brown
It go one gun, two gun, three gun, four
So many weapons, the Ruck is the gun tour
Son saw shit that make you wanna get down
Get up on your good foot, par James Brown
