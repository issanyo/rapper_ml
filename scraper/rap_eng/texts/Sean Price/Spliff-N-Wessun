[Sean Price]
It go stop with the bullshit
Playing game niggas, hopskotch when the tool click
Don't make me pop ya
Ya black eye blue, bitch, Frank Sinatra
You see SP, and you be thinking rasta
Think it's peace & love, but I think to drop ya
Fake gangsta rappers, got ya thinking mobster
It's a fact, you're and act, or, think you Oscar's, yo
That's when I slap this jerk
Take his Jesus piece, send him back to Catholic church
Niggas actin' like my motherfuckin' gat don't work
Til you hit and then collapse in the dirt and  screamin' that shit hurt
Motherfuckin' right, that shit hurt
Niggas play tackle football with a plastic Nerf
Bitches with dreadlocks and drapes on they back
Suck dick, plus they make biscuits from scratch

[Ruste Juxx]
Niggas dial 9-11
I told the Smif Wess, one nine, one-one
Forty five's and P2 29's
Storyline, it begins once upon a crime
Rustee Juxx in the gutter like stash crack
Any block, any bitch, I'mma smash that
Aiyo, fuck Force 1's, Juxx stomping in GORE-TEX
Blaze up, fools you walk me through a vortex
Size 3, Brooklyn playalistic
Mossberg, music, duke don't get it twisted

[Sean Price]
Aiyo (I shine) you shine
(In this day in time) we pop off ya head with the nine
(Nah) we not soft, go head with the lies
Duke you a knockoff, ya threads and designs is
Off the table, I'm dead broke, nigga, they cuttin' off my cable

[Ruste Juxx]
The criminal of the year, yea I'm back to rob
So take ya shine off when you see me on the job
Due to the mac, I'm strapped, ready to clap
React, stop runnin' ya yap, and run ya stack
Jaw carryin' chop and blow gems
Slash you in ya Benz, for stoppin' gold rims
Pumpin' on the block, through rocks that glow stim
And I'm rollin' on 10, the size of my Timbs

[Sean Price]
Let me get a turkey sandwich and a bottle of juice please
A dollar change left, fuck it, give me two loosies
We ain't got no trap
Three songs one session, it's econo-rap

[Ruste Juxx]
Still rip a nigga ass, raw rap on the reg
Catch me in the weed spot, cliquing on the dred
See me in the flesh, real liftin' ya chain
All you feel is the flame, fifth in ya frame
In the cut wit ya bitch, feelin' up on her butt and her tits
You wanna fuck but she can start suckin' this dick
I got a click that move more crowds than Eric B
With a shotgun, air hole tech, and Desert Eag's
