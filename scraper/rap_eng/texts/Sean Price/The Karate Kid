[Sean Price]
Cowards begin rap with the wackest lines
Smack powerful impact when I black that eye
Rap aggressor
The god spit agressive content
Due to my jail time and crack sold on the park bench
My right hook'll give you a large dent
On the side of your face for fucking with Clark Kent
Ill shit, son, what the shottie did
Leg broke, Will Smith son The Karate Kid
Embrace your Satan
Evil is good in my hood when paper chasing
This is what happened when Jason
Took moms to the 'tel and they had relations
This'll never be mainstream
They make you sell crack, busts gats and blaze green
Ravishing Ruck Rude
A motherfucking savage who busts tools, P
