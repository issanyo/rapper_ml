[Verse 1: Ian Eubanks]
The bright lights strike gunmetal grey
Surrogate stars reflecting off of the shining vessels
That carry us through the avenues of these vicious circles
Gunmetal grey, and isolation blue
Bright lights, but the darkness sustains
Opening floodgates to the lonely terrain

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
We are so far away from home
Those lights, that fire we follow
The statue watches over the gated city
We break his foundation, but his torch still burns

[Verse 2: Ian Eubanks]
Go, gunmetal grey
Swerving through the circumstances of relentless strain
It's dragging us through the boulevards of consistent pain
Gunmetal grey, and isolation blue
The raging fire sustains

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
We are so far away from home
Those lights, that fire we follow
The statue watches over the gated city
We break his foundation, we cool the fire

[Bridge: Jesse Cash]
Changing evolving what's inside of you
Changing yet essentially the same
If I exhaust repetition, will I wanna stay?
Changing, slowly losing my way

[Pre-Chorus: Ian Eubanks]
Lights city where the demons sustain
We find a home within a lonely terrain

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
We are so far away from home
Those lights, that fire we follow
The statue watches over the gated city
We break his foundation, that light still guides the way
Changing, the light still guides the way
Changing slowly
If I exhaust repetition, will I wanna stay?
Changing, the light still guides the way
Changing, the light still guides the way
