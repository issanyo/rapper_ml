[Verse 1: Sean Price]

We eat fish
Catfish, porgies and mad whities
Real nigga shit my dude, no whities
But the God'll jump on shrimp, lobster tails
When I die Satan moms'll slob my knob in hell
Step with the steel, always got a weapon to kill
Niggas try to jack Jesus, resurrectin' the real
Listen, phenomenon Sean, Ape-Man, King Kong Sean
Cold world, keep your long johns on
Peep the shark tails, how the God's AR spark tales
Slick with it similar to Avon Barksdale
Your arms frail, don't make me pop your knot
Send you to heaven to do a song with Scott La Rock
The best emcee pa, Ruck is the name
Yeah you nice but where the fuck is your chain?
