On your mark. Get set...

[Sean Price]
Jump back, kiss myself
Sean Price used to pump crack, get that wealth
Number one ranking taken, I'mma get that belt
Not a card dealer but deal with the cards that dealt
Yo, I do this for my so fly, so high niggas
African-butt-scratching-bowtie niggas
Ben Vereen/Chicken George, Fiddler On the Roof niggas
Yo, I'm nice but I shoot niggas
Ehh yo, Superfly Snuka jumping from the turnbuckle
Smoking on some shit you never smoked on before, fuck you
Yo, asked a bitch for some brains she said never
Last time I licked your balls caught high blood pressure
Evel Knievel hot wheels jumping like Duke boys (yeeeehaaah!)
Posdnous, Mase and Trugoy (what?)
Plug one in your neck and plug two in your chest
Turn around and plug three in your rest
Yo. Pop clip and then dump; hop, skip and then jump
Backseat of the car, hot chicks in the front
Fuck y'all rappers, all y'all gay
Tryna sell rap and crack - John Forte

TIME! (Time?) Fifty three point seven seconds
(That's kinda fucked up, duke) Aight, it was aight! But, yo
Let's try it again! Ready?! (Ey yo. Hold up, man) GO!

[Sean Price]
My mama ain't raise no fool because my mama ain't raise me, fool
Sean Price the name, your beats hot but your writing is lame
Release shots on the side of your frame
The trees copped now I'm high as a plane
With these cops need a nine in the Range
Your seeds watch while you're high and insane, yo
Bust a u-ey, roll the window down, clutch a toolie
Kill a cop, get away just like a movie
Yo. More or less, nigga, less is more
Half a shirt, half a skirt is how I dress them whores
The Education of Sean Price, turn to page twenty
Learn how Grandma Jean used to make money
Mighty Joe Young, used to gorilla pimp hoes for bread
Can't work her next day, bust her nose and head
Canadian steroids, Ben Johnson cheating to win
Like a fair fight with heat to your chin
Yo, the Fab 5 single came out I got dough
Then the Fab 5 shit got played out I'm like, yo
Lend me a dollar. Duke, what you want me to do
You broke then I'm broke, nigga, I work for you

TIME! One point fifty three seconds! Damn!?!
(Fuck you talking bout?) You outta breath!
You sound like you ran a Ranacanin' on a [?]

[Sean Price]
Yo, I got one hand back in the street
I got the other hand back in the booth (word)
I'm in the crib with the VCR on watching 'Amistad'
Thinking bout a motherfucking cracker to shoot
Pootie Tang niggas always got a lot to say
Ain't talking 'bout shit though, sa-da-tay
Classical soul, I got the nastiest flow
Sean Price, big gun by the grassiest knoll
Can't see me coming like I was fucking a blind bitch
Grabbin the radio and then commence to Gowanus
Leave it alone, or you can bleed from the dome
When I start squeezing the chrome at your Vs and your home
But fuck it (fuck it), y'all wanna die right now
Hit across the face with the nine like blaow
License to kill; fall back Vicodin pills
Get clapped, come back like Christ in the field
Got one foot up in some Tims
Got the other foot up in your ass
(Nigga, it's up in your ass)
You see I'm trying to get ahead, loc, but a nigga dead broke
Now I'm thinking, yo, where the fuck is the cash?!
(Motherfucker)
