[Verse 1: Sean Price]
For life dog I do this shit
Back when Phife Dawg was true Fu-schnick
Invite the fight dog, I do Bruce shit
Polite I'm not pa, I will shoot shit
Da Incredible Rap Team
Is back, my smack's credible, you can ask fiends
L7, I don't bang heaters
The shell'll dead him, veteran gang leader
Aim a .22 blazing
The name is Sean Price from the Zulu nation
No fucks given to a dude who is hating
No Ruck spittin' till the dude's relating
Debating who was the best
He's standing right in front of you and punching your chest
Animal bars
You rambling, I can't stand the amateurs, pa
P!

[Verse 2: Rock]
Slow creeping, speeding at the same time
Intoxicated with a grey nine
Contemplating hate crime
Hate life cause the snake is hiding in plain site
I'm the Don/dawn like the coming of daylight, Rockness!
Royalty, Loyalty all of the above
Dudes I payed tonnes, hold me the glove
All of the thugs, show me all of the love in the world
Probably cause i sold all of them guns
Anyway
I'm a Hop, skip and a jump from a foot in your ass
Youse a hot stripper but you get shook for your cash
Soft
Respeckanize your place in the food chain
Had your little monkey wave til this gorilla monsoon came
I'm God to you lames
Regardless of what you say
You're big brother almighty
Im like Pa from school days
It's a new day, i'm the star of this movie
These anbesol niggas is too fake (tooth ache)
