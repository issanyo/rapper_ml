[Verse One] [Sean Price]:
First of all you bitch niggas actin' all fuckin' silly
Seein', ain't recognizin' how real this rap shit can really be
Fortified, Colt 45 like I'm Billy Dee
Pop you, you, and you for a killer's street trilogy
Sean Price nice with rhymes y'all not feelin' me
Till I slap niggas, now you feelin' me literally
Ayo, it'll be a cold day in Hell
Before you see Ruck, rather see O.J. in a cell
Type that'll run up on your block party
Jump off a dirt bike
Spit physical flames to the crowd, straight hurt mics
Ate the fuck out with this bitch cause her skirt tight
She ain't givin' up the fuckin' pussy, "When you turn dyke?"
Damn, snatched your chain cause I figure it's worth like
2, 3 hundred, gas money, hit the turnpike
Next thing I know helicopters and the searchlight
Damn gotta go, helicopters and the searchlight

[Verse Two] [Agallah]:
Ayo, I beat niggas till they bruise and they bleed with broken arms
Burn niggas
Till I hear the fuckin' sound of smoke alarms
Go to your crib ? the delivery and choke ya moms
I called 9-1-1 before I wrote this song
Killin' niggas, yo I'm doin' somethin' right outta wrong
.45 caliber nigga, yo I tote the long
None of y'all never see me and never do me nada
Jumpin' outta Impalas like niggas wildin' in Guatemala
With gats that holla
Iced out from the wrist the collar
Just image if I sold one of my discs for a dollar
The left hand on my dick, gun on my right
Son in the life, bullets across the street to his fleet
Put up a good fight
Shootouts for about an hour and a half
Alleyway before the L.I.Q. was the only escape path
Shoot through the air, Sha B and son count half
Beat the shit out ya ass
Take your jewels and your stash
We go home to the hood and try to spazz
Got you talkin' all that jazz
And your souls livin' in Alcatraz
I'll out ya ass
Kick bones out ya ass
And they won't know jack shit about ya ass
My flow will lie six feet deep in the grass
