[Verse 1]
A-yo we Mighty Joe Young-ing it, thugging it
Straight from the jungle my brother, my niggas Banana Republic-ing
Rang-a-tang slang, Chewbacca not ragga
Two socks fulla rocks, plus the cops watch us
Yo, we smoke weed, pop pills, drink liquor
Redo the knowledge, read lessons, think quicker
My little niggas saying that the Boot Camp wack
Fuck you paw, you can't rap
Listen let it be known, stepping on rose petals lead to the throne
I'm the motherfucking king, getting head from this ho
In the Who Knew? Estate in Jersey with Jay Williams
Drinking Amstel Light, shooting at clay pigeons
Y'all niggas is straight timid, delicate with the raps
My niggas is spray midgets, elephants on they back
Yo... you kidding me duke
Walk around like that, you ain't strapped, gimme ya loot
(Sean P!) Something like a motherfucking phenomenon
Eat your food at noon, celebrating Ramadan

[Hook]
Big barbarians, baboons with big bucks
Gorillas with gats, nigga Big Ruck -- (AWOO!)
African Apes, stackin them papes
I put some, crack in your steak, don't get slapped in the face -- (AWOO!!)
Orangutan gang banging with that purple flag
Piff-puffing, there's nothing to hurt you bad -- (AWOO!!)
I'm Boot Camp for life, Decept to death
The Force Magnum nigga, never forget -- (AWOO!!)

[Verse 2]
Benjamin Banneker, Afrika Bambaataa
Boom bap bip in your medulla oblongata
You think you nice, but I know somebody hotter
With a crackhead mother and a piece of shit father (Sean P!)
Niggas tryna Free Mumia
I'm unravelling roach clips, tryna free this reefer
Got a Boot Camp hat on, Wu-Wear shirt
Funkmaster Flex Lugz lookin like a fucking jerk
No money, clothes bummy, nose runny
Bent Metrocard, 4-4 blow dummies
Hop on the train in front of the cops
Popping their brain, confronting the cops
Stating the facts, no hating you wack
Throw the 8 to your back then escape with your trap, listen
My niggas is back, you don't believe me though
Playing games and get caught, Coco Levy, yo
Hot peas and butter, cop trees on Sutter
With your not needed mother, yo
I'm one of the best you one of the worst
Gun on your chest blood on your shirt
Son it's berserk, nicca

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Silverback Gorilla nigga baboon raps
Ounce of 'dro, two hoes and a Black Moon track
... lemme get a light man
