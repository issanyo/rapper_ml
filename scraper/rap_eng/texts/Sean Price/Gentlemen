[Intro: Sample]
Over the budget
Gentlemen, we're all players of the game

[Verse 1: Illa Ghee]
I was an Autobot kinda guy, I hated Megatron
Now I drink gin and my best friend's a Decepticon
Some de Ville echelon, sketches over Lebanon
Messagin' the 44 long, iller than King of Kong
Head on the Autobahn
My automatic aims for headshots, devil horns
I'm like the devil's pawn
Group thinker but I'm walkin' all alone
I'm an underground king with a pocket full of stones
Out of order, breathin' underwater, the enforcer
Dick  inside your daughter, takin' selfies with an orca
Oral sex music, shootin' on a cruise ship
Coward niggas talkin' but y'all never do shit
Smokin' dro, rocket fuel and I blast off
I quest love cause my roots is a black thought
I talk lyrics that'll cut you 'til you're under gutters
Illa Ghee and I'm nicer than a mothafucka

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Sket, ten speed, leave stains on a nigga's curb
The best MC, [?] painted a nigga's words
The A-graded great, the 8 holder
Make soldiers shit on theyself, the game over
Clap a gat, clapping back battle rap stats
Forgot about the ? then have a nap
I blast the Magnum gun loudly
With very great honor, I'm the magna cum laude
Cop a squat, they sippin' hot latte
Get money, big dummy, somethin' Lamont' Pops say
Bout to let actions speak more than words
Weaksauce disturbed
The whole crew you got is losers
See-through tube socks, new, sock it to yah
Crews poppin' Rugers
New soccer shoes, watch the dude, watch the dude
That's watchin' 2Pac in Cuba
[?], Judo maneuvers
Shittin' all in your bloomers, P

[Verse 3: Lil' Fame]
Burn, another body on the iron
Got the hood behind me, keep it grimy when I rhyme
Driver seat recline, rollin' in the fishbowl
No chrome, no tints, blow through with your bitch
Big dog, I'm like a St. Bernard
You 'bout as small as a Maltese, barkin' on a short leash
You gon' get the party shot, get your ass mollywhopped
Somebody call the janitor, we gon' need this lobby mopped
Marksman regime, certified beast mode
Personify street code, get your life repo'd
Drive through funeral, come back and scoop you up
With you in back of the hearse, your hearse on back of the truck
Give a fuck, you can catch me with the crew or dolo
[?] with it, nigga, [?]
It's fizz, woah, Mac, double OG
Marksman, M.O.P.s, nigga
