[STARVIN B Verse: 1]
Again species spirit feces
On the doorhandle and DT's
You spit wit emcees but you can't see these
The weaponry selected depended on was a threat to me
The epiphany the activity was in my destiny refreshingly
We speak harm was all in the skeptically
The dude can't reproduce 'cuz of self was inflicted with insects in me
You never seen a man hop out a black van
Go after the cameraman put hands a glass in a bandana
Let the fall lands on a man and the appearance
Imma stand and panhandle the land of my lyrics
Champion spirit stands on a champion sweater
Starring Timberland and a star-born Italian leather
Sadly that I never get the dots to connect
Your fossils get pressed
And it turns into a hospital bed
Rock till I'm dead I made it on live on-set
The shit we got on debt comes a biological threats, check

[Starvin B Hook:]
Style wild cow stow psych boy tuberculosis
Air trap wrapped of symptoms of narcoses
Turn it up louder I needed a higher dosage
Biological threats are so sick

[Skanks Verse: 2]
My new catch is I smacked that shit out of Ratchet did
Like that big man did on the X-ray on the eight ball check you did
I don't see all the racket is of Kim Kardashian
Closer make it like acting you did
Posting like you don't know how to acid spit
Enough about that bitch right it's all about stench he did
How about hitting that rap king bring that crown back for bid
We will win in the end
When we're on stage and set and it's more like Brooklyn we aught in did it again
Hey nigga I'm sick with 'em pens I bleed boredom spit vicious intense
This is harder then it gets it's Skanks
You bet you check my rights nigga I'm a general and to tell the truth
I got new young recruits I'll love to get right at you
I'm highly trained in a new way brother we're not the same
It's not a game no luck surviving stupid still
