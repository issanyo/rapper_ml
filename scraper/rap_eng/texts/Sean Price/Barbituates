[Hook: Sean Price]
Flawed vision
Bitching over my bar, Pa that you can get
You fucked up so partake in barbituates

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Yo
P popular, pop pellets repeatedly
Non stop shots at ya
Criminal type elevate at the cemetary
Not one of them niggas that's celebrated in February
Legendary lines, the flow is classic
Erybody in the borough know that shit
That's it, P, rap death expect murder
I snap necks for checks and requests from Hex Murda
Ill raps that control the scene
Dirty nigga turn the milk bath to Ovaltine
P, definite dumb
Blind to the ways of my rhyme with the vest and the gun
Showdown I have arrived
Ya'll niggas slide off stage
Mow down ya twenty-five ya

[Verse 2: Labba]
Time to rob off the Glock
Corporate ties could bring back stocks
We like Moses, we bring forward flocks
Corporate ties could buy by blocks
Wake up in the morning, put the pigeons in the pot
Phone ringing, that's forty days locked
OGs respect our hustle
Only the poor shall suffer
I made my money in the fucking bundles
Nigga we don't eat steak
But homey you could have a wake
This fucking fat nigga got grit
Motherfucker we the shit
Fuck a deal, I'll have a meal with the prince
I'm like Xerxes when I spit
Mandible is back, back, back, back
The ruler is back, back, back, back
The rulers is back, back, back, back
The rulers is back, back, back, back

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sean Price, RIM]
Best skills, the flow hard
A much needed change, Steph Mills with a nose job

Bardiculous, you can get celebrate with these raps
The flow is intact, ya'll sound like you spitting in scat
Who can duck the train of thought for these wack raps, I'm back
For moving money 'round like Nasdaq in black
Push a button when reciting my text
On you Shay Pat rappers like hex
With random acts of death
In the two three when I green seat new weed
But stay around tree like a holiday wreath
Rudeness bring rude fists
Only push clips if stakes high like Ruth Chris
I feel the hate coming from all ends
Niggas praying on my downfall like a rain dance
It's all G, no bad breath but voice he
My mode on the bottom lock homey, I'm low key, better be
On your best when you talk about my team though
Run down, come press a nigga like a kilo

[Verse 4: Illa Ghee]
Dodge them bullets when I'm sleeping
Wolf nigga, I'm teething
Clap you back to life then I stab you while you dreaming
Rap fatal putting spikes in your baby's cradle
Threaten life and put the antichrist inside your navel
Illa raps is like Aids with the flu street approval
I speak in purple haze burning blue grenades made to shoot
This is voodoo
Vanilla Ice claiming that he Zulu
A billionaire eating ramen noodles
Through kindness, I'm spazzin' on the wild and the spineless
My educated thoughts are mindless
Mind your business
Eighty crimes in one sentence
Repeat offenders, repeated shot sender
Tackle the hot winter
The worm inside the apple center
Apple eye, now hit enter
The foulest show Illa's verbal agenda
Bars'll have you drunker than the bartender
You rappers food and I'm eating dinner

[Hook]
