[Verse 1: Sean Price]
It go, nice rap and Mic Tyson fans, no
Tight fashion, might jack sedans
Dancing machine
Adamantium rapping regime
The shit you holding is dead colon cancer the cream
The slugs move everything around me, S.M.E.A.M
Huh? What the fuck that mean?
Kick over the kids stroller nigga Ruck that mean
Mean Gene Okerlund spoken the word of Kareem
So sacrilegious with the word rhyme gestures
Sold crack to bitches in their third trimester
You know how it go
You know my flow dope ala Héctor Lavoe
Never catch P on the girl song
I smack shit out your "We Are the World" song
Get a hater scary
My defense intense Refrigerator Perry

[Chorus: Rock]
You gonna make me kill a hater, P [not you]
We gonna get’em a little later, P [got’eeem]
Hit’em with that widow maker, P [uh huh, uh huh, uh huh]
It’s my nigga, Refrigerator Perry

{DJ Revolution *scratches*}
Fuck around with P and get yo whole shit bent
I’m machine gun slappin’, that’s what happen
Attack you like a linebacker
Bustin’ yo shit
Sean Price
Knock out yo fuckin’ lights!

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Yo
Shot somebody fam, clapped the nine
Lock my body, can't trap my mind
Raps divine father, father divine I
Conversate with the congregation that's relating with mine
You new to the one, two
Can't escape your fate
Great who can I run to?
True, words of nerds don't hurt me
Half man half machine, the team's Murphy (Murphy, its you)
On and on 'til the break of dawn
Making Shaun mad she like, "Dad fuck making songs"
Nigga the gun out
Gun pop and one cops say, "nigga done gummed out"
Get a hater scary
My defense intense, Refrigerator Perry

{DJ Revolution *scratches*}
Attack you like a linebacker
Bustin’ yo shit, makin’ you bleed
Sean Price
Knock out yo fuckin’ lights!

[Chorus: Rock]
Whoo
You gonna make me kill a hater, P [not you]
We gonna get’em a little later, P [got’eeem]
Hit’em with that widow maker, P [uh huh, uh huh, uh huh]
It’s my nigga, Refrigerator Perry

{DJ Revolution *scratches*}
Fuck around with P and get yo whole shit bent
I’m machine gun slappin', that’s what happen
Attack you like a linebacker
Bustin’ yo shit
Sean Price
Knock out yo fuckin’ lights!
Attack you like a linebacker
Bustin’ yo shit, Bustin’ yo, Bustin’ yo, yo, shit
Attack you like a linebacker
Bustin’ yo shit, Bustin’, Bustin’ yo, yo shit
Attack you like a linebacker
Bustin’ yo shit, Bustin’ yo, Bustin’ yo, yo, shit
Attack you like a linebacker
Bustin’ yo shit, Bustin’, Bustin’ yo, yo, shit
Attack you like a linebacker
