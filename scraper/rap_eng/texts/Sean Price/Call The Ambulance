[Verse 1: Sean Price]
A-yo stop with the bullshit
Playing game niggas, hopskotch when the tool click
Don't make me pop ya
Ya black eye, blue, bitch, Frank Sinatra
You see SP, you'll be thinking rasta
Think it's peace & love, but I think to drop ya
Fake gangsta rappers, got ya thinking mobster
It's a fact, you're an actor, thinkin' Oscar's, yo
Slap this jerk
Take his Jesus piece, send him back to Catholic church
Niggas actin' like my motherfuckin' gat don't work
Til you hit and then collapse in the dirt, and screamin', "that shit hurt"
Motherfuckin' right, that shit hurt
Niggas play tackle football with a plastic Nerf
Bitches with dreadlocks and drapes on they back
Suck dick, plus they make biscuits from scratch

[Break]
Call the ambulance nigga
PF Cuttin'
Here we go
Nah mean, all my black people listen

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Benjamin Banneker, Afrika Bambaataa
Boom bap bip in your medulla oblongata
You think you nice, but I know somebody hotter
With a crackhead mother and a piece of shit father (Sean P!)
Niggas tryna free Mumia
I'm unravelling roach clips, tryna free this reefer
Got a Boot Camp hat on, Wu-Wear shirt
Funkmaster Flex Lugz looking like a fucking jerk
No money, clothes bummy, nose runny
Bent Metrocard, 44 blow dummies
Hop on the train in front of the cops
Popping their brain, confronting the cops
I'm just stating the facts, no hating you wack
Throw the 8 to your back then escape with your trap, listen
My niggas is back, you don't believe me though
Keep playing games and get caught, Coco Levy, yo
Hot peas and butter, cop trees on Sutter
Caught your cypher drinking with you knock kneeded mother, pause
One of the best you one of the worst
Gun on your chest blood on your shirt
Son is berserk, nigga

[Verse 3: Sean Price]
Pardon me Holmes
It was a unsolved mystery, Barnaby Jones
Yo the time on the clock was a quarter to three
Had two four-fives like a quarter to three
Niggas said the bitch doofy but she shorter than me
Heltah Skeltah

[Outro]
Ayo let me start my saying
I'm Sean Price motherfucker I ain't playing
