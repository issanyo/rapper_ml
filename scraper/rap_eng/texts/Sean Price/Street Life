[Scratch Chorus]:
"The street life is the only life I know" - Carlton Fisk

[Verse One] [Sha Stimuli]:
Look
Everybody's calling my name, I feel like I'm famous
But a lot of haters waiting and praying to see the day I flop
Fuck it, I am steadily gaining, shining and raining/reigning at the same time
Come at me flagrant and I will aim and pop
Can't nobody say what I'm saying the way I say it
I'm the greatest music maker with paper, I used to play the block
Coming up with phrases so flaming the booth was blazing
That's not a phase, I got the ladies still chasing me because I make 'em hot
Now you wanna take my spot, make me stop
Take your top off with convertable burners, I got the stainless cocked
To jump offsides is a false start
But me? Holding back is the hard part
Stupid ass
How could I not be an allstar when I'm moving more product than Wal-Mart?
Is all heart, gold cart flow, tote iron, yell "fore!"
Hit birdies, never go off course, I spit raw
Stimuli bitch

[Verse Two] [Cymarshall Law]:
I'm that shit
I'll black quick, watch the man rip
While these pussy MC's be getting high off of catnip
I can't quit
Light a rapper up like a match stick
I'm that sick
If you hating you can eat a fat dick
I'm killing ever last bit
Like no other my brother, I'm the illest motherfucker that can spit
Never drop dead sick cause I'm on a track like an AM kit
I can write a rhyme, line quoted in Sanskrit
And I always got a bad chick that's mad thick
Twisting the next spliff while I'm working on my last hit
Overflowing with dopeness, not all of it can fit
Born in the U.K. and I am Slick like the man Rick
No gold chain, my foe's lame, I throw flame
In my own lane, I'm the number one draft pick
And I'm holding all the cards like Mavrick
Cymarshall Law and I'm out like "that's it"

[Verse Three] [Sean Price]:
Gunplay, knife work, muay tigh kicks
Elbow, knee strike, more fly shit
E pills, mushrooms, more white shit
You on the phone telling dawg, you are Mike Vic
I might beat shit outta nigga like this
I might creep, click, on a nigga like this
I'm alright with the cross, duke I'm out with the ?
This is jehad, the house of Sadaam
Nigga, I got a flare pistol
Everlast, outerwear, Vladamir Drisko
I'm rough sex, y'all niggas soft porn
I bust heads when y'all niggas was just born
Understand the vet is the best
Turn powder into rock without a chemistry set
I can wake up broke and be stacked by bedtime
Shake up folks that ain't smoking, it's led time
P!
