[Verse 1]
You don't stop
Selling your bullshit on the corner they won't cop
Type of dude that's supplying the block
And I come home quick qualified for shock
Block official, popping the pop, I pop a pistol
The rest in peace t-shirts, the rest of the block forget you
Magilla, Mandela the boast
Bum shit, gun shit, panhandle with toast
Dumb fuck tried to go to Virginia with dope
Got shot by New York niggas in Virginia with dope
P, remember me folks
This time next year I'mma remember who don't
Sean Price, niggas thinking I'm the GOAT
Premeditated
But soon comes, son, the nigga is dedicated
Came my one way and started this switch
Now you formally known as the artist I call bitch
P!
