[Hook: Pharaohe Monch]
Nigga, when they see him they say that's that nigga
His last name should be that's that nigga
Sound kinda nice, that's that nigga
Never catch him with them plastic half-ass niggas
When you hear it you should hashtag niggas
Since birth, a little bastard-ass nigga
White people do not recite the chorus
If you do we'll wash your mouth with Lavoris nigga

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Listen, and the boy better
I do it for real, you acting Andrew Lloyd Webber
Real McCoy leather from the back of the cow ass
The culture power will kill you, fuck it the four blast
I said the same thing twice
Telephone gun, my nigga the thing ring twice
You a cock diesel, nigga extra ginseng type
I'm a pop eagle, nigga when the thing ring Price
Sean is the first name
Fifth fire first, motherfucker, the first flame
Earthlings leave their face in the street
You pick up your face and wait for police
But the father do floss
I make your mom suck my dick with barbecue sauce

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Bafa shiki
Four fifth knocking you, rocking you, Dahved Levy
Pop your beanie for rocking a hot bikini
Transgender, blam-blam leaving your man injured
You perpetrating a fraud, penetrating a Floyd
Wild dance moves, you be demonstrating on boys
Two slaps and I'm deadin' you
Give a nigga a lesson on how to catch a predator
Nigga, I'm a wild on every
Nigga crossdressing, the essence of Tyler Perry
Fucking can-can dancing, blam blam and son
Shucking and jiving, man-tan advancing
I show no love
Bozo thugs when you throw those duds
I ain't believing in y'all
Make your mom suck my dick with blue cheese on my balls, P

[Hook]
