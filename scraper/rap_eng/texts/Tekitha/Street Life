[Chorus: Tekitha]
Street life, is the only life I know
Street life, where we got no place to go
Street life, where we struggle just to eat
Street life, where the drugs and thugs meet

[Verse 1: La the Darkman]
Yo, I bust shots out Glocks with kids that push rocks
Hold Glocks, run in spots with cheese like Fort Knox
Rhyme excellent dealing with intelligence
Get money like embezzlement, brilliant as the President
La the Dark comet, inherited nature, Islamic
Stay loyal to my Clan like Elijah Muhammad
That's a promise, creating them secrets be like a Mason
Every time I touch the track I swing my axe at Satan
Speed racing through life world class
La let the tech splash, my lyrics hard as brass
Yo, I'm all-star, check me in the Source y'all
'98 sports car purchase me a sports bar
Dun, I run with smart men, accurate, sharpshooter, marksman
Running through New York campaigning like Al Sharpton
And sing, my guns be black as Shabba Ranks
Computerized thugs dropping checks in the bank in this...

[Chorus: Tekitha]
Street life, is the only life I know
Street life, where we got no place to go
Street life, where we struggle just to eat
Street life, where the drugs and thugs meet

[Verse 2: La the Darkman]
You on my dick, my life is like a James Bond flick
Mad bitches, mad bullets but I never get hit
Yo, from herpes to trees, TVs and MPVs
Niggas in jail for life that's strong as Hercules
From Bloods to Latin Kings, the Bronx back to Queens
Drugs to dope fiends, green Rovers to limousine
Prostitutes 14, sucking dick on porno screens
Vaginas that's unclean clean with terrible hygiene
Describing my block scene is devils at Halloween
The young son got guns with 50 shot magazine
And digital red beams, getting drunk off gasoline
Robbing niggas marked, died for his chain and his cream in this...

[Chorus: Tekitha]
Street life, is the only life I know
Street life, where we got no place to go
Street life, where we struggle just to eat
Street life, where the drugs and thugs meet

[Verse 3: La the Darkman]
I'm unstoppable, rainbow garment stay tropical
Jewels stay rockable, crystal clear optical
My niggas got bodies get watched like John Gotti
In a mansion with a monk learning Wu-Tang karate
It's a fortress niggas can't afford this
My queens look gorgeous, I think eating swordfish
Surrounded by 20 men coldblooded as an amphibian
In the Benz puffing trees straight from the Caribbean
It's Darkman, fuck..

[Chorus: Tekitha]
Street life, is the only life I know
Street life, where we got no place to go
Street life, where we struggle just to eat
Street life, where the drugs and thugs meet

[Outro]
Cash, I love cash kid
Better love it
Root of all evil
I love it dough, it's all good
