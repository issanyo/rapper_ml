[Intro: Hell Razah]
You're not promised tomorrow
(You know what I'm saying)
We are living by the bottle
(The pages of life turn every day)
Be careful what you follow
(Word up, check this one)

[Verse 1: Hell Razah]
Guns, clips, carried by cliques, eighty six
Same shit nine six the old and young switch
Poor verses rich, wars and conflicts hit
Politics get rich off the Bloods and the Crips
Slaves shoot slaves, modern day Egypt
Brooklyn convicts is conned to be vic'd
Harassed by the cops from up the block precinct
Fugitives forever they choose to live together
Scheme to get cheddar from anybody living better
However, the money getters follow trend setters
Wit black 9 Berettas now they writing jail letters
Government give us guns so we go and kill each other
Handmade drugs destroy our sisters and our brothers
Some turn thieves defeat their seeds and their mothers
Undercover cops under the cover sell Glocks
A free box of shell if you miss any shots
Crack spots and hell only stops burn cells
Pale horses, evil forces, crime bosses
Weak mind double-crossers cause mic forces

[Verse 2: 60 Second Assassin]
If it don't fit don't force it
Can't mix the nine wit the Caucus
Picture the ocean without the saltness
Killas without the forfeit
There's no time without me sixty be the last sec you'll see
Another chance to breathe so save it for some ease
Cause it be a lot of y'all taking in war with no grease
I never seen a time to be so easy for a real O.G
Can't forget Ol' D, 60 Sec back on the set killing spree
It's been a long time
No here from, check it for the well elected
Fans know I'm blessed (power moves) yo, come and fear some
Those with an ear let em hear something
No more light for a fake to live none
Here's one, careers done, here come
The analytical, political, non-superstitial
Biochemical blast the earth by storm words I bomb
For Korans holy Bible, the archer rival
The coming of the Noahs, Mahadis, Messiahs
The street vibers, the burning of all MC's by the fire
The great instead of poles up for hire
The Putnam Avenue shotgun
Up they do run run run they do run run
Now my niggas around the way F.A. rock
To the far rock run sews up the block
Full of bums, get up the sucker trapped
This ain't Halloween take off the mask
Lot of chumps faking jacks
Anty up the money put it in the pot
I wanna see all this trife
Or are niggas gonna get blast fast
No hesitation cause I'm on probation
Niggas think I got loot to be taken
I'm in for the making
Mouthpiece retained so there'll be no vacation
Warning warning a word for the snaking

[Chorus: Hell Razah & Tekitha]
You're not promised tomorrow
(Word up yo, people dying everyday)
We are living in a bottle
(Drugs and gun play)
Be careful what you follow
(Open your eyes kid)
We got four individuals
Each member come together just drop a jewel {repeat sung}

[Verse 3: Prodigal Sunn]
It was my third day in Supreme court, accused as a murder suspect
Caught me blazing wit Tomalin in Guana projects
A young fugitive soldier but still sober ill
Over the hill still, punch a cobra in his grill
Snitches and bitches I reveal, soon to make the devil kneel
Writing his will for what, for how he got a sway pill
That'll be the day that my skills enhance
Strengthen my stance no longer taking the world by chance
Only got one life to live, so I create, make, then give
Keep it active rolling massive intelligent
As the days went blood stains still remain on the pavements
Spear razor sharp, another adolescent shot
Corrupted cops, yo this shit gotta stop

[Outro: Prodigal Sunn]
Word up man, shit gotta stop man
(You're not promised tomorrow)
Niggas is dying everyday
(We are living in a bottle)
When are you going to realize man
This shit is for real out here man
Word up man niggas got to keep their eyes open man
Keep your head above water
(Be careful what you follow)
Because you know why man?
We all we got
Thats my word man
Y'all niggas don't realize it man
We all gon burn in the motherfucking fire man
Thats word up man
Peace to all my brethrens
