It's been so long
Since he had a true friend
True friends are sure hard to come by

But then again
His loyalties lie within
Always kept his head to the sky
And they can't see, no, no, no

They can't see him walking through the darkness, no, no, no, no
They can't see him walking through the darkness
No, no, no, no, no
They can't see him walking through the darkness
No, no
They can't see him walking through, walking through

Day after day
And night after night
He's hustling just to get it right
There's no honor from thieves
No war without peace

The noose is tight, he'll still survive
Because they can't see, no
They can't see him walking through the darkness
No, no
They can't see him walking through the darkness
No, no
They can't see him walking through the darkness
They can't see him walking through, walking through

No, in the end
Fate had it's place
On his road to become, becoming

They chased and gave haste
With zeal to a lemonade
Challenge instead of grace
And sealed his fate

They can't see him walking through the darkness
No, no
They can't see him walking through, walking through
No
They can't see him walking through, walking through
Walking through

Walking through the darkness
Walking through the darkness
Walking through the darkness
