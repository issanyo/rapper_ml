[Intro: Cappadonna]
Ahh... the outdoors, the fresh outdoors
Word up, it's a beautiful day
Bout to go poli' right now that's my word
Aiyyo

[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
Aiyyo call me a cab it's the Razor Sharp kid
Dipped everyday my style is po-lit'
I'm out to the Mansion I gots to catch Ghost
I'm headed to the club tonight, we need toast
For that wack ass MC, talking all the shit
I know we can't wait just to get his wig split
It's war with the Gods this year, represent
The bitch-ass niggas keep trying to repent
But we still licking off, we wild like 2 Cent
Park Hill Projects, say it with your lungs
Fuck y'all cats, we always got guns
But just in case, we get drunk and can't drive
We gotta fuck something up
Dead or alive y'all coming with us
We live on the other side of the chart
Where your mother met Poppa Wu

[Chorus: Tekitha]
Black boy, in the ghetto streets
Black boy, no more suffering
Black boy, shine the light for we
Continue, black boy, black boy, black boy, black boy

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
After the tour I came back for more
Coming correctly, just like before
Wu-Tang Forever, I was just a pirate
In the rec room regulating with Osirus
Deep thoughts, I don't take no shorts
Minds on lease like expensive imports
Elevate the seed, no lust or greed
Living life long time may continue to breed
Never getting caught up inside the agencies
For ten long years, but I paid my fee
Now I'm on the frontline with W.T.C
Back me down these streets are still ill
From Brownsville all the way down in Park Hill
Pack with the beef cause niggas won't chill
Cats smoked out like chicken on the grill
I'm taking this shit way back to Bill Bill
In the projects where my man got killed

[Chorus: Tekitha]
Black boy, in the ghetto streets
Black boy, no more suffering
Black boy, shine the light for we
Continue, black boy, black boy, black boy, black boy

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Donna Camay, rocking with y'all all night
Used to be a little stressed now I'm getting it right
Fresh kicks with the gold watch dipped in ice
From Shaolin, it's the vanglorious man
When the world go around these things start to happen
Wifey in the kitchen, brother still snitching
Bloods accumulating, we getting impatient
Knowledge and Wisdom, teach the understanding
That's how I'm planning, blow up like a cannon
Pull my man in, hit y'all again
Now I make sense, we do this for the rent
Build with intelligence break your defense
No hesitation, time gets spent
Some fall victim, others get bent
Some recognize, real niggas represent
I can't never stop til my heart is content
Putting in the work til I feel confidant
Blast out darts in the Wu basement

[Chorus: Tekitha] (x2)
Black boy, in the ghetto streets
Black boy, no more suffering
Black boy, shine the light for we
Continue, black boy, black boy, black boy, black boy

[Outro: kung-fu movie sample]
Hahahahahahahaha
Don't you know the underworld?
There's no friendship party here
No meeting
You can come, but you can't leave
Move! Let no one live..
*sounds of fighting*
