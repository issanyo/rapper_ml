Yo yo confused but yet wise my problem surrounds me, a lot of things upset me, as my soul rejects me
Enemy of self physical.....listen, let me tell you about..
Yo yo confused but yet wise my problem surrounds me
A lot of things upset me as my soul rejects me
Enemy of self physically enslaved
By the luxuries of this world so I behave
Like a man inside the grave
Who's life is lost
I want the promised gold but can't afford the cost
Or could I, I know the prescribed laws
Any effect is a result of the cause
Of lies and delusions to myself I have lied
Burning inside wanting to open wide
And scream
The name of the supreme
But I'm trapped in this world
Lusting for girls
Therefore I imagine a genie and a wish
And searching for things that just does not exist
But in the midst there's the answer for which I have searched
Cause from me springs divine prince rakeem
And that is me the master of equality
With the ability
To set myself free
But b.o.b.b.y
He don't want to die
He don't want to die he don't want to try
So I'm forced to cry
And get trapped up for living my life inside a lie
These problems surround me
A lot of things upset me
As my soul rejects me
Enemy of my self physically enslaved
By the luxuries of this world so I behave
Like a man inside the grave
Who's life is lost
I want the promised gold but I can't afford the cost
Or could I, I heard of the prescribed laws
Any effect is a result of the cause
Of lies and delusions to myself I have lied
Burning inside and wanting to open wide
And scream
The name of the supreme
But I'm trapped in this world
I'm lusting for girls
Before I imagined a genie and a wish
And I'm searching for things that does not exist
But in my midst there's the answer
For which I have searched
Cause from me springs the divine prince rakheem
And that is me the master of equality
Give myself the opportunity
And set free and be all I can be
Be all I can be
And not a nigga just trapped up in luxury

Yo bobby digitial got to get knowledge of his self right now
As we go through the struggle of life we got to go from boy to man
We start off as sperm to baby baby to man from man to dead man
And from dead man back to sand
All praises due to allah the most high word up
I got to be free I got to be free I got to break free
I got to break free I got to break free I got to break.....
