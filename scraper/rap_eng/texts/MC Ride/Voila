[Hook]
My propa-voila-shadow-ganda
My shadow stigmata offer
Left right up, step right up
Get your crisis, why bother
Quack like priest, win five dollar
Melanin pewter cellophane
Arms long as their legs
Even the greys can't oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Voila

[Refrain]
Voila

[Verse 1]
Maybe I belong to you
I'm sure you want me to
My shadow's on to you
Voila-voila
I can't make you like voila
I'll make you love voila
Make you make love to voila holes
Make you replace your faith with voila, hotel
New necklace, new temple, new help, help

[Pre-Hook]
I don't talk to the help, help
Who's voila suits who too well
Don't talk to the help, help
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
It's your lucky day, my shadow bernays voila
Aren't you lucky, fuck my shadow gush voila
You're a lucky spin, my shadow spam voila
My shadow slither, my shadow whisper voila
Live in my shadow while you wait to gasp in space
Gasp in my shadow like everything that lives
My shadow incubate everything that is
My shadow cast voila through every one of its kids

[Pre-Hook]
I don't talk to the help, help
Who's voila suits who too well
Don't talk to the help, help
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
