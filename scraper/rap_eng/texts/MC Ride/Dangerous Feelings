{G Rider}
Eager my alarm, stranger to disarm
Rangers of harm [?]
Pain in my [?] arm
Shame from my karma
Barage three charge
Reversel entrepage
Rehearsel in garage
Blunts in cars, starin' at the stars
Hitting what i cough
Gotta starve just to stay high, i'm [parked?]

{Stefan Burnett}
This one's for the freaks
Who get fucked up seven days a week
Nut up and try not to speak
While i touch the mic with all this heat
Up all night ridin' beats
Use to down crazy horse and walk the streets
With no remorse, can't feel my feet
Smokin' shorts like fat people eat
Obsessive-compulsive
They trip [? over-zest] by the coldness
They quiver but i try not to notice
Deliver me a motive and i'll do it for no reason
Blew it back like the season
You can't patch where i need one
I'll hit you back if i see some

{Swank Daddy}
Dangerous feelings entered our passions
Carved out a prayer, you got to be faster
If you felt the day, niggas [?] fashion
Molested this may [and?] this dirty ration
Forget it and [cruise save?] my love from subtraction
No one in the car, heavy loads are lastin'
Thnak god for the scars cause she move like saturn
Feel good when the harness stronger than attraction
Can't really miss the bitch, we celebrated birth
She made the dirt look so rich
On glass roads figure-eightin', hollerin' [?] bitch
See life as a tear drop
When we reminisce, fuck what this here [got?]
I've been hung by the trip, shakin' from a neverland
Soldier hand me a stick
You gotta love the way we're losing our grips
[?] right off the cycle, nigga [hits the switch?]
