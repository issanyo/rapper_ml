[Chorus]
Ass
(x16)

[Verse 1]
Shake that booty like it's fat
I'll get in before the last
(x2)

[Chorus]
Ass
(x8)

[Verse 2]
Shake that booty like it's fat
I'll get in before the last
Please don't let my whole time pass
Yeah, you know I'm really lovin' that

[Chorus]
Ass
(x8)

[Verse 3]
Just let that booty jiggle
And let it all wiggle
(x4)

[Chorus]
Ass
(x8)

[Verse 4]
Shake that booty like it's fat
I'll get in before the last
Please don't let my whole time pass
Yeah, you know I'm really lovin' that

[Chorus]
Ass
(x16)
