[Verse 1: G Rider]
Release this telekinesis
Thrill cease to exist
Hidin' scars on my wrist
[abidin'?] stars till [my ?]
Ride in cars and smokin' spliffs
[?] parts and [?]
Providin' smarts, provokin' shifts of energy fields
When we yield
Wonder who's the savior if the lord is my shield
Truth revealed, though it's hardly ever [smokin'?]
Thank jah, allah, god, krishna, Buddhist, shiva, and the spirit makin' beats and chokin'
[plus?] i'm hustlin' tokens
At times i [noid?], on the road, in my ride, on the ground [promotin'?]
[raise her?] for a while, relax my mind
Wax the shine
We find treasures within when we rewind
Make the earth seem foolish
[weary?] of a kind to want to rule this
Schools of fish getting tortured by a sonar
Television '98, thought donor

[Verse 2: Mxlpix (MC Ride)]
Just another crazy mystic getting sick with the wailing [wistic?]
Makes rhythm cryptic, painting poetic lipstick
Cross the faces of critics in the way
Lost my place and didn't know what to say
Till my ace picked up the bass and began to play
Wicked hits laced like andy flippin' weight
Along the interstate
A little before 8 in the mornin'
Just after you ate, what that [whore ?]
Then you called a date
Cooked to try and keep you comin' back
Lookin' like a freak but you knew that
Took a week to remember where you met her at
Thinkin' you surrendered to that fat
[? forever club?]
Next thing you know your naked in the tub
Beggin' like a crack fien to rub
On the [giant?] chest, your life's a mess

[Verse 3: Swank]
You say it's way past 12, feel like it's 9
Gettin' warm in hell baby lost ya mind
While I was drivin', fell asleep gazin' at a sign
Me and my homeboy here to wrinkle in time
Dancin' in the moonlight, [be real, lendin'?] blind
I hope my experience ain't a crime
It seem like my reason don't never rhyme
I see the women but pass me the wine
Can't wait the mintues, you know I fill the times
Let's make the moment cuz it's one of a kind
[bindin'?] the broken, below or behind
But mary the ego is fine, i'm gone
Way before your people resign, i'm gone
Way before your people resign, i'm gone
