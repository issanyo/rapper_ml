[Intro]
People are tryin' to hear what I'm sayin'

[Verse 1]
Both ends of my candle countin' paces
Never stop chasing each other's faces
I'm the mask that separates them
Bridge their sole desire's cravin'
Don't make me take my face off
Show you why I hate soft
Let flock of sheep get shaved off
Lynched by their halos

[Hook]
Call me crazy, but I swear my line's been tapped
In my glass house prepared for surprise attack
Realized I held the blade inside my back
Omega megalomaniac
In my glass house prepared for surprise attack
Realized I held the blade inside my back

[Verse 2]
I'm the coat hanger in your man's vagina
Manic downstroke on fire
Beat it, bitch, all black, can't fade it
Beat it, bitch, all black, can't fade it
Beat it, bitch, I came to brang it
Fuck bourgeois, ODB raw
Your pearl white teeth, my Yellowman jaw
Say only what you think I know you should
Hate myself more than you ever could

[Hook]
Call me crazy, but I swear my line's been tapped
In my glass house prepared for surprise attack
Realized I held the blade inside my back
Omega megalomaniac
In my glass house prepared for surprise attack
Realized I held the blade inside my back
