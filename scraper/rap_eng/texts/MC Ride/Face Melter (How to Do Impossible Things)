[Intro]
Face melter
Cock the barrel, trigger range
Swerving donuts 'gainst the grain
I blame ghost rider, whips the brain
Kaleidoscopic bullet train
Never gave up, just a clutch
Bitch

[Verse 1]
Burn a bitch and burn that strip to dust
Dust to ashes, ash to mush
Mashed off the madness man, combust
Black magic flames race out because they forgot they can't get down enough
Low to the ground limbo, don't touch this merchandise, it's way too much
Ride the currents like a snake, wicked rhymes
Whirlpools I'll wade through haters, posers, fools, and flakes
Through this breaks the rules it takes
But I not just bump what you waste your time and money tryin' to chase

[Hook]
Don't know why you're wasting time, just know what I do with mine
How to do impossible things
How to do impossible things
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream
(Madness)

[Verse 2]
Don't trip man, just know we come
And won't even be close to done
Till shit hit the fan and make that flesh melt off your plastic face
Kill it till it dies, don't stop it until you feel that flatline drop
To hell and back, fuck yeah, why not?
(Why not?)
Smash till I break out, can't stop, won't stop, don't stop
Ghosts can't get caught, run it back, get cracked to the beat one time
Get-get-get back, keep in sync rhymes
Endorphins cashed by your own time
I'm coughing, the track freeze and unwind
Weed is of kind vaporize, freak man down from way this rides, how this rides
Feet don't touch the ground inside, I twist the rhythm pounds 'em on
How measurements of sound rewind
Forever and a day forgot
Forget to let it bang and walk the plank that hang from slang concocted to destroy the frame got bent by globe
This takes the pain in shock
(Ahh!)

[Hook]
Don't know why you're wasting time, just know what I do with mine
How to do impossible things
How to do impossible things
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream

[Verse 3]
Execution makes it hot, electrocute the wave, the shock
To the brains of heads that came to watch us claim the game haters can't knock us
Real ones bring that bloody bass, we came to melt your fucking face
You can keep it, I don’t want it
Back, my only inside pocket
All up on it, man get off it
Can’t you see me? Best to drop it
Cut it, quit it, quick, next topic
How we fuck it off and rock it
Paradox knot, disco sock it
Can't unplug it with your logic
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
Fuck it
And unplug it with your -
Take out your eyes and watch it
Make you cry, feel like I lost it
Didn’t lose it, never had it
Just another clueless faggot
Bound and gagged by fear
Too pathetic to be tragic
Get that shit outta here

[Hook]
Don’t know why you waste your time, just know what I do with mine
How to do impossible things
How to do impossible things
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream

[Verse 4]
I can’t deny I’ve not the slightest idea why
Even attempt to try
See them sigh
And settle with knowing barely enough to get by
Automatic supernova, so what? (Automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic)
We’ll storm in the gates, subatomic
Flame drippin' onto this coal, setting hellfire to your face

[Outro]
Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter
