[Intro]
Tak-kyon, Tak-kyon
Tak-kyon, Tak-
Triple six, five, forked tongue

[Verse 1]
Subatomic penetration, rapid fire through your skull
How I shot it on one takin' it back to the days of tryna lose control
Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones

[Hook]
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that’s tight, what it's like to experience - Takyon

[Verse 2]
Out of the blue, in through the back
Door coming through like "Fuck, what was that?"
Man I don’t know, but it made me feel so heated
How we creep without showing you jack
Shit from below, give a shit if you know
Cause even if you did, bet you’d keep coming back
Back for more, need it man you're addicted to the heat
We make beats catch
Beat it 'til it bleeds to death, each track
Epileptic seize every head we crack
Like EPMD snapping necks as we tap energy from everything on and off the map

[Hook]
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that’s tight, what it's like to experience - Takyon

[Verse 3]
Takyon, shot down your throat like a keg of beer
Choke on the smoke we in and exhale 'til the whole chamber is clear
Haters act so fucking weird
Try to stain this atmosphere
But they can't cause its way too sheer
How to make a hater disappear
Take shit where it ain’t never been
Fuck what you thought could not comprehend
This shit if I fisted your brain with it
10, 9, 8, 7, triple six, five, forked tongue
Criminal level crunk lightning storm
Get out the way or get up torn
Ain’t a picture big enough to fit
What we dig up from the core
Of all that they forgot ever was
Militant march of this war

[Bridge]
Takyon - taking them down
All we see is blood
Takyon - turning them out
How to trick out and freak that buzz

[Hook]
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that’s tight, what it's like to experience - Takyon

[Verse 4]
Lunar eclipse forcing you to trip
Off the moonlit fire we spray
Cryonic haunted bullets hollow tipped with toxic waste
So here’s the deal, if you don’t feel ill
Don’t want it nowhere near my zone
That shit is dead, can't nobody get
With that shit gets dial toned
Takyon - bitch slapping pussy clots and clones
Takyon - setting off Unabombs inside your dome
Give it up, bitch, you know this is it
Get with this or get left cause it's on!
Takyon
