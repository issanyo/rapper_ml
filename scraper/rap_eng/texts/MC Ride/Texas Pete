[Verse 1: G Rider]
America's smoke screen burn hope with dreams
Televise lies and victim's screams
Go-create at least they release gray tax
They paid for by you and me, consumer
Run through blurs of hallucinated curves
Patterns swerve while I'm perved
Shroom tea heard my fural lute
Put a little commentary common weary
Intersect ideas for beats
Grief smooth shiftin' life cycles
Five free thought, approach rifle

[Verse 2: Mxlplx (MC Ride)]
Throw my life out the window
Like a square got me feelin' so little
Feel like nowhere ain't had nothin' in a while
Don't really care, got me actin' so wild
Turn it up, I'm not in the mood to smile
Burn the clutch and go that extra mile
My life style protects me like a child
Prepare to hit the highway and die young
I know exactly where I'm from
Where ya from? I'm from the high sun
Won't be done till I run out of life but
Couldn't see the light and I'm blinded
Was looking for the right way to find it
Til I found it and now I'm all excited
Trippin' off how it keeps me divided
Ain't no way to fight it, I like it so much I love it
Finally found what could be trusted
