[Hook 1]
Who you think you are?
Fucks like, "Do you know who I am?"
Fucks fail to understand
I’m like, "Eh"
Who you think you are?
Fucks like, "Do you know who I am?"
Fucks fail to understand
I’m like, "Eh"

[Verse 1]
Two letter text, translation: next
Skip that rerun like ya see one
Seen ‘em all get eh
Have you the slightest I.D. why?
You’re so trifling
Second I see you coming I’m teeth sucking like, eh
My voice, eh
See my reflection, eh
Invited, excited, eh, eh

[Verse 2]
No one’s ever seen me feel shit but eh
Lil’ bits of eh gleaming, like Piss Christ
Cover me like skintight
Why my rep is like why they might be right
I’m kinda sketch, I might
Shoot a glance at the desperate like
Then I forget shit like Death Grips, like eh
I wave them off, I wave them in
Gotta flake, I fuck ‘em off ‘cause I ain’t them
I’m like, "Eh"

[Verse 3]
My approach like I’m ghost-like
I’m out of focus ‘cause
I’m coated with the most stripes
Late movement on my trajectory
Anomalous like entropy
Make all things perforated
They apply iodine to trace this, I’m like, "Eh"

[Bridge]
Posse up steadily feel your void split, I’m like...
Posse up steadily feel your void split, I’m like..."Eh"

[Hook 3]

Who put your obese flex on ice?
Whose effortless corrupts your dice?
Who does you just like I told you?
Tell me, what’s it like, I'm like

[Verse 4]
Don’t be a, don’t be a
‘Bout mummified worm in the sun
When shit’s up to me ‘cause
I figure I’ll watch you urn, I’m not concerned
I’m on leisure like, eh
I’m just on leisure
Why fuss don’t be a medical procedure
Just stamp my fucking visa
I’m way too loose like
Catch me hanging from my noose like, eh
How I vandalize full moon like
"You’re so serious, ease off
I don’t feed animals, you seem lost"
I’m offended like, but in the end I’m like, eh
