[Verse 1]
How I ride, why I ride, never really had to try
I, I, I ... eeuuhh
Never mind that (Black jack)
Needle to the mainline junk prepared in a head that
Never came up for air
Fallin' apart, can't get a grip
Dont give a fuck if I did
Way shit goes
It'll be just fine
Oh, oh, oh
How to rob men blind

[Refrain]
(Can't do a thing but fold)
Yeah watch that
(Can't do a thing but fold)
Yeah watch that
(Can't do a thing but fold)
Yeah watch that
Can't do a thing ... (Black jack)

[Bridge 1]
Comin' from that hit me until
Twenty one makes
Your chips mine
Black jack don't trip
You got the bill
Twenty one shots to your grill

[Verse 2]
Bow down or die everytime
I slap them things
Flat black chains rattlin'
Shawshank the box
Can't be contained
Man came to pick the lock
Empty the vault
And leave no trace
Sleep don't wake
Hit 'em low and keep rollin' to the beat no breaks
Slow it down then accelerate
To hell it's cake
Like sellin' weight
No middle man
Made bitch mistakes
(Blackjack)
High king, ace, to knees the place put down by G's raisin' the stakes
You know what's up
Straight
How the fuck is that?
(Blackjack)
You know what's up
Straight

Tongue push bankroll off my lips
Who the hell are you legit?
What the fuck you think, man? Shit
(Blackjack)
(Always keep my)

[Verse 3]
No need to count the deck
I own it
Drop that
Lead chin check
To your dome it's on black
Respect me zone or get caught back-handed leather strap hit you so hard knocked flat broke by a bloke with that golden contact glove hold the smoke
Of most high fire bon tap tap
