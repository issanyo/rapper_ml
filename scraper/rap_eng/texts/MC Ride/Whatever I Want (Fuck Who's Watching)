[Intro]
Hand yourself over
Remain calm
I only plan to steal
Whatever I want

[Refrain]
Fuck who's watching
Fuck who's watching
Fuck who's watching
Fuck who's watching
Fuck who's watching
Fuck who's watching
Fuck who's watching
Fuck who's watching

[Verse 1]
Lay
My head in furnace (Fuck who's watching)
Cream
Proof of purchase (Fuck who's watching)
Ghost in machine
Laced
When I spit on your face (Fuck who's watching)
You'll take what you can get
Not once (Fuck who's watching)
Have I been had yet
My skull in nylon, my throat like pipe bomb (Fuck who's watching)
Give it give it to me 'til you're all used up, play play) (Fuck who's watching)
Don't forget to fuck off

[Hook]
Whatever I want
Whatever I want
Whatever I want

[Refrain]
Fuck who's watching
Fuck who's watching
Fuck who's watching
Fuck who's watching

[Verse 2]
I lose it, I can't remember why (Fuck who's watching)
No agenda, still can't remember, I
Uncross my fingers (Fuck who's watching)
Heard you claim we've met before (Fuck who's watching)
Always forget who they are (Fuck who's watching)
Lay
My head in furnace (Fuck who's watching)
Cream
Proof of purchase (Fuck who's watching)
Ghost in machine
Laced
When I spit on your face (Fuck who's watching)
You'll take what you can get
Not once-

[Hook]
Whatever I want
Whatever I want
Whatever I want

[Refrain]
Fuck who's watching
Fuck who's watching
Fuck who's watching
Fuck who's watching

[Verse 3]
My blood, my blood, my blood, my blood
My blood, my blood, my blood, my blood
My blood, my blood, my blood, my blood
My blood, my blood, my blood, my blood
(Fuck who's watching)
Lay
Cream
(Fuck who's watching)
Lay
Cream
(Fuck who's watching)
Lay
(Fuck who's watching)
Cream
(Fuck who's watching)
Lay

(Fuck off and you'll be alright!)
Whatever I want
Whatever I want
Whatever I want
