[Hook]
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop

[Verse 1]
Your crisis is my alarm
Why I'm like, "Shh, stay calm"
You fight shit I ride upon
My knife been drawn

3-6-5 light of dawn
Lit up rock you live under
Ass backwards motherfucker
Features like hot butter

Like your brother's your father
And your sister's your mother
Trend setter maximum
Third planet from the sun

Orbit my lungs
Bulldozin' cul-de-sacs
Ground under over every act
Cut no slack, no slack

[Hook]
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop

[Verse 2]
No chance to throw, I rush the mound
Rage stormin' off the chains
Remind me of rape house slave cock rings
You're played out like talking

Your cadence is sloppy
Can't break me, I got me
You're grave stink, I'm lofty
You're lady like loli

Pop tramp on that jigaboo
Goddamn, I'm so sick of you
I despise that shit
What I would never align me with

Feel free to mime me but don't be saltine
When I call you a biter, bitch

[Hook]
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop

[Outro]
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop
