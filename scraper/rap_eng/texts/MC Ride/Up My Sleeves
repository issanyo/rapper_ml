Sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves
Up my sleeves, up my sleeves

[Verse 1]
(I'll take my life like I kept it)
I'll take my life like I kept it
Up my sleeves never sounds like you meant it
Up my sleeves, I'll take my life anyway I can fetish
Snatch my fetish, snatch it only as directed
Snatch it cause I got the queen's tits
Up my sleeves, snatch it like you're the queen's bitch
Up my sleeves, I hold your ground with my perch
Up my sleeves, feel my slur, quench my hearse
Up my sleeves, I don't wanna cut my nap
I don't wanna fuck you back
I'm whirling, ohh, my agony's priceless
I'll take my life any way you can slice it
Snatch my shaman fetish
Diner in the desert for effect, for effects
Snatch my shaman like connect, disconnect
(I'm a) I'm the wretch Maya

[Background: Refrain 2]
I've always known
I've always known

[Verse 2]
If you can't snatch my fetish, I'll FedEx it
Notify me when you miss it
I'll be in my liquid
Pickle punked lavish
If you miss it, I'll track it
My fetish like magic
Feel contrived instant you snatch it

[Bridge]
Snatch my, snatch my, fetish
I keep it, up my-
Snatch my, snatch my, fetish
Snatch my, snatch my, fetish
I keep it, up my-

[Interlude]
Like I'll ever know
Was like I even want to know
Was like I never didn't know
Was like I don't know I don't know
If I'm so necessary
Blank blank obituary
At Broadway cemetery
At Broadway cemetery
Was like I'll ever know
Was like I even want to know
Was like I never didn't know
Was like I don't know I don't know
If I'm so necessary
Blank blank obituary
At Broadway cemetery

[Verse 3]
Tsk tsk tsk, my terracotta army
Disarms me, disowns me
Also, also, also, Mr. Whippy told me
Hit play highway hocus, ain't much more highway can ride me
My dead mother in my dream, remember when December
Blew her ashes 'cross my jeans, off these jeans
Something's only I have seen, some people only I have been
Used to know who I was, fuck if I knew who that was
Pay no mind, illogical, just don't die in a hospital
Oh, yeah, I should be worried, oh, yeah, I'm temporary

[Background: Refrain 2]
Don't but when I do
I'll tell you how I knew
I've always known
I've always known

[Verse 4]
I was conceived, by my disease, up my sleeves
Anyhow, anymore, anyone, anything
Anywhere, anytime, snatch my fetish

[Outro]
Nothing you can offer I ain't hocked
Up my sleeves
Everything's nothing to me, I'm knocked
Up my sleeves
We can't maim a martian till you come
Up my sleeves
I abstain from being and succumb
Up my sleeves
Don't feel none, I flog the remedy
Up my sleeves
Alchemy for your bodily
Up my sleeves
Nonsensically
Up my sleeves
Got a pendleton on my valley
Up my sleeves
