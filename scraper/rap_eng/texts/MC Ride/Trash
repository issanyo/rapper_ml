[Hook 1]
We know trash, we know clean don’t last
Never last when we load trash
We upload trash
Face down, trash begets trash
We know trash, we know clean don’t last
Never last when we load trash
We upload trash
Face down, trash begets trash

[Verse 1]
I'm cloaked trash
Poker fucking polygraphs
My dirt so baked, man menstruate
After each take test, say I passed
That’s trash, I’m trash
Kind you mine to trade for cash
You’re trash, born trash
Eye you close, all I see’s more trash, mi amor

[Hook 1]
We know trash, we know clean don’t last

Face down, trash begets trash
We know trash, we know clean don’t last
Never last when we load trash
We upload trash
Face down, trash begets trash

[Verse 2]
Stoked ain’t shit
I was over that for this whole shit
Taste of my blood bliss
Fuck who I wasn’t
Commodify my lack of progress
Specifically the process
But this lukewarm elixir
My blood’s real shit, sir

Be it motel six to vogue vino trash
Local Comcast to shit Vevo ads
From upper mid to been repossessed
Face down, trash begets trash
We know trash, we know clean don’t last
Never last when we load trash
We upload trash
Face down, trash begets trash

[Verse 3]
This side of my machete
Fall out mercury confetti
Ebony skies, I died already
Liquor store counting pennies
I’m in motion, do you savvy?
I exhume ‘cause it relax me
Watch you think ‘bout that? Don’t fight it
Smell me though, fucker quiet
Cyclone in a gortex shell
Audio input for my spell
Show up for what? This cig’s too plush
Long as my smokescreen’s holding up
I hold this down like high contrast
Stills taken from shade on flash
I’m so shade tree it makes me laugh
Every time you reply that’s fine

[Bridge]
Lawn glad stretch (My life sucks to me and my life's a lie)
'til it sag like breast (My life sucks to me and my life's a lie)
Off fat fucks, stressed (My life sucks to me and my life's a lie)
‘cause they can’t compress (My life sucks to me and my life's a lie)
Extra bump this shit is sex, decrepit sex
Shit, I got something for this orchids
