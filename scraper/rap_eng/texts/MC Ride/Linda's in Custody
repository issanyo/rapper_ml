[Intro]
Trust me trust me you know us well
We purge herds of stunted cells
We nurse the worm until it swells
(Eat it like the devil's cunt)
First to kneel cursed to feel
Trust me trust us we know you will
Tide come crashing in like steel
Makes your passions taste so stale
(Eat it like the devil's cunt)
Cobwebs turn your insides pale

[Verse 1]
If significant piece of me spill
Little pinot pouring out my gills
Pass a carafe perhaps I’ll swill
My grief may leak but can’t congeal
Word nihil you know the drill
To last rattle on a long swig tail
Till last drop wind through mine like scales
Compromise your position become theirs

[Chorus]
Day breaking glyph hissing
Sanity fucking bitch skinning
How do you say come to me
Hanging out with Linda
I heard she’s in fucking custody

[Verse 2]
Need new escape we’re a trained magician
I’ve just the uranium griffin
Land you there in ribbons
Where your thoughts stay hidden
Fair for a square made soft for digging
Word nihil you know the drill
Amp cooking guilt gives a thunder stealing window licker
Her moods big for real
Head hunting blunt kissing death dumping body gripping

[Chorus]
Head hunting blunt kissing
Death dumping body gripping
How does she say come to me
Boosting with Linda’s in custody

[Verse 3]
Must admit shit’s not luck how we
Manage to elude locked up in county
Every chance a fuck gets I’m counting
Sleight of hand sleight of hand from the valley

[Refrain]
Word nihil you know the drill
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Burns whoever she kills
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Think you got the will to jump
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Think you got the will to jump
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Think you got the will to jump
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Think you got the will to jump
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Word nihil you know the drill
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Her moods big for real
Eat it like the devil's cunt

[Bridge]
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a

[Refrain]
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Think you got the will to jump
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Think you got the will to jump
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Think you got the will to jump
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Think you got the will to jump
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Eat it like the devil's cunt
