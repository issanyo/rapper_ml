[Verse 1]
Other side of the tracks
Scuzz outsiders
Nothin' to loose
Strike of midnighters
(Lost boys)
True black and blues
No shoes, flat tires
Broke out the pen
Blood on barbed wire
Safe in your home
Gated zone terrorizers
Nowhere to go
Far as I can get hitchhikers

[Verse 2]
Fuck a job, might have to rob
And don't know just to get by, word
On the road for lifers
Bullets in the fire
Check the chain link
Swayze, I'm slummin'
Let 'em know who the fuck we are
Low and dirty lost boys
Comin' out the cuts
Like your favorite scar
Crawlin 'on tile, can't stand up
Been a while, kommodo gut
How to take it
How to give a fuck
How to live with pain
How to get your cut
How long's this been goin' on?
Man shit no way to tell too far gone, go get those flames from hell bring em here
Don't trip, no
I'll handle this
On some scandalous
Inland empire, Los Angeles
Anti-ego propaganda shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who's comin' up? Who's losin' ground?
2012, I'm shady now, running game on every thing in town

[Chorus]
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys

[Bridge]
It's such a long way down

[Verse 3]
Brown paper baggin', asphalt scrapin', all talk no action, what I'm waitin'
Weak tongue waggin'
Stray dog beggin'
Like don't hurt me
Yeah right, I'm sayin'
Beware you have been warned, the barrels still warm, ease up off that lip or step
How quick a bitch fit to get checked, mate
One false move'll get ya
Set straight
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

[Chorus]
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys

[Outro]
Oh yeah yeah
(Ride through the sky of black mist)
