[Verse 1]
How'd you know? 'Cause I was there
Yeah, that shit go, came prepared
Set it slow rolled, anticipation grow slow
Deviated septum, blow hole, sugar cane ko ko
Ayy, ayy, pass the dro my way or no way twenty fo'
No 25-8, thought you knew, suicide lane, fuck you
Grab my crotch, what's my name? Been 'round the block
Hangin' scumbag slangin', pay dirt cave in, takin' no prisoners
No escaping wash brain hook, nothin' I'm sayin'
Ayy, ayy, know what I'm sayin?

[Chorus]
I got the diamonds, scrapin', sidin'
Wastin' my life in altered states, them, back it up
I got the diamonds, scrapin', sidin'
Wastin' my life in altered states, them, back it up
I got the fever, I got the fever
I got the fever, I got the fever

[Verse 2]
Sprayin' execution, witch fingernails clawin' through them
Crawlin' through them tunnels, losing touch with everything I'm doin'
Argh, mass confusion, can't make more electrocution
Half cocked, full tilt, rabid dog, filth, argh, know what I'm sayin'?
Fuck it, upside down in a soft top bucket, screamin', shred it

[Chorus]
I got the diamonds, scrapin', sidin'
Wastin' my life in altered states, them, back it up
I got the diamonds, scrapin', sidin'
Wastin' my life in altered states, them, back it up
I got the fever, I got the fever

[Verse 3]
Let me off, screeching halt, concussion blinding, not my fault
Ankles tied to cinder blocks, ayy, ayy
By any means necesserated, blade cut me, sewer drain grated
Bubonic plague spreaded faceless, lurking in the deadest spaces
On your knees, black goat anus, christo anti-clan of shameless
Came to whip those into shapeless, here we go, devastated
(Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go)
(Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go)
Diamonds scrapin' the marrow, out my core
Who's in the mirror? Who's at the door?
Someone's there, wasn't there before
Ceiling connected to the chord, pull it, pull that shit, pull that shit

[Chorus]
I got the diamonds, scrapin', sidin'
Wastin' my life in altered states, them, back it up
I got the diamonds, scrapin', sidin'
Wastin' my life in altered states, them, back it up
I got the fever, I got the fever
I got the fever, I got the fever
