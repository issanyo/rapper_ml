[Intro]
We are preaching our own funerals as we go through this life
Don't forget that

[Verse 1]
Hit it, split it, make it cum, get wetted
Come again, come get it
Seen it happening before it even happened
Swing the door open and buck 'em down
Course I'm just fuckin' around
But nevermind the way it sound
Everytime we make it pound
Straight into the pavement now
Whip it, bleed it, cause it pain
Eat it, shit it out and change
Lanes at speeds that seem insane
To them petty pussy brains
Push me and they will be slain
Drag this past the point and claim
That shit as if it was your name
Like it's attached to yours with chains
Own it till shit goes up in flames
And there really ain't no one to blame
No one to blame, its all the same
Like blurred faces on subway trains
Can't take it man, can't take the pain
Pain of the game
Makes me insane
Makes me fuck up my whole thang
Pain of the game
Makes me insane
Makes me fuck up my whole thang
What'd you bring?
Where'd you get it?
Give it here, I said don't sweat it
I'm gonna take it around for a bit
And I don't care if you give a shit
Punk!
I'm gonna take it around for a bit
And I don't care if you give a shit
Punk! Bitch!

[Hook]
Goin' through the motions
Just to make shit happen right
Never knowin where we're goin'
Just rollin' like waves at night

[Verse 2]
Make it or break it, just dont sleep on it
Sleepers get shot down, you lost it
Trying to act like you got it
Nevermind the way it sound
Every time we make it pound
Straight into the - (sirens) - ground
Shot it up, get it hot, what
I know you know you said too much
Did too much, way too much
Fuck that shit, man, that shit sucks
Volume turned all the way up
You already know it's going down
I'll tell you when I've had enough
Shut up right now
Feel it in my gut right now
Throw it up, give it up like
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, blow!

[Bridge]
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up

[Verse 3]
All over the place, all in your face
All up in it, talkin' 'bout can't wait
To bring it even harder the next
Time I creep through the beat possessed
Howling on that mountain peak
Feeling like hell's up in my chest
Feel the fire rise, rise so high, so high I rise
Eye to eye with death
Gazing through me like an uzi
Spraying through me, bag of flesh
Body bag of flesh
Ain't nothing left
Toe tag me, zip the bag and check it
Oh no, he's been resurrected
Oh no, he's been resurrected

[Bridge]
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up

[Verse 4]
Zombie holocaust in seconds
Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
From what we know, down deep inside
Hell if I know, just wanna ride
Until the wheels fall off and I
Run off the road, no telling why
Hear them cry:
"Man, I just don't wanna die
Just don't wanna, why
Is everything always happening
In the blink of eye?
This better be the last time me
Ever see you in my life
Steadily to the death passing
Everything that don't seem tight

[Hook]
Goin' through the motions
Just to make shit happen right
Never knowin' where we're goin
Just rollin' like waves at night"
