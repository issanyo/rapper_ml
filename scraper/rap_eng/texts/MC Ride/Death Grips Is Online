[Verse 1]
I’m doing handstands on her trans am
Pretty pretty nine, spinning, spinning blind
Fitting into crime, itch to fuck and grind
Death Grips is online, drinking from its spine
Living till I’m fine, pretty, pretty nine
Color me a cult, echo in my throat
Cut it for a smoke, took it for a spin
Spun it out to float, blew me as a friend
Fuck it, I’ma go Death Grips is online
Black Madonna womb, collar for a goon
Suck it till you’re stole, steal me a new role
Hunger of a chain, through this mud cling
Don’t let you pose on a blue rose
Lick a, lick a grim, set it chrome again
Chemical to learn, load it up and gleam
Sprinter out a curve, shooting up a scene
Bitter end to share, blotter in the air

[Refrain]
Punks get nailed all in the daytime
And I got good friends who love to headline with a—

[Chorus]
Pretty, pretty nine, pity, pity motherfucker
Pretty, pretty nine in your city, motherfucker
No laws here, airsoft start popping off
That flack get quit snitches wear
Pretty, pretty nine
Pretty, pretty nine

[Refrain]
Punks get nailed all in the daytime
And I got good friends who love to headline with a—

[Verse 2]
Dirty, dirty, strip mall sugar
Melody to hail, symphony to dick
Jealousy to file, entropy to flip
Felony, you buy, indica, I rip
Hella, hella hot, flagging like I’m not
Vanish as I can, damage as I been
Ultra other shit minus all the trim
Catalyst to milk, memory to stiff
Break it to the hilt, fuck it like a kiss
Paper tiger boss, pussy wanna front
Shake it like the law, only cool to hunt
Take it like a hint, miss it, get the dick
Climber get a jerk, super ape as shit
Nightly on a tram, knuckle white the stance
Phaedra ‘hind the cam, work us in a trance
Lock us in her van, drive us outer space
Day we never land, only thing I’ll taste

[Refrain]
Punks get nailed all in the daytime
And I got good friends who love to headline with a—

[Chorus]
Pretty, pretty nine, pity, pity motherfucker
Pretty, pretty nine, in your city, motherfucker
No laws here, airsoft start popping off
That flack get quit snitches wear
Pretty, pretty nine
Pretty, pretty nine

[Outro]
Got good friends who'd love to headline...
