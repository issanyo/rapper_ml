[Intro]
Pass that shit

[Verse 1]
Hold on man
Park the car
I have no idea where we are
Think we may have drove too far
Yeah I can see they're right behind us
But there's nothing we can do
We can't get caught slipping, get off that shit and just be cool
They're on to us
But don't look now
They think they're 'bout to take us down
Fuck that, I'm not going out

[Bridge 1]
Pass that shit

[Verse 2]
At the next corner, turn left
It's time to handle this
Nowhere to go don't trip
Have no time for that pussy sh-- AGH
In a minute it'll all be finished
What you don't think I speak the truth
You think I could just be sittin' here
Listenin' to Sonic Youth
Anywhere when they try to ride
On you thinking I'm gone
I'll creep up on 'em from behind
And break 'em off one by one
In the time it takes you to blink your eyes
Shit'll already be done
But just in case anything goes wrong
Keep your right hand on your-

[Hook]
So when they step up out the car
Yeah, I know this sounds bizarre
But now I remember where we are
Do what I say and you'll be fine
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin', steady creepin'
Blood creepin'

[Verse 3]
Shake the bottle what's it hold
How many have I already sold
Hope not too much cause I feel insane
Need more than one to numb the pain
Slithering through my brain
Thoughts stuck on that train
Off the track and up in flames
Fuck it, I'll swallow these blue ones
Yeah, and maybe this big one
And I might as well take a few more with me just in case I get some
I know you want 'em, yeah, no problem
Got that covered, tramp, I brought 'em
How it creeps up on me so slowly
I don't notice my eyes rolling
To the back of my head and falling
Shit, somebody's calling
Can't answer the phone
Call 'em back when I'm 'bout to leave
Can't think straight, man, I'm so fucking blown

[Hook]
So when they step up out the car
Yeah, I know this sounds bizarre
But now I remember where we are
Do what I say and you'll be fine
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin', steady creepin'
Blood creepin'

[Bridge 2]
Down the alleys in the middle of the night
I'm trashed, so high it's hard to ride my bike
Might crash whenever I'm this fucked up
Drunken monkey through the cuts
Who gives a fuck?

[Outro]
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin', steady creepin'
Blood creepin
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin', steady creepin'
Blood creepin'
