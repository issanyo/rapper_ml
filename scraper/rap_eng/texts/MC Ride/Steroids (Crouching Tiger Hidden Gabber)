Section 1: My Whole Life

[Chorus]
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
Your whole life, your whole fuckin' life
Your whole life, your whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
Your whole life, your whole fuckin' life
Your whole life, your whole fuckin' life

[Verse 1]
Slippery when panickin', this seems like surfin' gasoline
At the mercy of my discrepancy
I've got countless current identities
Which one should I pretend to be?
Which will be the end of me?
Fuck my present coordinates
I will 'em dead like, like, like, like, like, like, like
It's not what you think
Fuck you want from us?
We're the same as you
But we know we're fucked
But we came as you, like you know it's us
And your mind, not you

[Chorus]
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life

[Verse 2]
Cut one, spill revelations, it's fucked
Center seal of my imagination, fucked
Forehead of mine submergin', I'm sinkin'
Noah's Ark, blood's virgin, stop thinkin'
See now? There ya go
It's alright, your write-offs belong to vultures
My whole life like vultures
Brain coverage is more like
My vision ain't no good on my sore side
There ya go, there ya go, there ya go, there ya go
There ya go, there ya go, there ya go, there ya go
There ya go, there ya go, there ya go, there ya go
Cut one, spill revelations, it's fucked
Center seal of my imagination, fucked
Forehead of mine submergin', I'm sinkin'
Noah's Ark, blood's virgin, stop thinkin'
See now? There ya go
It's alright, your write-offs belong to vultures
My whole life like vultures
Brain coverage is more like
My vision ain't no good on my sore side

[Outro]
This ghost town's my compound, I'm a saboteur
Your town's my smoke cloud, I stay at war
By night shift I don't exist, chump, saddle up
A dust to dust motionless struck belly up
Your skies are lip balm on my balls
Elemental cyclotron on white walls
I met you and your carne asada to cry
Fuck everything, now go ahead and pay us for my shrine, wait
This ghost town's my compound, I'm a saboteur
Your town's my smoke cloud, I stay at war
By night shift I don't exist, chump, saddle up
A dust to dust motionless struck belly up
Birch wood emoji wrought with human branches
Your innocence save your hopes, I just throw the dice
And I've been like this for my whole fucking life
My whole fucking life's your whole fucking life

Section 2

[Intro]
Panic, panic, panic, panic
Panic, panic, panic, panic
You know this bitch, this is the bitch you know
I would not fuck a basic bitch, bring a bitch and I want more
Uptight bitch, your blood’s like bitch, right? Zip tight flow
Handle a bitch, handle a bitch, handle a bitch like so
I'm not no bitch like that
That bitch go, they start off and strip like plat'
Fuckin' with C-notes, like please don't, that bitch might act
Handle a bitch, I'll handle a bitch, I'll handle a bitch like that
Woah, I'm dead, bitch
Your blood's like bitch, right?

[Verse]
Last bitch feel branded or somethin'
That bitch more ate up than my lunch
That bitch make me take my time
Makin' for change, they gonna come
Bitch always been assed out
Kiss your black ass on the mouth
Shit, had bitch, that bitch is broke
Said, broke bitch, I'm on that dope

[Outro]
Bitches more sick
I round 'em up and spin real quick just like a mat
They feed that flame and get loud as fuck
Kool-Aid, bitch, I blaze a bat
Bitches more sick
I round 'em up and spin real quick just like a mat
They feed that flame and get loud as fuck
Kool-Aid, bitch, I blaze a bat
Bitches, I round 'em up and spin real quick just like a mat
They feed that flame and get loud as fuck
Kool-Aid, bitch, I blaze a bat
Bitches more sick
I round 'em up and spin real quick just like a mat
They feed that flame and get loud as fuck
Kool-Aid, bitch, I blaze a bat
He's a bitch, she's a bitch, sorry bitch

Section 3

[Verse]
Exist like a drunk man at the wheel
But first sittin' in the front, not at the wheel
No clue I could fuck you 'cause I will
Fuck praise, all it does is pay my bills
I faced the crowd in Vegas there
Ever fake but isn't where
Shit ain't raw, they can't compare
Check AWOL, bitch, I'm always there
Intangible intrusion to the bone, through the bone
Feels human bones, human skill
Blessed on windmill and opium feel
Bumpin' shit, I leave open seal
Ghoulishly austere, paralysis is my souvenir
Exit wounds and rabbit ears
Rabbit holes that last for years
Now can you see I have no fears?
Not havin' cares, post-stratosphere
(Witness post-stratosphere)
Misspoke language of savoir faire
Don't need to come with the stolen hair
Stranger slip by, catch my interest
Look for a minute at a safe distance
Lose my place, look back, see no one
Death won't wait, will adapt when it closer
Death won't wait, will adapt when it closer
Death won't wait, will adapt when it closer
Milk that daylight, jump this vanish
I like this type, that's refined manner
Sullen every way, steppin' off when it happens
Sullen every way, steppin' off when it happens
Sullen every way, steppin' off when it happens
This is why I'm swimming in a faucet of acid
I bum a dialogue instead of renting it
Call in the place and get an estimate
It's diligent on paper, I'll invest in it
Be weird if I could make it as a mesmerist
Have a tall list of clients to tamper with
Be a practicing confessional
Cultivator of masochists
Crave sanity? I'll make you vegetables
Your family'll think like pacifists
Cool long as I don't move my tongue
Cool long as I don't bite my tongue

[Chorus]
I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rights of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit
I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rights of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit
I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rights of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit
I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rights of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit

Section 4

[Intro]
Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl
Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl
You want to know who I am?

[Verse 1]
No one's girl, stoic girl
Only fucks fine foreign girls
Makes your muse, play it ruse
Awakens your fantasy, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory

[Chorus]
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl

[Bridge]
Attention
I am the dragon from the desert

[Verse 2]
Hate makes me reckless, restraint cease the functions
You get the best of me, but I'm missin' one in my stomach
Killer for the occasion, whip you back to size
Break you like a Franklin, spend you like a five
They like, "How come? How come, though?"
They come at meals, fuck no
Right on, I'm that killer, you're a fucking sidearm
Think twice, face down
Don't bleed like this Cape Town
Don't sleep like no playground

[Refrain]
Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl
Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl

[Chorus]
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl

[Verse 3]
Farewell, fuck you hopeless
On three, spread out, then move in
Strategy, cauterize all loose strands
Finder's life can't be too thin
My spotlight proof to no end
Pursue this life with no friends
Bet your own at your own risk
'Cause farewell, fuck you hopeless
And act like no one notice
On three, spread out, then move in
Strategy, cauterize all loose strands
Finder's life can't be too thin
My spotlight proof to no end
Pursue this life with no friends
Bet your own at your own risk
'Cause farewell, fuck you hopeless

[Bridge]
Me and my doppelgänger have a system
My shoulder pain loads ammunition
These counterfeits are mostly sober
I pen the script, he pilots the saucer
It's funny, the bored pose of my dead man
We both scramble until I'm the last man
Stay in first so much I have four left hands
He arose disgusted, I awoke in Bethlehem

[Chorus]
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl

Section 5

[Intro]
Don't ask me where I came from
Ignore me anyway but
Stick it if you think it
Happens when you can't stop

[Verse 1]
Came to in a sports cage
Five minutes, coulda swore it was a decade
Had the time of my life, no head case
Zoom with the camp where we jump for fuck's sake
Threw it off over end of the hard way
Lie back, then I shut down my heart rate
Enter threshold of blind man's hallway
Hell'll turn a tightrope to my causeway
Two burned rascals call me hombre
And now you're fuckin' with mojo
Side shift like bold fungus moonglow
I flatline straight through to the loophole

[Chorus]
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Personalized like genetics and provide all your needs
Don't be frightened by skeptics, listen essentially
You're sleeping on a goldmine

[Verse 2]
Tone of our voices means our location's a runaway
I'm before all your destinations, I'll be on display
I’m fuckin' on your schedule, explanation’s in delay
Pathway enchanted encounter, feed that hoe a chainsaw
Burned up at myself, back to the floor
Moment I do, my bustle was such a bore
Pull that way, run your vehicles 'cause you know it's cool
Put my fist on a pedestal 'til I stroke the core

[Chorus]
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Personalized like genetics and provide all your needs
Don't be frightened by skeptics, listen essentially
You're sleeping on a goldmine

[Verse 3]
No matter what, stay where you are, if you go
Don't matter who you shot, there's no scars where you are
Never felt this, but I been so lost, nothing's broke
Make your life a demand, things don't blow to be all gone

[Outro]
A hybrid night container
Carbonated thrift store
Your peter is the peak
Of hubris marked in vain
Hi

Section 6

[Refrain]
Sick like, sick like

[Verse 1]
Fall out on impact
Never been left, what's worse
You must have that contention
That greenscape, that witch fur
What if I was strapped like toothpaste?
Like filler ass, dig grave
I feel staffed like Rick James

[Refrain]
Sick like, sick like

[Verse 2]
Chinchilla, rich blood
Mindset, core forms
Timeless, but I admire
Improvised explosives
Glowed off, my darlins
Good labor, my harlot
Blood form
With the ice flow garnet

[Refrain]
Sick like, sick like

[Verse 3]
Molten like karma, it's abstractions of bliss to me
Intolerance removes lava, high pressure like quick release
Counterstrike red Bambaataa on those tears
Get by, stampede off billions
Stagnant eyes, spring rupture, drop off here
Said my deadbeat

[Refrain]
Sick like, sick like
Sick like, sick like
Sick like, sick like

[Verse 4]
Doubtful, you stand in pride
Turnin' me down so quiet
Silence guided by vision
Assailant inside the figure
Can't hide from suspicion
War-waging prescription
Street life breaks you like religion

[Refrain]
Sick like, sick like

[Verse 5]
Hooded figure exploit your demons
Cast profit, go to buy, try, can't knock it
Bet a bitch forward this market
Better get numbered, you're profit
The offer day
The offer day, you're numbered
Try to flee, but you can't leave
You get paid to suffer

Section 7

[Chorus]
At the time, didn't recognize myself 'til I was petrified
But half the time I'm not myself
So most of the time I don't question why
We did testify, but best I can do is buy some time
Spend my time folding time
Even met myself one time
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body

[Verse]
Nothing matters anymore
You can’t see the kraken
Climbing out the bullshit that exists from the mouth
You can’t get out of debt
Just learn to keep on stabbing
In the heart with a fucking knife
You drop it before you can catch it
Do you see what's taxing?
All life's a moment before the grave
You're only optimally the passenger, a slave
From the middle finger
Open up the sewers before you, drop this ring, reave
The culture hiding behind this life, kill the pain

[Chorus]
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body
At the time, didn't recognize myself 'til I was petrified
Black body, body
But half the time I'm not myself
So most of the time I don't question why
Black body, body
We did testify, but best I can do is buy some time
Black body, body
Spend my time folding time
Even met myself one time

[Outro]
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body (with no hope)
Black body, body (with no hope)
Black body, body (with no hope)
Black body, body (with no hope)
Black body, body (with no hope)
Nothing matters anymore
You can’t see the kraken
Climbing out the bullshit that exists from the mouth
You can’t get out of debt
Just learn to keep on stabbing
In the heart with a fucking knife
You drop it before you can catch it
Do you see what's taxing?
All life's a moment before the grave
You're only optimally the passenger, a slave
From the middle finger
Open up the sewers before you, drop this ring, reave
The culture hiding behind this life, kill the pain

Section 8

[Chorus]
All I see are sycophants
Hunting for that little bit
Never will get sick of it
Take it like the middle one
Learned about how sick it is
Every word is cinema
Find me off a precipice
Flying like the state of drugs

[Refrain]
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it

[Bridge]
Dance, you motherfucker
Get on 'em, motherfucker
Get 'em like a man
Petite like Southern, hit up like clan
Ya'll nations are stuck in gutters fastened by checks
Desert creek kumbaya, feed that snake like mud
I'm too sick now to eat, I inspect my money just 'cause

[Verse 1]
Question must be scroungin'
Nobody came to flex, it's poundin'
But I bet that's next, the mountain flecks
Off this map's rips, it's grounded
By the thousands, they walked in the valley
Act like you care while I get you out of it
Like I said, get the fuck off my couch
Ain't worth shit if it ain't about me

[Chorus]
All I see are sycophants
Hunting for a little bit
Never get sick of it
Take it like the middle one
Fucks you admitted for?
All I see are sycophants
Hunting for a little bit
Never get sick of it
Take it like the middle one
Learned about how sick it is
Every word is cinema
Find me off a precipice
Flying like the state of drugs

[Verse 2]
I'd rather not get involved
I'm not that much, never been that much
But I saw too much to pay shit off
Too stuck, no way, weigh off that much
What can I say? Fuck what you say
You can ask around if you think I'm frontin'
Never been that much, but I got here first
Get the fuck out, bitch, while I do my work

[Refrain]
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
