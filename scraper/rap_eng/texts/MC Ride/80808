[Verse 1]
Air raid, I slang the math raider nation, black cab
Psychic radio also known as
Only channel in our mobile lab
I got that priceless touch, won’t cost you a fucking thing
Biter appear instantly, got pigs to feed
You see my pimp, she’s pissed at me
Aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, bite that
Acquire this link, it’s a ringer
Cop my steeze, make yours much fresher or whatever
Aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, bite that
Flock of pigeons come
I got crumbs, biters, bob, and slum

[Hook]
Aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, bite that
Feeds the gank move
Biters eat the gank move, fuck with me
Aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, bite that
Feeds the gank move
Biters eat the gank move, fuck with me

[Verse 2]
Fuck with me
I keep my street the same
Pave these potholes see no rain
Lately I seen rain fall close range
Ain’t no thing too clean don’t bang, besides
Can’t trust a man with cream as white
As hundred clean cocaine
I’m custom like you like
Biters in my sights

[Pre-Hook]
I got that priceless touch
I got that priceless touch
Aye doe, bite that, aye doe, aye doe, aye doe
Aye doe, bite that, aye doe, aye doe, aye doe
I got that priceless touch

[Hook]
Aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, bite that
Feeds the gank move
Biters eat the gank move, fuck with me
Aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, bite that
Feeds the gank move
Biters eat the gank move, fuck with me

[Verse 3]
I hardly notice them
I toss all bums generous portion of my goat
But I keep the bones
Aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, bite that
Mastered by me magnified
My laughter fed back through your swine
Your forehead tat my hazmat tag
Serpent coil egg and flag
Aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, bite that
Twins sat rows all identical
Not seen as a threat or so we’ve been told
I hold the key, I blame the key
Made me defame the mold

[Pre-Hook]
Aye doe, bite that, aye doe, aye doe, aye doe
I got that priceless touch
Aye doe, bite that, aye doe, aye doe, aye doe
I got that priceless touch

[Hook]
Aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, bite that
Feeds the gank move
Biters eat the gank move, fuck with me
Aye doe, bite that
Aye doe, aye doe, aye doe, bite that
Feeds the gank move
Biters eat the gank move, fuck with me
