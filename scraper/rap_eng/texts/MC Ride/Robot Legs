[Verse 1: G Rider]
Fucked up and hungry, struck up some money
And matchsticks blunt zip locked backs, honey
And in-scents ten cycles commence through dance
Out those [?] in the pocket of my hoodie
When we smoked the hole length instead of food on the plate
Smoke a bunch of Doja in cold blurs of vision
Through the windshield, men peel, feeling steel
Major of existence, grab your shield

[Verse 2: Mxlplx (MC Ride)]
Refuse to be a slave, let nothing get to me
Don't tell me to behave, don't want your misery
Beyond the grave feel, no sympathy
Calms the wave, kill my history
Been gone for ages filled with mysteries
Sing my song and blaze this trail of fricassee
Take you all the way there and leave you be
Make you wanna say "I just need to see
A better way to play until infinity"
Forever in a day, disappear
Instantly left you staring like little babies
Out of thin air and it was so crazy
Not really carin' though, cause I'm lazy
Always sharin' just what God gave me
It's never fair, man, everything shady
That's why you're scared, man, looking for safety

[Verse 3: Swank]
I could have never read the sign
And if I did, probably would have stopped the time
For the fever, pick it up and shine
If yo' a bleeder, you better get behind
Opinionated ass, the river's mine
Swallow the city with hopes to recline
Bit the top off the natural design
Taste the jet lag like ice cold wine
I know they wonder why I feel so fine
From the distance shaved down my life
Stacking shrapnel lies in the light
Hard to handle, but easy to fight
