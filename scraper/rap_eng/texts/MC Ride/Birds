[Hook 1]
I got tomorrow coming, I got, got, I got
I got tomorrow coming, I got tomorrow coming
I got, got, I got, I got tomorrow coming
In-, birds, fuck you

[Verse 1]
I've got a bluebird, it might die
It got wetted, I stayed dry
I'm not trying to use my mind
I got that attitude at all times
I've got this attitude at all times
I got a black hat, it might live
It's got a black hat, it goes big
I had a bluebird, now it's did

[Hook 2]
1, 2, 3, 4
One bird, two birds, three birds, four (two)
Five birds, six times, life is war
One bird, two birds, three birds, four (two)
Fuck you think I fuck this for?

[Hook 1]
I got tomorrow coming, I got, got, I got
I got tomorrow coming, I got tomorrow coming
I got, got, I got, I got tomorrow coming
In, birds, fuck you

[Verse 2]
I got, you not, in my way
I got right now between my legs
I put right now between your legs
I got today shoveling graves
I got tomorrow turning in your grave
I got Jesus, he got saved
I got power, it's so cheap
Fuck this bird, bitch, drink this bleach

[Hook 2]
1, 2, 3, 4
One bird, two birds, three birds, four (two)
Five birds, six times, life is war
One bird, two birds, three birds, four (two)
Five birds, (three) six times, life is war

[Bridge]
I got higher, I got fake
I got higher, I got fake
I got higher (higher), I got fake
I got higher (higher)
I got- birds, birds

[Hook 1]
I got tomorrow coming, I got, got, I got
I got tomorrow coming, I got tomorrow coming
I got, got, I got, I got tomorrow coming
In-, birds, fuck you
