[Verse 1]
Third rail over one nine breaker
Slit throat, cut creator
Hung from dem nail, hang 'em high, savior faire
Trans-siberian epic, trek through dat
Next switch, set it off the roglyphic
Jackal-headed dawn of the under
Check it, check one check
You can suck it 'til  I get disgusted

[Bridge]
Fuck that, naw fuck that
At me wit that weak shit
Bitch slapped across the street and back
Head crack, wanna know where I'll be at, whatever

[Verse 2]
Get off mine I got that juice, noo style
Cut your brain stem as my combat boots grind your head
To the cadence of this dreath stompin' mu
Sick as fuck contagion wagin' war with all you knew, bitch
Mossberg ballistic flux massive
My shure beta 58a hazmatted
Pump pump slugster radioactive
Ride through a mine field laced wit black magic
Straight from the mayday, naw fuck that (one)
Broke off its axis, polar shifted granite
Knock made ta off every last bitch on this planet
Fuck that, naw, fuck that

[Verse 3]
Came ta bad dem brains 'til dem neck bones crack
Arrested cardiac, black mass murder rap
Dealer push your wig all the way back
Head wear your face like a yamakulapse
Never can tell where you're at
Eyes stuck on the sky always gettin' jacked
Tryin ta lookin the mirror like fuck that, naw
