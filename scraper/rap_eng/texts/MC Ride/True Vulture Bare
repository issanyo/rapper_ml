[Verse 1]
Come and get it
'Fore it gets you lead-headed
Shuttle jacked up
Double barrel shots
Either you're there or you’re not
True vulture, my man
Why you want what I got?
Yo, money, watch that red dot
On your brow, twelve o'clock
Get down to hell drop
A-a-a-as your whole life
Flashes before your eyes
And don’t nobody know why
True vulture, my man

[Hook 1]
It's money man, yo money
It's money man
Fuck the dime, I keep the mic in my hand, cuz
(Fuck) them no understand
Them no understand
Them no understand
True vulture, my man

[Verse 2]
Gonna bring the subculture, get ran
Through like the hole in your head
Go there and you’re dead
Nothing's fair except fare
Collateral damage (Fuck)
You’re expendable
Fuck that, collect capital, it stacks into stupid dough
Use the star axis to set it
Monsters in cubicles
Take that death by jacked funeral
Full blown and gagged individuals
Am I a savage? Hell yeah, like you didn't know
Future primitive digital
Black google visual
Runaway the rebels, curtain fall snap back
Pro-line original
Stay some time in official, ohh
Shit, that’s so federal
Missile represent it
Don’t know, don’t ever forget it, ho

[Hook 2]
It's money man, yo money
It's money man
Fuck the dime, I keep the mic in my hand, cuz
(Fuck) them no understand
Them no understand
Them no understand

[Verse 3]
Why fools will never know
Fuck your performance
That live break houses the ritual
No different from the recorded transmission
(Fuck) in the studio
Two black and blue trenches
So thou pay my food plus capital
It's money, mayne
Try to hang but got banged
By that black buku
Flamed to wax voodoo
Simulate dead ass like shrooms
Eat a cap and watch the bass launch the face off the moon
While I'm takin' new cakes and find
A new way to get blown
Your money’s my money, mayne
What’s up with the struggle?
Get down with it or get caged
By the laws of the jungle

[Hook 1]
It's money man, yo money
It's money man
Fuck the dime, I keep the mic in my hand, cuz
(Fuck) them no understand
Them no understand
Them no understand
True vulture my man

[Outro]
Yo, yo, money
