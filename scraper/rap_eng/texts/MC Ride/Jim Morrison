[Young G]
I used to love freestyles, now I love to write
In my mind I see styles, you can use it to unite [?]
And fly it like a kite, 'bout to get rolled
I'll be slamming 808 when I'm 80 years and 8 days old
Too bold to fold it now, [?]
Get blowed [blow?], [?] crystals and behold
Tails over 909 get toked
Precious is a freedom that you hold
Payin' bills, watch your rides get sold [?]
Night time get cold, inside mind, decode or explode [?]
Scriptures that we wrote, pictures through [Kiov?]
Same blood, on the gold knife to the lymph node
Pleasures from the shelf, message gettin' post
Blessed blessed 'stros [?], exhaling out my nose
Hope you hate my prose, this chapter's closed
The path of least resistance is not the path I chose

[Mxlplx]
Addicted to the mirror, I can't stop looking
Is it really there, or maybe I shouldn't-
Ask what i'm here for, take life and put it in a glass with some beer
More than just a crooked head with a conscience
Somebody took it, can't get back on it
Appear cryin' look it [?]
Fly it like a comet through the sky at night
Try not to vomit after losin' a fight
Put holes in my closet when I don't feel right
Wonder why I bought it, cause it's not really tight
Wear pain [plain?] like a locket, hands cover my sight
Start up the rocket, head first for the light
The sun is too hot, it's burning my life
Realize I polish my heart with a knife
The blade straight through my bloody dream
Waiting for you like a puddle of cream
I wish I had the guts to go, but it's just not enough to know

[Swank Daddy]
I took a drag and bake it mo' danger [?]
Promise to love you if you stay a stranger
Rather kiss a killer than an entertainer
Keep on refusin' my passion with anger
Watch the longish [?] tears scope the midnight singer
They say that suicide is on a good dreamer [?]
People [??????????????????]
They say you never look, but I mention they see ya [?]
Hope you can smile in empty arenas
Took your drag and broke out [?], misdemeanor
If you love me, if you hate me sing
You love me if you hate me sing [x2]
Don't give a damn about a thing
If you look in my eyes as I look past your beat [?]
You know what's going on in a synchronized stoff [?]
