[Verse 1]
Little Richard took a picture
He got triggered by the click'a
He got beat up, he got bigger

[Refrain]
Little Richard, Little Richard

[Verse 2]
Little Richard, he's in the dorms
He's gonna bomb and look good when he bombs, in the dorms
Maria Sharapova, yes, as good as anyone's guess

[Refrain]
Little Richard, Little Richard

[Bridge]
He just needs to A, B, C, and D
He just needs the world to be what he has seen

[Verse 3]
In the horn section, they hide weapons
Bottom of a white bic, chewed up like a pig's dick

[Refrain]
Little Richard, Little Richard
