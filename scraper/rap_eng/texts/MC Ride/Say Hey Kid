[Hook 1]
I do what my people would
Because my people would
But only if my people could
I would if my people would
I do what my people would
Because my people would
But only if my people could
I would if my people would

[Verse 1]
Happy's perfect
Perfect's tame
Tame and cashmere go together
Cashmere makes perfect better
Jon and Shelley, my people would never
Don't it feel good to drive a bus?
People need to get picked up
Pride your uniform and stunt
You do what my people would grunt
Don't it feel right to sell a tent?
People like to tell your scent
Pause the bus, put off your yell
You yell, all my people would say

[Hook 2]
Hey, it's a party
Come early if you're lonely
Say hey kid, say hey, don't you O.D
Say, hey, don't you O.D
Come play dead
Say, hey, don't you O.D
Come play dead
Say hey kid
Say hey kid
Say hey kid
Hey kid!
Come play dead
Say hey kid
Say hey kid
Say hey kid
Hey kid!
Come play dead

[Hook 1]
I do what my people would
Because my people would
But only if my people could
I would if my people would
I do what my people would
Because my people would
But only if my people could
I would if my people would
I do what my people would
Because my people would
But only if my people could
I would if my people would

[Verse 2]
Support, gravity, my people would
Support, gravity, my people would
But what are my people for?
Your wife has a lovely neck
But what would my people suck?
If they would I could I guess
I guess her neck's the best
Her neck's just the best
Hello there, hello there
I'm perfect now and then
Jon and Shelley are my friend
They know what my people for
They know your wife's neck's my cure
No question, I'm sure

[Hook 2]
Hey, it's a party
Come early if you're lonely
Say hey kid, say hey, don't you O.D
Say, hey, don't you O.D
Come play dead
Say, hey, don't you O.D
Come play dead
Say hey kid
Say hey kid
Say hey kid
Hey kid!
Come play dead
Say hey kid
Say hey kid
Say hey kid
Hey kid!
Come play dead
Say hey kid
Say hey kid
Say hey kid
Hey kid!
Come play dead
Say hey kid
Say hey kid
Say hey kid
Hey kid!
Come play dead
