[Intro]
Streaky
Streaky, streaky, streaky
Streaky
Streaky, streaky, streaky, yeah

[Chorus]
Streaky on the outside
Stand by, dealer hold a franchise
Southside, do me 'cause it sounds tight
Streaky on the outside
Oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh)
Booty on the outside
Stand by, dealer hold a franchise
Southside, do me 'cause it sounds tight
Booty on the outside
Oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh)
Flag full of backslide
Bye-bye, do me 'cause it sounds tight
Streaky on the outside
Oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh)
Streaky on the outside
Stand by, dealer hold a franchise
Bye-bye, do me 'cause it sounds tight
Booty on the outside
Oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh), oh my

[Post-Chorus]
Don't throw it on the ground, yuh
Take me to the bank, certified amount
How I heard about, she's a walkabout
Dream time announced
Don't leave your shit around, what
Take me to the bank, certified amount
How I heard about, she's a walkabout
Dream time announced
Booty on the outside

[Verse 1]
Can't double back, double stack, triple stack, jetpack
Low crack, low sale, grand prize, pay 'em gram, can't lag
Might pay to feed that, speed gap (oh my)
Lost highway, speed neck, seek Jane
On deck with no grease trap
High stake that, one-take track, can't fake that
Cut it back, go back, back, take that

[Chorus]
Flag full of backslide
Bye-bye, do me 'cause it sounds tight
Streaky on the outside
Oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh)
Streaky on the outside
Stand by, dealer hold a franchise
Bye-bye, do me 'cause it sounds tight
Booty on the outside
Oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh)
Booty on the outside

[Verse 2]
Keratin on pants dried, good to paraglide, blare a fie
Surfin' through a tail pipe
Stick shift stun drive, turn on a tail light, sail like
Learn you how to dead right
Bounce with no downside, down for that joyride
Ghostride, bouta do a no rod
Low ride, grip it like a cheetah fly
Bonafide creeper type

[Chorus]
Streaky on the outside
Stand by, dealer hold a franchise
Southside, do me 'cause it sounds tight
Streaky on the outside
Oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh)
Booty on the outside
Stand by, dealer hold a franchise
Southside, do me 'cause it sounds tight
Booty on the outside
Oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh)

[Post-Chorus]
Don't throw it on the ground, yuh
Take me to the bank, certified amount
How I heard about, she's a walkabout
Dream time announced
Don't leave your shit around, what
Take me to the bank, certified amount
How I heard about, she's a walkabout
Dream time announced
Streaky on the outside

[Bridge]
Streaky
Streaky, streaky, streaky
Streaky
Streaky, streaky, streaky
Booty on the outside
Streaky
Streaky, streaky, streaky
Streaky
Streaky, streaky, streaky
Booty on the outside

[Chorus]
Flag full of backslide
Bye-bye, do me 'cause it sounds tight
Streaky on the outside
Oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh)
Streaky on the outside
Stand by, dealer hold a franchise
Bye-bye, do me 'cause it sounds tight
Booty on the outside
Oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh)
Booty on the outside
