[Intro]
(That's me)
(And that's all you)
Can I break it down?
(And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down?
(And that's all you)
Can I break it down?
(Oh, Mya)
(And that's all you)
(That's me)
(And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down? (Oh, Mya)
(And that's all you)
(That's me)
(And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down?
Can I break it, can I break it down? (Oh, Mya)

[Verse 1]
Nah, n-nah, n-nah, wh-what it do?
Humiliation, I refuse
Inside shaking, nah, I'm cool, got this
Iâ€™m not you
Bow down, give it-give it to me, baby
I gotta do my girl, she's down
B-B-Been only since I-
In the truck
Give me some more, I said it's calm
Callers at the door (Can I break it down?)
Jump on 'em, my bumps in the whip
Crazy from the heat, talk to the- erghh
(Can I break it, can I break it down?)
Perversion mastiff, seven fingers left
Still curtain pumping, n'oh, I lay Jesus fresh to death
And God is panic, they gon' tremble
Here me swear you seen the devil
Hear me step-to with it, fatal
These faces roundtable

[Hook]
(And that's all you)
(That's me)
(And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down? (Oh, Mya)
(And that's all you)
(That's me)
Can I break it down?
(And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down? (Oh, Mya)

[Sub-verse 1]
Try to break this cycle, broke me
Told me, "You'll see," you don't know me
Kinda freaky, she's bony
So sh-she on me (on me)
Listen closely
Why don't we, one night only?
(Can I break it, can I break it down?)

[Refrain]
Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
-ck around and lose my mind, I'm on that
(Can I break it, can I break it down?)
Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
You're runnin' out of tricks
(Oh, Mya)

[Verse 2]
Jungling out of my shoulders
Light at the end of the tunnel's
A lie, I look forward to runnin' 'em over
Eye of the storm of the dolo
There you go, there you go
Down that road, down that road
(Can I break it down?)
Lost in exhaust with the windows closed
Shut the door, nothing more I can do
Try to see why it would be like this
Tell her roam like palindrome, back and forth
Like all that be, I can see from my back porch
Do it that, do it, I can't try no more
Difficult to live it slow, I'm so bored
If I'm not ever squattin' on my bike
Ridin' 'round like, "Kid, well, now I have no life"

[Hook]
(And that's all you)
(That's me)
(And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down? (Oh, Mya)
(And that's all you)
(That's me)
Can I break it down?
(And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down? (Oh, Mya)

[Sub-verse 2]
Cha-ching slot, micro dot
Bet and lost my spleen in Reno
All them dimes for your casino
Jungle bars, we mescalina
Thin walls, heaving
Linoleum splitting
Lost in dead
Space emitting a metallic smell, can't take its sickness

[Bridge]
Runnin' it, runnin' him over
Can I break it, can I break it down?
Runnin' it, runnin' him over
Can I break it, can I break it down?
Runnin' it, runnin' him over
Can I break it, can I break it down?
Can I break it, can I break it down?

[Refrain]
Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
-ck around and lose my mind, I'm on that
(Can I break it, can I break it down?)
Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
You're runnin' out of tricks
(Oh, Mya)

[Sub-verse 3]
666, I'm at the gates
9, the gate's coming down
8, I escape
11, I'll never be found
7, I die
13, swallow my tail
15, I'm on fire
51, I'm off the scale

[Outro]
(Oh, Mya)
(And that's all you)
(That's me)
(And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down? (Oh, Mya)
(And that's all you)
Runnin' it, runnin' him over (That's me)
(And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down? (Oh, Mya)
(And that's all you)
Runnin' it, runnin' him over (That's me)
Down (And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down? (Oh, Mya)
(And that's all you)
Runnin' it, runnin' him over (That's me)
Down (And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down?
