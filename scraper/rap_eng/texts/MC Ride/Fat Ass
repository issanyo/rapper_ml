[Verse 1: Mxlplx (MC Ride)]
Wanna ride you like a donkey, every night never get off me
Spread it like you really want me to feel right
[?]
Get on top while I sit tight
You will drop slowly up then
Down my cock screamin' "Stefan"
Don't you stop heavy breathin'
Now I've got to get up for my attention span
It's so short, let's start up the van
And drive to New York and if you can
Spare a newport, pass it here cuz I'm out of smokes
Draggin' years down my throat

[Verse 2: G Rider]
Bass line slammin' like Iverson
Space time continuum influx riding
Ridin' through potential
Movin' sacks sequential
[15-3-15?] 12-50-40a presidential states
And the continent blockin it then chalkin' clits
Clock [it sits?]
In my mind [as a central?] residential incidental
Monitor my mental [?]
Since bent welcome back fine print
And weed, the need to get keyed
For now I put in work till i'm free
Wage slavery, what the world made a G
Only other option
D-I-E

[Verse 3: Swank Daddy]
Change my mind for the chance of the change
A heart on cobblestones in the shooting range
Fire slow [?] and a million stains
Saluting stones standin' in rain
Make love alone, to leave this plain
With freedom on fire released in rage
Love on three tires, turnin' the page
For the riders rollin' out the day
Riskin' the blessin' to cash the pain
Find the women in the four lane
Betting the devil then endin' the game
Man I got it, so keep the change
Love to roll on an empty train
