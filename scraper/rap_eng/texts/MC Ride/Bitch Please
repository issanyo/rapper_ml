[Intro]
Who wanna catch this?
Who wanna catch this?

[Hook]
Bitch please, you must be smokin' rocks
Real shit for my people
And it just don't
Fucker please, you must be smokin' rocks
Real shit for my people
And it just don't

[Verse 1]
Drop it like-
Oh yeah, that's so trashy
How low can you go?
How dirty can you get? Nasty, fucker
Drug through the dirt
Razor cut that eight millimeter make it hurt
Chain sleaze leather face
Fucker please, you must be smokin' rocks
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
Hit it, fuck it, feel it, whip it, burn it, turn it out and kick it to da curb
Shut it down
Forged in the flames, said it before and I'll say it again
Quazar game maximum vacuum rotation spin s-s-s

[Hook]
Bitch please, you must be smokin' rocks
Real shit for my people
And it just don't
Fucker please, you must be smokin' rocks
Real shit for my people
And it just don't

[Verse 2]
When shit goes down I'll be there
With my hand on my gun, and my eyes on the road
Ghost ridin' to hell, fuck if I care
Who wanna catch my droze?
Give a fuck, blood, I ain't goin' nowhere
Templar night and day, live an die by the code
Code of the street, how to stay in the zone
How I own it and freak it to the base of the bone
I am the darkness creeping through your system
The lash of da whip
Cracking every bitch
Into position
Workin' you over crashing and burning in a blackhole blasting out
Your subwoofers are melting
Hear a bitch say, "Why's he yelling?"

[Bridge]
Who wanna catch this gun clap?
Shrapnel off me lip cause blood bath

[Hook]
Bitch please, you must be smokin' rocks
Real shit for my people
And it just don't
Fucker please, you must be smokin rocks
Real shit for my people
And it just don't

[Verse 3]
Cause I run this lik
Like dogtown ripped
That raw shit like none other
Low down dirty shit
Shot off this hip
Death Grips, mothafucka

[Outro]
Please, you must be
Smokin' rocks
Real shit for my people
And it just don't stop
Bitch, please
