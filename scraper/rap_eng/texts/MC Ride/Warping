[Hook]
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping

[Verse 1]
Influence executed
Mass execution, rapid improvements
Toothless accent, drawl of a shaman
Putrid fanatic ride out like famine
Luminescent rattles, thunder in vials
Choose your battles or end in piles
Braided fumigation, destitution ramped
Desiccated satyr make a massacre dance

[Hook]
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping

[Verse 2]
Psychotropic steel trap, rock a beat up Bears hat
Naw man, I donâ€™t feel this and I shit on your guilt trip
Then extinguish your illness like seven grams of thorazine
Tyrannic authority cleansed by your aggressor
Inhuman elitist decline your surrender
Sign of the freak thriving on a bender
Forbidden discipline, all lines disconnected
Vacated premises occupied by my death wish

[Hook]
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping

[Verse 3]
Luster of entrails stacked and slung
Under cement veils my traffic hums
Compulsion on risers, your stranglers knuckles
Your temples buckle
Decompression silo inside this muzzle
Overdriven rituals on my torso, my infernal boro
If I went soft Glock to my navel
Flaws get knocked off, flaws get knocked off

[Hook]
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping
