[Chorus]
My moods live on that swing same
Push me harder, push me, push me, swang into tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Gawk as I thread this loch ness slipstream sepsis
Subconscious up F twitch asterisk see off my meds glitch
Thoughts squealin through my mildew
Watch my back or I'll kill you
Schizo superscript scan the voice imprint, only I can hear you
Deserted mansion in my head, half-lidded lanterns returnin
Sclera scarlet as wall of virgin, bombed by flask of bourbon
Can't be certain
Your intercom I'm fingering
You don't wanna, but you buzz me in

[Chorus]
My moods live on that swing same
Push me harder, push me, push me, swang into tomorrow
My moods live on that swing same
Push me harder, push me, push me, swang into tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Nathan perculatin proper
Caiman propellers comin' off, she's hella copter
My neck bone sprayin' guava
Shimmy snakin status caved in mental state been shanked and soldered
I got the nasty in my taxi
You need a lift? You can sit between the backseat and my dick
If the law catch me in the act and I happen to die today
Push one my swing out in a glass of purple rain
Candy-painted by the lord of stainless steel liquid your ashy brain

[Chorus]
My moods live on that swing same
Push me harder, push me, push me, swang into tomorrow
My moods live on that swing same
Push me harder, push me, push me, swang into tomorrow

[Outro]
I got that feeling somebody killed me
I got that feeling, zero feeling
Can't stop stealing, zeros killing all your millions
Somebody kill me, somebody killed me
I got that feeling, zero feeling
Can't stop stealing, zeros killing all your millions
