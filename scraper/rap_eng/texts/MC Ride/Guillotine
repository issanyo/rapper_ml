[Hook]
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!

[Verse 1]
Sit in the dark and ponder how
I'm fit to make the bottom fall through the floor
And they all fall down - yuh!
(It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes - yuh!)
Out of the shadows barrage of witch tongue
Cobra spit over apocalyptic cult killer cauldron smoke
Stomp music seriously - yuh!
(It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes)
Can't stop the groove licks jaws clear off them locks relentless raw movement
Fit to knock you from here to that g-spot body rock connected
To everything you want, ever did want, we got it why not come get it
Stick your head in that hole and watch me drop this cold guillotine death sentence - yuh! yuh!

[Hook]
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!

[Verse 2]
Hidden art, between and beneath, every fragmented, figure of speech
Tongue in reverse, whenever the beat
Causes my jaws to call out, out, out, out - yuh!
The screens flashing red, can't see shit but heads
Spinning exorcist like planets out of orbit off the edge
Off mine axis whipping through doors to far more than all thatâ€™s ever been said - yuh!
Tie the chord, kick the chair and you're dead - yuh!

[Hook]
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!
Guillotine - yuh!

[Verse 3]
Head of a trick in a bucket, body of a trick in a bag
And thrown in the fire like fuck it, gotta burn it before it goes bad
One too many times been disgusted by the stench of rot is such a drag - yuh!
Get broke by the street like blood stained glass - yuh!
Choke on these nuts till the very last - yuh!
(It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes)
Serial number, killing machine, the illest of means
To an end built on the filthy sound you're experiencing - yuh! yuh!

[Hook]
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!
Guillotine - yuh!

[Verse 4]
Tinted windows, bulletproof
The slip knot fixing rope to noose
To the grave stone grinder of cold steel
The passion that blinds me so I feel - yuh!
Can't let go, no it flows through our veins
Blows through our tunnels and rattles our chains
And they all fall down - yuh!
