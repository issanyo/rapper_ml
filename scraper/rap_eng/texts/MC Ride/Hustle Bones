[Intro]
Give a fuck what you heard
Yeah, fuck what you heard
'Fore this real shit kicked your whole clique to the curb
What, what
What, what
But you don't hear me though

[Bridge]
Run up bitch to the death get gripped, my steeze is ballin' out
Of control; what you know 'bout bubblin'
Hustle bones comin' out my mouth

[Hook]
Hustle bones comin' out my
Hustle bones comin' out my mouth
Hustle bones comin' out my
Comin' out my mouth
Hustle bones comin' out my
Hustle bones comin' out my mouth
Hustle bones comin' out my
Comin' out my mouth

[Verse 2]
That hot lic a shot
Never not strapped
With a Glock tongue cocked
Run it back
That knock a cop off unconscious molotov cocktailin' sound bomb a snitch
Flat line of chalk drawn 'round the clock too many marks dropped to count the stiffs
Stuck on the fence
How does it feel?
It don't make sense
Nothing is real
That rip you a new one trick, I'm the true one
And only never know me never will, no son
Leave you laid out to fade out
Show a cunt the door
Hit and run
Hustle bones comin' out my mouth

[Hook]
Hustle bones comin' out my
Hustle bones comin' out my mouth
Hustle bones comin' out my
Comin' out my mouth
Hustle bones comin' out my
Hustle bones comin' out my mouth
Hustle bones comin' out my
Comin' out my mouth

[Verse 3]
That can't wait to blast
Blood-stained knuckle brass gives a fuck sick with it flav on
That ex-con
Hard to the bone
Darkness from the zone
Mastered and pushed far beyond
Eons beyond the line never crossed
By them punks livin' soft while I ride that bomb
Dr. Strangelove
Into the sun
Look no hands megatons
Rode like man we can't lose
No shit, no shit
That hit it till it drip with
The blood of the raw way
It was 'fore them forgot
Why doin' dirt, make slang sound tough gong original
Fuck the wrong way
Only one real way to work
That shit out the
Beat street spit
Ãœber freaked heat lit
Hell flame to your brain
Blood thirst
What, what
What, what
What, what
What, what
Run it back, run it

[Bridge]
Run up bitch to the death get gripped, my steeze is ballin' out
Of control; what you know 'bout bubblin'?
Hustle bones comin' out my mouth

[Hook]
Hustle bones comin' out my
Hustle bones comin' out my mouth
Hustle bones comin' out my
Comin' out my mouth
Hustle bones comin' out my
Hustle bones comin' out my mouth
Hustle bones comin' out my
Comin' out my mouth

[Outro]
Criminal intent, anti-legal ill
Thief in the night, peel your life back spin the wheel
Criminal intent, anti-legal ill
Thief in the night, peel your life back spin the wheel
Criminal intent, anti-legal ill
Thief in the night, peel your life back spin the wheel
Criminal intent, anti-legal ill
Thief in the night, peel your life back spin the wheel
Run it back, run it
