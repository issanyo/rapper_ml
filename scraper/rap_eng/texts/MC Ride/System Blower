[Hook]
Yeah, we came to blow your system (blow)
You know what I'm sayin'?
Kill it or die
Braggin' about how you
Had it all dialed
Well, what's up now
When your shit is-

[Verse 1]
How I'm comin', why I'm slingin'
Where I'm from and what I'm bringin'
Tell your cousins, best stop sleepin' cause I'm bustin' for no reason at random murder
Killing season
But no one heard me
Cold blood creepin'
Full tilt swervin'
Through your bleedin'
System burnin' to its knees and
Beggin' for mercy while I'm leanin'
Hard to the left
And clockin' a-gripsin' the death pockets of the head knock rhythm

[Bridge 1]
System blower, system over

[Hook]
Yeah, we came to blow your system (blow)
You know what I'm sayin'?
Kill it or die
Braggin about how you
Had it all dialed
Well, what's up now
When your shit is-

[Bridge 2]
And blow your system, system blower

[Verse 2]
Stupid dope fiend beat low hung blood spray all over
The death stomp drums
Scum worshiping
Speaker ripping
Pun2k weight holding heretics
Boundary reapin'
Frequency freakin'
Out 'til we're like, "That track sound so sick"
System blower, system over
Got heads jumpin' out their skin
Talkin' 'bout, "Come on
Death grip me again"
No need to wonder if
It's gonna crack
Hell no, you can bet
We're fit to burn the
House to the ground
Soon as the sound gets checked

[Bridge 1]
System blower, system over

[Hook]
Yeah, we came to blow your system
You know what I'm sayin'?
Kill it or die
Braggin' about how you
Had it all dialed
Well, what's up now
When your shit is-

[Bridge 1]
System blower, system over

[Verse 3]
Yeah, trick, go fetch my whip
Gotta let a mark know
Who he's fuckin' with
Ruthlessly skin a chump
Just for kicks
Can't fuck with this
Sadomaso-kiss my fist
Suck my dick, it's not cool
I'm too sick, what time is it?
System blower, system over
Deep in the klink base
Cut straight to the chase
Like a triple shot of 180 proof
Kill-o-watts riots audio violence
Breaks your windows and
Takes all the loot
System blower, system over
Silver coin on your eyes
Forever closed
Raise the dead
How long I been tired of that old
Can't nod my head
Shit is over
System blower

[Outro]
System blower
