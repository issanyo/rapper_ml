[Verse 1]
Goin' back to Tangier
With some Jordans and a spear
Post-Christian shit
Post chicken or the egg addiction shit
Pass the sherm stick
Neo-reality
Be the freak you wanna see
Just don't follow me
I'm on a journey to the center of three
Grab your fucking chain and drag you through the bike lane
Leave you for everyday people to teach
About crossing the fucking street
I am the pregnant snake
Stay surrounded by long hairs
A plethora of maniacs and spiral stairs
Make your water break in the apple store
Sink or swim, who fucking cares
Cut the birth cords
And they pretend, press send
Fuck earthquakes with you
To serve an Earthquaker power supply
D.I.Y., Do or Die
Dick is on a dick
Gaga can't handle this shit
Headed for the Sammy Davis wing
Throw up a black hole at the entrance of Linens-n-Things
On the way
Never call it a day
Visit Tesla's grave for the ninth time today
Still on the way
Bigger wigs

[Hook]
Earth angel, earth angel, answer the call
Earth angel, earth angel, answer the call

[Verse 2]
We sell antimatter in red cups
Free refills for what is like us
Hail face, that'll be half a buck
Celebrities are out of luck
For my stargate opens, they splatter like
Who knows what the fuck
Am not
Their slow motion caught features in materialize
The table's flipped, now we got all the coconuts, bitch!
In the highest of hacker swagger

[Hook]
I'm in a transitive headspace
While my dick still seems shaved
Earth angel, earth angel, answer the call
Earth angel, earth angel, answer the call
On a door placed between God's legs
Where dragons roam and lesbians will cut your face
Earth angel, earth angel, answer the call
Earth angel, earth angel, answer the call
Man with deformed face
And in your freaky hustle
Take what you love cause it'll cost you double

[Verse 3]
You'll catch a jpeg to the head
Ã¼ber reach
You're an intern
I'm Wikileaks
Most loved, therefore most hated
Come and knock on the door, we've been waiting for you
Game changer
Reclusive-aggressive
Ying-ing and yang-ing, noided
Info warrior, Jack the Hacker
The rolling stoner, puffin' on disaster
Upload my face, crash the gates
Union pacific clicks straight from his city
Now I'm at the Reddit game
With the Olsen twins in cold space
Back rumbling set my fingers, the Colosseum faints
That shit makes the siren sing
Nothing shall be wasted on me
Survival's too fucking faded, A.K.A. Life Pollution O.G
My existence is a momentary lapse of reason
Got the DNA of Gothic lemons
Shred it thirteen times out of eleven
Your bad ideas are the ATM
Shed my skin
Leave it for the homeless to sleep in
And I'm breathing cause someone smoked the right shit in Eden
Order given: Adam smash out in Switzerland
2080, a newborn son
I will be here
Prodigal, fuck that nautical
Teachin' bitches how to swim

[Hook]
I'm in a transitive headspace
While my dick still seems shaved
Earth angel, earth angel, answer the call
Earth angel, earth angel, answer the call
On a door placed between God's legs
Where dragons roam and lesbians will cut your face
Earth angel, earth angel, answer the call
Earth angel, earth angel, answer the call
Techno protests kicking religion off the lawn
I'm the universe with standard issue combat boots on
Bitch!

[Verse 4]
Burmese babies under each arm
Screaming beautiful songs
The cray-cray ultra-contrarian
Havin' conversations with your car alarm
When you come out, your shit is gone
Soon your crew will be serving sandwiches named after me
Vietnamese style, fool, please
Fly up to the caller's street
All the owls holler at me
Huff as a ghetto, so I'm staying broke definitely
So let the pyramids of [? 4:01] no show
Cause the gods said so
Everybody's like "No!"
Eighty-thousand glow sticks crack for nothing
That's the fucking joke, ho
Front row at the mass games
Untraceable by name
You speak of us in certain circles, you will be dethroned or detained
Dumpster-diving through dimensions out of your world

[Hook]
Earth angel, earth angel, answer the call
Earth angel, earth angel, answer the call
Earth angel, earth angel, answer the call
Earth angel, earth angel, answer the call
