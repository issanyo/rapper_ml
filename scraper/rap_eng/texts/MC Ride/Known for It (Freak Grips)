[Intro]
Get it
Get it
Get it
Known for it
Get it
Get it
Known for it

[Verse 1]
Known for it, been through it
Done everything I can to it
Road to it, till I broke through it
Never was attached to it
Took all I had in a flash knew it was 'bout to crash
So I mashed through hit
Known for it
Had to do it
Hacked into it

[Hook 1]
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?
Don’t it?
Known for it
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?
Don’t it?
Known for it

[Hook 2]
Let them eat shit and die
As I creep lit
Off the deep hits with a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon to freak this

[Verse 2]
You can tell me what you said - go ahead
But no sooner than you said it
You can bet it was left for dead
All you said in and out of my head in seconds
Keep 'em guessin' endlessly
Never let 'em know where you're headed
King of the unknown cloaked in mystery
How to show 'em they don’t mean shit to me
Put 'em in their place, cause they ought to be
Kept in the dark, not 'posed to see never, but only so much of me
Double O.G. with a skeleton key
Never meant a thing to me
Effortlessly dead to me
Check the sign no vacancy
Extremely selective memory
Known for it, gotta stay deep in the zone
Or it’ll take everything you own, floor it
(Get it, get it)

[Hook 1]
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?
Don’t it?
Known for it
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?
Don’t it?
Known for it

[Verse 3]
Known for it since way back, all about it
Never been without it
How to ride it inside out of the clouded
By the enemy surrounded
Thoughts that make you feel lost don’t doubt it
You might just need it
Already did that
Can't never go back
Yeah fuck that
Gets the bozack
Laid on the gas, leaned back and blew it
Twelve gauge blasted out, abused it
Left it for the next, hit eject done wit that
You want it you can have it, no questions asked
Left that shit on the side of the road in a ditch, don’t trip
If you have one let a man know so I could flip a bitch and kill it
(Get it)
Head for the hills when it makes you feel
Like you can't ever chill no more, fuck it
Every time I get it to wind, 'round my finger and recline
Behave or be slayed cause I will be damned if mine ever decays
Forever on attack gut check the blind
Game recognize game is tight
Bow down or get banged for life
Cause I am known for it

[Hook 1]
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?
Don’t it?
Known for it
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go, bet it
Makes you feel like a ho, don’t it?
Don’t it?
