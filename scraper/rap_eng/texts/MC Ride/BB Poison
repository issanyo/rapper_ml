[Intro]
Obey me
Obey me
Obey me

[Hook]
I sneak up on me
I shed my shh
My shock, my body clear
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me, obey me
I sneak up on me
I shed my shh
My shock, my body clear
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me, obey me

[Verse 1]
Where's your heat at? It won't lit
I'm not surprised, check your thermostat, no digits
I drop a dime, you can have that, collect your tip
Go buy a rhyme and bring my cash back, you broke ass bitch

[Hook]
I sneak up on me
I shed my shh
My shock, my body clear
Obey me poison

[Verse 2]
Never betray me, oh and while you're at it
Double my inhibitor, I can't hack it
Be my buffer, my habit hunger havoc
I digress, I can't live in this contagion
I spread into incisions on occasion
Heavily stricken witness visions
Omens wall to wall followed by a loss of any and all symptoms
It won't lit

[Bridge]
Notice me, senpai

[Verse 3]
You're like, "Hold on. Fuck, it won't lit."
Stay put, you're the wrong one, bitch don't fit
Too shook, you're flows off blood, this won't hit
Got no hook, true or false, though you can't spit
Bitter face, Frida Kahlo the Costco remix, you're a case
All you got though free shit, what a waste
How can you not know? So which is it: love or hate?
You'd rather not know why shit won't lit, fucks hesitate

[Hook]
I sneak up on me
I shed my shh
My shock, my body clear
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me, obey me
I sneak up on me
I shed my shh
My shock, my body clear
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me, obey me

[Verse 4]
Didn't mean to, I, I
Just assumed it'd be you, I, I
Never knew no idea, I, I
Was confused, excuses
It won't lit's a Rubik's cubicle
For the new cog to chew off
To sulk with and flask on
How the sick with it put my mask on

[Outro]
Zach hit them off like, "It won't lit," they shit bricks
Bbpoltergiest don't touch this, don't insist
Favorite the copyright then go home, bitch, no homeless
I'm in your house like, "Oh shit, I own this"
I'll kick your ass out, don't bitch, bitch, it's winter, bitch
Take my trash out real quick or live in it
Where's my cash out promo slip? I'm skipping shit
When I'm tacked out, my it won't lit's it won't lit
