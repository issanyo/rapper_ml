I say kill it like ya, you say hate it
Kill it like ya hate it, kill it like ya hate it
I say arrrgghh, you say can't take it
I can't take it, I can't take it

[Verse 1]
Fuck you starin' at? Didn't know I'd be so quick to flash, Terrified by the way a basilisk come out him skin so fast
Not the first, won't be the last
Barrel of my gun down the hatch
187 deep throat chokin'
Eat this fourty-four magnum dick (up)
Murder the bar raiser, inverted cross fader
Ash lung blastin' bum rush balls to the wall, bitch slayer
Rainin' blood, burnin 'paper, A. Jackson's catchin' vapors
Fuck this cage, I'll thrash you later

[Hook]
I say kill it like you, you say hate it
Kill it like you hate it, kill it like you hate it
I say arrrgghh, you say can't take it
I can't take it, I can't take it
I say kill it like you, you say hate it
Kill it like you hate it, kill it like you hate it
I say arrrgghh, you say can't take it
I can't take it, I can't take it

[Verse 2]
Step to me with that bullshit like I don't know what you're doin'
Talkin' fast, lookin' shady
You can't fade me, keep it movin'
Hopes that mo' cash will help you cope
Sorry to tell you, but it won't
"How do I get out then?" You don't
Can't keep this locked down, fuck that
Watch me now, fit to crush that
Hit it once, knock it down and I'm done can't
Stop this break out, get it come back
Underground railroad, gunclaps
To sound of sirens screamin'
Count on it, I'm leavin'

[Hook]
I say kill it like you, you say hate it
Kill it like you hate it, kill it like you hate it
I say arrrgghh, you say can't take it
I can't take it, I can't take it
I say kill it like you, you say hate it
Kill it like you hate it, kill it like you hate it
I say arrrgghh, you say can't take it
I can't take it, I can't take it

[Bridge]
Yeah I got that man, fo' show
But tell 'em why you had to get 'em though

[Verse 3]
(Get 'em, get 'em, cause I had to get 'em though)
Cause the beat bangs, cause we came to flip the oz out your sleep train
When the smoke clears, who remains?
This right here, why we claim
Out of nowhere, for keeps game
Don't go there, this the real thing
(Get 'em, get 'em, cause I had to get 'em though)
Board the plane, they're watchin' me
Bullshit stains what they want from me
Fuck that man, my philosophy:
Don't take a goddamn thing
Voice in my head, "Kill everything"
(Startin' with this asshole right next to me)
(Get 'em, get 'em, cause I had to get 'em though)
(Get 'em)
