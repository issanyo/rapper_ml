[Sample from Cheb Wasila - Hwa Heda]

[Verse 1]
Hot shit, cold shit
Okay, muthafucka, let's do this
Came to make it band sawed off razor edge maintained looseness
Comin' through, again and again conduit
Why them hands wave to
High to it
Wild fire through your city
Wild fire through your whip me
Into lightning two
K'nt hit three
Strikes dug out dated
Fools no dig me
End beat limbo, baba spitting
Blood in slow mo, la la chimney
Warholian nightmare
Storm the gates
25-8, twelve gauge pun2k weight

[Hook]
25-8 pun2k weight
25-8 pun2k weight
25-8 pun2k weight
Out yo flesh
Out yo flesh
Out yo-
25-8 pun2k weight
25-8 pun2k weight
25-8 pun2k weight
Out yo flesh
Out yo flesh
Out yo-

[Verse 2]
Stick and move, leave no proof
Discard directly after use
Forensics on that wild goose
Follow my footprints into loops
(Cause I'm too high, too high)
Cause I'm too high, too high
Feel like I'm never ever gonna come down
(Scale richter pun2k weight
Of dis sound)
Scale richter pun2k weight
Of dis sound
Down break dead space
And make it drop
To the street beneath
Your ghetto box
Slap the beat 'til the
Floor boards crack
'Neath the weight of this lic, step back
Off in the rhythm like
Beta in the bong
Got to give 'em make 'em
Sway like palms
In the wind my lip blow
Mic spray kyrlon
25-8 till the break of dawn

[Bridge]
(War war war war)
(War war war war)

[Verse 3]
Guerilla bass, straight from the trenches
Posers impaled on picket fences
How to rest your head in roach-infested basements and smoke pun2k weight for breakfast
Chop shop lifted, bump till the tape deck break
Ask samo how he flipped that material girl's pancakes as zydeco copper kettles
Liquor sto', sellin' singles
Mug shots out, to my people
Rollin' I double l spread eagle
Hear flow, then spit evil

[Hook]
25-8 pun2k weight
25-8 pun2k weight
25-8 pun2k weight
Out yo flesh
Out yo flesh
Out yo-
25-8 pun2k weight
25-8 pun2k weight
25-8 pun2k weight
Out yo flesh
Out yo flesh
Out yo-

[Outro]
(War war war war)
(War war war war)
