I've told you that I'm Lightning-
But you keep hanging around
If Lightning ever catches you
(All right)
He's got to put you down
(All night)
About six feet

We bring this for the ones who fiend to see the truth taken back in pain
The weakness of this scene of fucks who lack the nuts to claim
The streets from which that real shit comes to put you up on game
What's your name? Check it, bitch, it's Death Grips
Gutter rappin', anti-sleepin', no half-steppin'
Low life creepin', high-def freakin' detonation
Set it off, no hesitation, audio invasion
But fuck that, can't thrust that to a beam, that shit had to go
Machine that lick and let 'em blow like cream, black
It's the magic host self-ream tactic
What the fuck? I mean that shit
(All night)
(Ride through your sk-sk-sk-)
Executors of that next shit
Nest eye to the left shit
That melt your face
Till your bloody neck gets ripped headless
Death Grips!
Bow down and take this what you get bitch
Rest in bits as I pace up and down the low end of the bass
Stomping rounds, automatic fire sounds in your face
Rip them fakes out their flesh
Come test this, get this straight, no escape
Rigor mortis, dead weight
Strung up and hung by hell-tensity drum
Bitch slap negative space
You thought that it makes through a cut
That bit only info can create
To properly uno, dos, tr√©s

(Death Grips)
Ride through your sk-sk-sk-skull

Took hit to the face
Dead weight off the hook, don't hate
Shook out your footsteps and put back in your place
(All night)
Triple X heat the rain in which we move
While they choose to get used everyday
Running highs you might break if their own reek of fear
Why you wish we were here
While I say, "Get the fuck out my way"
Fit to get cut by fist gut if you stay
Thought you was on top, but not no more
That's right, whore, we're fucking you
(All right)
Fucking you
Thought you knew we had shit locked to the beat street don't stop
Licking shots for the old school freaks doing the robot
Hear this devil spit next lower heat blowin' up yo' spot
Fear high drop to your knees, trick, you know what we want
That's right, bitch, best believe this that shit you forgot
Ever was, but it is through my blood, need that fix
(All night)
Gotta catch that but lead off that high head row
Give me the mic and step back, cuz
Need to rip that, watch me bust
Where you going? Not knowing till we get there
Jack 'em off of it
The sword what you're holding till you get well
Have to hit 'em off with all you know and got that gold that make it cracked again
Control this while I hold this enema death they set my casket in
Growing like oceans, epileptic sex, can't get past this shit
Spiraling too much, on like king of the cleaners liquid acid trip

What's up with that next shit?
It's Death Grips

Illegal spit fire bum rushing you're tired as fuck
Give it up, I'm here, look, don't touch why
We're done and whip that, fuck you
I'll cut you, don't try it, can't deny it
Cracks off every time that you bite it
Try to fuck when I don't buy it

What's up with that next shit?
Yeah! It's Death Grips

Try to board this train like
"What's your name?" Check it, bitch
Jack the rip in a brain
That's just shrunken head trip
What's your name? Tic-tacking
J-just status
(Death Grips)

Nuclear fallout flesh and fire in the hole
Death Grips is some thrash, it goes right through your sk-sk-sk-skull
(Told you that I'm lightning
Told you that I'm lightning)
