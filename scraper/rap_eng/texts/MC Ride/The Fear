[Intro]
I don't know dude, I just—I just drink blood dude

[Refrain]
The fear (jump, jump, jump)
I'm gonna kill somebody (jump, jump, jump)
Don't jump!

[Verse 1]
Downs you with dull pain, won't we become strange?
Tied up with your legs, hide helps, on the way
Who will help you fall? It's just all so frail
So long since we fell, still don't know we failed
Go for the most tears, stay cause it gets strange
Went there to shed years, left there in lead chains
Been there since next year, scarred us to death chair
Scared us to rest less, skull full of house guests

[Refrain]
The fear
The fear

[Chorus]
I feel so sick today (I'm afraid to be here with you)
You wanna kill somebody (I'm afraid to be here with you)
I feel so sick today (I'm afraid to be here with you)
You wanna kill somebody (I'm afraid to be here with you)

[Refrain]
Don't jump! (Jump, jump, jump)
(Jump, jump, jump)
The fear

[Verse 2]
Pulled close by its pliers, cold, sharp, and expired
Like ribs of vampire, like winds on high wire
Whips you like it cares, push you down more stairs
Kicks you for quick laughs, don't cry, you won't last (The fear)
Missing entire weeks, months gone as I peak
Lost tongue, mystery, everyone's on to me (The fear)
Who's this stole my heels, stumbled into hell
Hates me till it heals, wakes me with the chills (The fear)

[Chorus]
I feel so sick today (I'm afraid to be here with you)
You wanna kill somebody (I'm afraid to be here with you)
I feel so sick today (I'm afraid to be here with you)
You wanna kill somebody (I'm afraid to be here with you)

[Bridge]
Frightening and embarrassing
Like one percent and pleasantries
Gather your things bolt till you reach
The crystal fields of ketamine
I'll meet you there, I'll beat you there
Bet I'll be there before you leave
Time you get there I’ll be midair
Like peace of mind's a bore to me

[Refrain]
The fear, the fear
Jump, jump
Don't jump!

[Outro]
When the rail holds you, flight like stairs grows you
Off your mind must wish, this is not my ditch
Ah that ditch wears you, host torn and worn through
Hard looks at blank walls, held way too long pause
The fear, the fear
