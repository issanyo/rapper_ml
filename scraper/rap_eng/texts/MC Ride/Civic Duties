Into the void, because I'm annoyed, because I'm annoyed
Into the void, cause I'm paranoid
Into the nothin', into the beyond
Transmitting lies, from how far I've gone
Endless echoes ricochet off the canyon-
Walls of my skull, becoming the vacuum
Losing control, people are batshit, they just don't know
At home in the vacuum, come to roll in the cold
Ego turned to shrapnel, was forced to explode
Nothing left of the original
The desert at night, crying individual
Impossible to fight, can't fight the residual
The calls of the sky, the way we get high
Comin' down like a comet, the fire like wax
Hold it down like vomit, and I'll be right back
They wear a disguise, all they tell you is lies
Even when you look in their eyes, don't be surprised
When you realize everyone of them flies is just a maggot with wings
By and by, you'll understand the sting

You are S-T-U-V
That way you X-Y-Z
You are S-T-U-V
That way you X-Y-Z
That way you X-Y-Z
You are S-T-U-V
One two three, one two three
Get out the way, you make me sick
I'm 'bout to say some crazy shit
Thought I was, but I'm wasting it

Stupid shit, stupid shit, stupid shit
Stupid shit, stupid shit, stupid shit
Stupid shit, stupid shit, stupid shit
Alright, whatever
Alright, whatever

You are S-T-U-V
That way you X-Y-Z
