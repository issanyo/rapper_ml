[Intro]
Why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls
Why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls
(If you're delusional, your call will be transferred to the mother ship)
Ugh! Yes, I like the drugs

[Verse 1]
I'm coming through, thought you knew, fuck if you didn't, fuck you
Plutonium lore, what this is, what this for
Feel my fists push black holes through your bitch ass decor
Spit it back like a whore and make you shit your fucking drawers
Scared to ride, cowards fall before my eyes, sound of my balls
Dragging like cannon loaded wagons, drug by demons down your halls
Can't imagine what's fit to happen when I get to flashing, see the small
Shrink to a fraction of what they're lacking and less than that in no time at all
Can't believe they have the gaul to try and act
Like they’re not trapped between these walls
Bring it (Bring it)
Kill it

[Hook]
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it

[Verse 2]
Sometimes feel like I'm close but never get there, never get there
Does it mean I'm a ghost if I'm still here? Wanna leave here
And if I am why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls
And if I can, were they even ever there at all? Not at all
Too much time spent in the maze will drive you mad, I feel so bad
Been there so long I can't remember who I am, or where I stand
But in the end I guess I just don’t give a damn, twist a gram
And keep on sticking with the original plan, fuck it man
Judge you no more than I wish to be judged, even on the low
But I do know what you do not speak of, don’t know but it shows
Try to hide but I see who you are because I just know
Keep talking but you already said too much, there you go
How it is now's how it always was, that’s on my blood
How it is now's how it always was, that’s on my blood

[Hook]
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit, that shit
Bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit, kill it

[Verse 3]
See my blood spill drip, by chances
Try to chill, quit, cause I can't just slip into a zagthoth trance
Tongue hissing, serpent chants
Come again work it in, yeah just like that
We paint our insides black as the shadows 'hind our flesh
And make all that we lack, the part of life that we forget
All praise due to the fact that we've forgotten how to sweat it
Check it, bring it, kill it
On everything I own, swear would rather slit my throat
And die on the run than be the one who ends up hangin' from that rope
Tied to the thumb of the man who comes to empty your pockets when you choke
Got to get that shit myself and get the fuck out of this game before
I end up getting stuck with no one but myself to blame, all the way insane
Staring at the ceiling, in the dark
Trying not to let the feeling, tear you apart
But the silence is buzzing, and it won't stop
Tell yourself it's almost over, but it's not
