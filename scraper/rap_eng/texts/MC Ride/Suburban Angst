{Intro: Stefan}
He has strawberries on his head

{1: G Rider}
Take what you want, boy, take what you need
Take all your hopes and fill them with weed
Take all your dreams, replace them with sand
Take all your hopes and bury them in land
Go to the beach, go to the ocean
Go to the heat, drink up all your potion
Dive in the water, dive into alcohol
Dive into drugs, dive into all
Drink, drink, drink and smoke, smoke, smoke
Laugh, laugh, laugh and joke, joke, joke
Smile, smile, smile and cry, cry, cry
Live, live, live
Die, die, die

{2:Swank Daddy}
Quarter of a century, still ain't grown enough
[hit the head club?] with a bottle by my bud
Jump by the plane just to feel a little rush
Sure past the limits, sleepwalk till dusk
[?] ride till numb, [?]
Then re-up on some rum, and get this [swanky?] too tough
I'm a [d ride?] nigga, I never get enough
Got something much better, and ya love to call a bus
Smoke fiddles in the air, paper plates and cups
High power game, not critically acclaimed
Don't dance like a clown, put a [?]
You got it twisted, your too easily entertained
You got a little bit of money, don't sell out your name
But [?] boy, you ain't the one to blame
Your momma's [?], all cowards do the same
Just another [?], only temporary [?]
[?] hold on tight, here they come
Your either gonna fight or your gonna run
I put this
