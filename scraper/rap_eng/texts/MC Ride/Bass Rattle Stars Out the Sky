[Refrain]
Everybody anybody anybody everybody
Get off me
Everybody ain't nobody anybody ain't nobody
Get off me
Everybody anybody anybody everybody
Get off me
Everybody ain't nobody anybody ain't nobody
Get off me

[Hook]
Bury two thumbs disappear three eye run among you
Bass rattle stars out the sky
Bury two thumbs disappear three eye run among you
Bass rattle stars out the sky

[Verse 1]
Never not at war torn mystic
Sheddin' bands form of linguistic
Subliminal exit lurk in cryptic
Black google search it won't find shit
Fifth attitude bury all my business

[Hook]
Bury two thumbs disappear three eye run among you
Bass rattle stars out the sky
Bury two thumbs disappear three eye run among you
Bass rattle stars out the sky

[Verse 2]
Chemical leak melts your reef, dry heave crease your knees
Python in your belly, nauseous got the chills
If I take anymore hard beats, split my gills
Draw the blinds, it's time to get-
Can't explain it's a feeling, inhale the moment till I scorch your lips, don't hurt me
This gypsy gallop does you dirty
Peak at three thirty in the morning with your voice in my headquarters and I'll take you there

[Refrain]
Everybody anybody anybody everybody
Get off me
Everybody ain't nobody anybody ain't nobody
Get off me

[Hook]
Bury two thumbs disappear three eye run among you
Bass rattle stars out the sky

[Verse 3]
Sudden death in the west, London connect live and direct
Mad cow on the beat break, me speed lace your senses
Can't think straight, I can't relate, it's all a dream mate, leave a message
I'm slangin' pain in the paint, can't make it stop
Said knock that off, I rep that gutter fly
Come from where you run from hide, ain't no level 'bove this high
Off I rep that gutter fly, off I rep that gutter fly
Bass rattle stars out the sky

[Bridge]
Get off me
Get off me

[Refrain]
Everybody anybody anybody everybody
Get off me
Everybody ain't nobody anybody ain't nobody
Get off me

[Hook]
Bury two thumbs disappear three eye run among you
Bass rattle stars out the sky
Bury two thumbs disappear three eye run among you
Bass rattle stars out the sky
