[Intro]
Argh-argh argh-argh biatch
Argh-argh argh-argh biatch
Argh-argh argh-argh biatch

[Verse 1]
Wanderlust refill this jill
It’s scuzz I’m how to go there still
It’s a shit show (Front row)
Pint of snake blood heat you on one
I am many and we are none
It’s a shit show (Both holes)
I’m a chase a voice a freak man
This a brand not your boy leave man
It’s a shit show (Eyes closed)
Low am I the harm the wrong done
Night to regret till I’m on one
It’s a shit show (Shit show)

[Bridge]
Greaser I need scotch tonight
Slicker her bitch and your wife illness
Demons in my shoes sickly
I came here to lose quickie

[Verse 2]
It’s a shit show
Head for this lap put my hands up
Weightless glisten press the cactus
It’s a shit show (Shit show)
Wink from this way to a live high
Lead when it’s played like it is fry
It’s a shit show (Two holes)
End of you like think you’re worth shit
Secret to throw these old curses
It’s a shit show (Bitch, no!)
This hole’s a break through this new door
Waste of all day of a shit show
It’s a shit show (Front row)
