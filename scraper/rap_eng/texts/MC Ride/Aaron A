[Intro: Swank Daddy]
Fuck
Take all that shit off
It really dont matter

[Verse 1: Swank Daddy]
Don't nobody wanna play, not in here
Percussion by the grave comes from the rear
Too hard to say, too comfortable to fear
She ain't ready to lay between my ears
Intend to spend a night and lose a year
Put it in your life, learn how to steer
Sedated by the lights, losin' my hair
This shit feels so right, don't wanna stare
Can't do nothing twice, we disappear
Nah she don't wanna play, not in here
Finality is so strong, the end is clear
Always a post beyond ,my dear

[Verse 2: Mxlplx (MC Ride)]
Mind tricks consume me
I slip loosely through loop holes, so sew me
Why trip when you see true control go loony?
Ignite the lunacy hiding behind your blinded view
We shine like a diamond jewel
Screams crazy, bruh
Try not to die before you see lady luck
I cordially invite you, bring your favorite truck
We'll drive till we find two ladies we can corrupt
And instruct in the art of how to suck correctly
Let us construct an ark of trust
So empty, we're remote as the darkness after dusk
Do not attempt to touch the harvest
We've carved out of dust
Death to every lover in love with the hearts of crushed
Stepping through the gutter like a barefooted lush
If your a scared motherfucker, hush
Spreading [?], it's a must that we cover freaks with lust
Exit the past into the future
Left you gasping for breath like a loser
Don't test me
