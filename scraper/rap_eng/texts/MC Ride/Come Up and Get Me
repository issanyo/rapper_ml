[Hook]
My stone wall it's on, dog gaze duct taped to the ceiling
Stucco cave make me illi, okay, okay, feel me
I'm in an eight high abandoned building
No daylight, one midnight lamp lit twenty-four seven
Murdered out windows, two exits
Street or nosedive to the next life in seconds
And suicide ain't my stallion
So I'm surrounded
Geiger count it, not goin' out, shit's 'bout to get kamikaze
Fuck a nazi

[Verse 1]
When the world comes knocking
Fuck the world, fuck this body
Know it won't be long now
Feel my nerves wet my brow
Mood in my tomb, red moon heavy
Sling jaw shot, out the window and yell
Come up and get me

[Verse 2]
I'm epiphanic amnesia
I'm in Jimmy Page's castle
I'm off the planet
Echo astral
Vinyl lasso
The Sacto asshole
I'm not down for anything
Fuck around and say anything

[Hook]
My stone wall it's on, dog gaze duct taped to the ceiling
Stucco cave make me illi, okay, okay, feel me
I'm in an eight high abandoned building
No daylight, one midnight lamp lit twenty-four seven
Murdered out windows, two exits
Street or nosedive to the next life in seconds
And suicide ain't my stallion
So I'm surrounded
Geiger count it, not goin' out, shit's 'bout to get kamikaze
Aaaaaah!
Fuck a nazi

[Bridge]
Come up and get me!

[Verse 3]
My life as a fuck
Ain't one thing I don't hate
Tell me my times almost up
I will say, "I can't wait"
Put your gun to my head
I'll blow smoke in your face
Think you got what it takes?
Come up and get me

[Verse 4]
Can't tell, hell in my head
Thirteenth bell; am I dead
Or in asylum? Pill force-fed
Lyin' to myself, all by myself
Strapped down to my bed
Tongue cut out the mouth of reason
And chucked off the river's edge
Think fast: Is it tear gas or fear masked
By figments of my fragmented mind?
Who's my enemy, them or me?
Step to me and you'll die
Grand delusions magnified
Fuck the truth, wastes my time
It's all good, bet; what's that?
Footsteps on the stairs?
Never could rest; they're always there
Who are they? I don't care
I just know they're tryin' to ex me
Give a fuck, come up and get me
