[Intro]
D-d-d-d-destroyer
D-d-destroyer
Destroyer

[Verse 1]
I’m at Glow Bowl, in a wet fuck hole
Where the 1994 hobos throw
69’s and the bitches shout
I’ll fuck you when I wanna hang out
Tell the princess eat shit and die (ownage)
Not in public, hoe, I’m still high
These pigs are crazy, dog
This narc at the dyke bar in a slow car
Looking like a hedgehog
Sluts go sonic (ownage)
Tryna dick your mom and shit
I’ll do anal in the pit
Repulsive as a benched knick
Show your titties and I’ll spit
These chicks are crazy, god

[Pre-Chorus]
Hate you on a fucking whim, turning into you again
These pigs are crazy, dog
Make a god a better man, no one hates you better than
These chicks are crazy, god
You're so amazing, ha

[Chorus]
Ha-ha-ha, bitch
Ha-ha-ha, bitch
(Feel me, feel me, feel me)
(Sensation)
Ha-ha-ha, bitch
(Feel me, feel me, feel, feel me)
Ha-ha-ha, bitch
(Sensation, ha-ha-ha)
Kiss me

[Verse 2]
It’s my Liberace starter kit
Got her hard like Spartacus
Put a bitch under my wing-a-ling-a-lang-lang-lang
Look bitch, fly like thus
Dope man’s dry, oh yeah right
Don’t trip mark, yo this my part
I got green David Letterman’s, dick like zen
Remember when you fainted at the bargain bins
Party time (ownage)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Good news to hell
My Toyota with some bells (ownage)
Pussy so wise
She’s trying to bump two queen drugs right between the eyes
Ownage, ownage, ownage, ownage

[Pre-Chorus]
In a wet fuck hole
With my feet kicked up so my hair can grow
My steeze is crazy, dog
And I’m in bitch house
Talking 'bout how I’m not tryna hang out
Her steeze is crazy, dog
(Who could it be?
W-w-w-who could it be?
W-w-w-who could it be?)
I think I’m crazy, dog
Put a bitch under my wing-a-ling-a-lang-lang-lang
Put a bitch under my wing-a-ling-a-lang-lang-lang
You’re so amazing, ha

[Chorus]
Ha-ha-ha, bitch
Ha-ha-ha, bitch
(Sensation, ha-ha)
Ha-ha-ha, bitch
Ha-ha-ha, bitch
(Sensation, ha-ha)

[Outro]
Doing, doing, doing, doing, gniod, gniod, gniod, gniod
Doing, doing, doing, doing
You're so amazing, ha
