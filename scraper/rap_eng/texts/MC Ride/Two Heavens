[Verse 1]
Single strike, cadence slip
Once I'll make you my bitch
(I'm on my way out)
We don't want, we take shit
Hella zeros life elixir drenched
(I'm on my way out)
All I need is my fix
Fuck your idols, suck my dick

[Hook]
I'm on my way out
(Pressin' down the pillow 'til I can't hear you breathin'
For no reason)
I'm on my way out
(Pressin' down the pillow 'til I can't hear you breathin'
For no reason)
I'm on my way out
(Pressin' down the pillow 'til I can't hear you breathin'
For no reason)
I'm on my way out
(Pressin' down the pillow 'til I can't hear you breathin'
For no reason)
I'm on my way out
Five rings on my hand

[Verse 2]
Faces gag
Where the fuck's my true ones at?
Wavin' high burnin' freak fuck flags
Takes one to no one knows how fucked I am
If I showed 'em, they'd just run like hoes
Fuck these pussies on hella zeros
Two heavens is all I know

[Hook]
I'm on my way out
(Pressin' down the pillow 'til I can't hear you breathin'
For no reason)
I'm on my way out
(Pressin' down the pillow 'til I can't hear you breathin'
For no reason)
I'm on my way out
(Pressin' down the pillow 'til I can't hear you breathin'
For no reason)
I'm on my way out
(Pressin' down the pillow 'til I can't hear you breathin'
For no reason)
I'm on my way out
Five rings on my hand
