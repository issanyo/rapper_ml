[Hook]
I got some shit to say, just for the fuck of it
Them things, them things, don't even ask me
I got some shit to say, just for the fuck of it
Them things, them things, don't even ask me
I got some shit to say, just for the fuck of it
Them things, them things, don't even ask me
I got some shit to say, just for the fuck of it
Them things, them things, don't even ask me

[Verse 1]
Corner of my eye
The coroner's here; why?
Under pressure
I
My back bone slip left to the death
Massive procession of cold sweat
Stalactite step slide through, you're next
Get me inside I'll do the rest
(Them things, them things, don't even ask me)
Master of self-contained combust
Sustained disgust, command him claim
Figure eight strut, can't be touched
Subversive infiltration reign supreme in none me trust
Why must them? Fuck them
Mine vomit stain them, feel not but hate them
Line up back facin', suspense rapes them
One by one hot cum shot clip spray them
Life drop and waste them in pine box laid them to
Grime dismantled, churn the fat
Light the candle, burn the wax
Before me dies, in scorch uprise
Can't deny it, no way back

[Hook]
I got some shit to say, just for the fuck of it
Them things, them things, don't even ask me
I got some shit to say, just for the fuck of it
Them things, them things, don't even ask me
I got some shit to say, just for the fuck of it
Them things, them things, don't even ask me
I got some shit to say, just for the fuck of it
Them things, them things, don't even ask me

[Verse 2]
Invoke ancient locc to the brain in a blaze ignition weightless world
Warped rotation, path is blurred
Memento mori, dead man's curve
Oblivion transcender becomes him shroud
I can't remember, I'm no one now
Comin' for yours, lock your doors
Identifier: destroyer
Come on, stick me, cut me, drain me, suck me, drink me, take me down
Feel me one three make your pumping chamber pound and drown

[Hook]
I got some shit to say, just for the fuck of it
Them things, them things, don't even ask me
I got some shit to say, just for the fuck of it
Them things, them things, don't even ask me
I got some shit to say, just for the fuck of it
Them things, them things, don't even ask me
I got some shit to say, just for the fuck of it
Them things, them things, don't even ask me

[Outro]
Bear the mark
Take one to know
Lifted chin
Face don't show
