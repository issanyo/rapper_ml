[Hook]
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States

[Verse 1]
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
Everything rigged at this place, it's not me
Don’t break my concentration with those thoughts baby
I don’t care about real life, I don’t care about real life
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
Everything rigged at this place, it's not me
Don’t break my concentration with those thoughts baby
I don’t care about real life, I don’t care about real life

[Verse 2]
Feel just like I look to you
Gawk at me all you see is you
Anyday trip, mayday trip
Can’t break my face, I’m in a state trip
Feel just like I look to you
Gawk at me all you see is you
Anyday trip, mayday trip
Can’t break my face, I’m in a state trip

[Verse 3]
Spit on you, spit on me
All we know spit must be us
Spit fits us, we spit and sniff
We sniff and clutch each other’s fate
I don’t care about real life, I don’t care about real life

[Hook]
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I don’t care about real life, I don’t care about real life
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States

[Outro]
Too many mirrors share my face
Can’t braille which mirrors my mistake
Too many mirrors wear my face
These broken mirrors take my place
I don’t care about real life
Too many mirrors share my face
Can’t braille which mirrors my mistake
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
