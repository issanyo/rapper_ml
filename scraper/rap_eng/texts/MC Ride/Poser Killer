[Hook]
Poser killer, poser killer, poser killer (Schwa)
Poser killer, poser killer, poser killer (Stop)

[Verse]
When you start talking, I don't listen
I just wait for you to finish
And when you're done I'll say, "That's crazy"
"Really?" "oh" "yeah" but lately
I don't reply
You been denied
Sometimes I smile, sometimes I moan, sometimes I look away and nod
Sometimes I give no reply and watch your ice break like a jaw
Don't  waste your breath, the time was over before it started
When you arrived, I had already departed
(Now you know I'm-)
Walk on by
Crashed and burned
Forever rocking that worm
Called the worm
Just got high
Klepto war hand on the ride
Never answer when they hit me; why?
Never matter, pass on the lie
'Bout what happens after we die
Dust to ash, ashes to malt
Ghost all black, control the zone
The troll is threshed, I'm forced to ride
Lock your door
Argent clear
All the dead is souls galore
We just got spit in your eyes
Rabid dogs off the leash
From man to man as we beef
Get the fuck out of that Jeep
All hell leave I lead the sting
(Now you know I'm ready)
So love battle
Took the mantle
From the dogs who want more beef
For the law, code of the streets
With every oomph, we'll sue the pigs

[Hook]
Poser killer, poser killer, poser killer, (schwa)
Poser killer, poser killer, poser killer, (stop)

[Outro]
Reload the barrel and creep like a wolf among sheep
See how we bum-rush the weak
Brush them guts with our feet
Can't knock the asphalt, coded mystique
Crack the code, unlock the vault, make off with all that we seek
It's death, death, death....
