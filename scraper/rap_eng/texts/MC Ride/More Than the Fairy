[Intro]
More than the fairy
More than the fairy

[Hook]
More than the fairy
Go make that face
Go make that bass
Go make that face, go
More than the fairy
Make that face
Go make that face
Go make that bass
More than the fairy
Go make that face
Go make that bass
Go make that face, go
More than the fairy
Make that face
Go make that bass
Go make that face

[Verse 1]
I got my hands on this bitch
Impressed with me, all of these insects
Act as if I never meant to
I never meant to be soft
I sent you texts then it filled you with those
And it must bass

[Bridge 1]
I know it sounds crazy at the river bank
Ain't thought 'bout shit for a minute, mane
Mane

[Verse 2]
Twice the thickness Nyquil
Limited discount time kill
I'm here for 24 hours
Letdowns line up like coward
Amnesia put the address
Express level crash test
You tell me I can't call it
All I do is talk shit

[Refrain]
More than the fairy

[Hook]
More than the fairy
Go make that face
Go make that bass
Go make that face, go
More than the fairy
Make that face
Go make that bass
Go make that face
More than the fairy
Go make that face
Go make that bass
Go make that face, go
More than the fairy
Make that face
Go make that bass
Go make that face

[Verse 3]
Forged all my signatures, blah blah blah
Strangled from this track of smoke rising
Hard to see 'em proper
Tried to swallow his only pills, though

[Bridge 2]
Mane

[Verse 4]
Ungluing my person in this city strapped with strange lies
Reluctantly searching for what eluded me last night
Perfectly for decades
Bully ain't trapped that trip yet
Put this life behind me
But I know that's just a half step

[Outro]
Make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
