[Intro]
Finn: “Who was that?”
Jake: “The princess of the Fire Kingdom!”
Finn: “Dude…I think I have a crush!"

[Sample]
Hair piled up, piled up high
Your hair piled up, piled up high

[Verse 1]
I see your face, stress starts to erase
Just like the fear and the cold and the hate
I guess feelings are starting to shape
And for once I don't want to escape
I'd much rather embrace, smell the flowers
Wrap the moon and stars around us, make the night ours
Can't you feel the power?
Every single part of you is the opposite of sour
Cause you're sweet from the head to the feetsies
And I love the way that you greet me
I know it's weak see, how these words defeat me
But I'm so completely lost in you, lost in the thought
That for once in my life my heart might go soft
And stop this manic damage that got me up in panics
Erupting with life like volcanic organic
Well let's make this last
We're accustomed to the custom that time moves too fast
Living no fear and no consequence
Looking at the change, hope that it makes sense
This is the minute and second where we own it
Let's get lost in the moment
No time for opponents
Let's just bask in the moment

[Sample]
You’re a flower, you’re a river, you’re a rainbow
You’re a flower, you’re a river, you’re a rainbow

[Verse 2]
At home inside the gaze of your eyes
Allowing someone to take a look inside
And calm washes over, turning watches over
Drunk off affection like I'm not sober
Finally dear I'm clearly
On my own for the first time nearly
I'll admit I'm smitten by the mystery
I live inside lines of unwritten history
But ink is written, me on my scribe shit
I'm grooving to these raps, I really hope you vibe with me
I think you're one of a kind
I think I'm on your mind, I think I'm on my mind
It's like, “Girl do you mind if I repeat that line?"
And if you wanna slow it down I'm like, “Yeah, that's fine"
No cut me off
I'm done with brushing off, I'm brushing up
I think you caught me blushing, cause I think you're cool and stuff
The feeling's resounding, the interest's compounding
By my account it's astounding
How the whole feeling inside’s just building like mountains
And hey it’s building like mountains
And no I can't move those
But I'll try to make you move if I can get you close

[Sample]
You’re a flower, you’re a river, you’re a rainbow
You’re a flower, you’re a river, you’re a rainbow
