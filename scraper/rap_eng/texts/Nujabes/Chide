[Intro]
(She tell me why tell me why, tell me) x8

[Hook] x2
She tell me why, tell me why
Why when I try she only can let it die
Die, what am I, my truth can never lie
My lie is the truth, inside you can rely

[Verse 1: Cons3pt]
She tell me why, tell me why
She don’t ever look at me wit a spark in her eye
I see you an I is just pie in the sky
Pie in the sky, thats why, im tryna fly
You never see, never see
I see you and me talking before A to B
Properly positioned out life, forming what we
By we I mean you, thinks we may never be

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Cons3pt]
Take a little time off your mental
Don’t you think it’s so coincidental
That i’m using a dental, to murk an instrumental
The same way I think having you is just so influential (uh)
Fluently flowing like it’s the nile river
I know you can feel it so now it’s now or never
Never the everlasting discography
We make wit every single we screaming at so flawlessly
I cannot sustain, are you to blame?
Every picture we painting don’t ever fit in a frame
Of mind our minds intertwine in decline
Stressing our blessings until we can decline
Controversial convo’s till the time lapse
The truth in our speeches until we relapse
I tell you don’t worry trouble is troublesome
Then I double the trouble until you notice the double sum
Huh, she blow the top of my top back
Yea, she lift me up till I drop back
She only rely on my revelations
Is it shocking that despite it she limits my limitations
They only title us in a catastrophe
Destruct our reconstruction our corruption is a blasphemy
Even though it’s in my eyes so fuego
But it’s you that make me wanna break an go so lego

[Hook] x4

[Outro]
(She tell me why tell me why, tell me) x4
Yea, Go, Uh, Flow
