Straightening out my four in hand, blank face, no date to go and dance
Butterfingers holding onto chance, disenchanted, guess nothing goes according to plan
Your standards, my direction, no emotions up for detection
Two-timing almost to your deception, courage from all of those rejections
It's twisted, is what you got, coincidentally it's also the plot
To be honest, I'm tired of your dramas, karma's coming I promise, can't stop it
Pen's down, start it again, amend for all my past disrespect
Bullshit as usual, you know how it is, plug the headphones in, let your mind drift
A cumulus, carefree pacifist, swinging his legs, over the ledge
Flirty texts in the middle of lectures, black textas, red flag my conjectures
I'm not interested anymore, acting as if no girl's ever liked me before
'Eureka!' it's a discovery, tearful apologies proving hypotheses
On the odyssey to adulthood, catch up 'how you been' yeah it's all good
Remember back when chandeliers full course?
Socially awkward was too forced
Too loud, decibels got me turned down
Appreciate it bros knowing all the know-hows
Refining, wait for the timing, being on deck, 'thank you ladies and gentlemen', yeah enough said
