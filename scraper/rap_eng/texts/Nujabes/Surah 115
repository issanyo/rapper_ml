[Verse 1]
Ain’t it amazin’, my parents were first generation
It’s such a long way from the village you was raised in
Not bad for immigrants to become physicians that manufactured my spaceship
And I’m so grateful cuz you dropped me off on a block
Never swallowed by darkness of gangs and gun shots
But things are changing ‘cause this new kid in town named Haas
They don’t believe him but his tongue is a Glock that never stops spittin’
They listen to my transmission, ‘cause I order an exodus
Of every wack cat, I grab my weapon and I load it
Exodia when I put it together
The power level I’m takin’ over is completely bogus
My tongue finally in focus I’m
Sprayin’ shots completely sober no vodka
The knock on me was I had no pop in my voice
They don’t know since a yougin’ I mastered my lung’s chakra
But that’s just a baby step in the breath, lump in my throat is immense
I’m meant to flow with this slobber but my mouth won’t spit it out
I pass out talkin’ to my most precious thoughts
This must be the death of me
‘Cause without y’all the only thing left of me is a monster
But this life is just a big dream
Inside me inside me I defeated every monster
Only then did I wake up at a concert
Is this real I spin the totem confirming that I am conscious
I hear a calling from above tellin’ me I got the see to heal the world
Your skill with the words can plant it and watch it grow
Till it stretch across the whole globe
It’s buried in your intellect and soul, you got to find it
I spit this seed of truth to the youth
Embeded in your mind it’s
So contagious I can hardly sustain it on mosh pit at a time
This seed don’t need light only enlightenment from above
Still they claimin’ that I’m soft ‘cause I preach unity and love to y’all
I’m just a messenger on a mission from God
If a non-believer wanna stunt, he can take it up with Allah

[Bridge]
Surah 115
The lost passage
Surah 115

[Verse 2]
But on another note
I’m bumpin Jay Elect full blast in my hover boat
Harnessing enough key(ki) to access other world
Witness the artisan harvestin’ centuries of truth
Buried by bandits and under borrows
They backstab your country with a wound that my words will bandage
Only the coldest can un-decode it and face the underworld
Where elitist retreat during’ the sacking of their fortress
In ruins I found a mattress and squeezed out every asset
Till my flow reign from Karachi to Nazareth
On top Nawaz Sherif sleeping with a devil who hit his knees at the first passage
Read him Surah 115 now he bout to take Shahada
Took a glimpse of heaven and the flow had to re-banish him
My dialect is truly damagin’ to any that stand in my way
I know the powers comin’ I just pray I don’t mismanage it
The leader you see in the speeches is just a manikin of hope
That will never trickle down to the village that you famished in
The people sandwiched in grief ‘cause
You’ll make ‘em believe anything, when your throne is in jeopardy
My condolences will increase the longevity in the soul of the slums you brew
Break the cast(e) that you shackled in
I can touch the souls of untouchables
The rhythm will align a world commanded by the
Most talented slaves to ever touch the earth
For those born at the top that’s hard to swallow
Like legalizing abortion, and
The greatest crime drop ever to follow
My art is maturing from mixtapes to the birth of albums, I
Guess that’s pro-choice
I’m morning for babies born in mother that don’t want ‘em
But if you are born then I’ll be your voice
For kids surrounded by darkness who believe breakin’ the law is your only way out
I’ll bring it out from within you like the heart of the prophet
Cleansed on the avenue of imagination
You see my heart is just a magnet I’m connecting with the masses
My goal is to make you understand the madness
Of a world where we not born equal but equally blessed
I wanna speak for the poor
But even the richest man has a mind so unexplored
Untap your potential help me guide your blessings on course
This world is fucked up but it’s yours

(Beat switches)

The inspiration I conduct is endorsed
By the most delicate balance of love and fear
My god is the fuel
But the pilot and engineer of this massage is hope
The recipe to inject, the blessed essence up into your soul
The truth is a, never dying virus accept your mind as the host
See the, battle against evil is off the mind and I’m a soldier at war
So the meek shall inherit the earth
If not today then tomorrow, if the past is a lesson
The flow is a combination I borrowed
From every one of the greatest
You have now witness their, reincarnation
Awaken From Hibernation
Awaken From Hibernation
Awaken From Hibernation
