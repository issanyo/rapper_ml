Gotta free your mind x4

Gotta free your mind
I guarantee you will love the freedom
So c'mon and take a bite from a piece of mine
I swear on my life, it's a gift
It's delicious
Pick it up and have a taste
Then maybe you'll be the witness
I- gotta free your mind
Lose everything you've ever been taught
A new start when you realize
Love
It's the only thing we control
So open up to loving one-and-other
And make a note you..
Gotta free your mind
A brand new way of thinking. Something different
But it's something we need to find
Cause nine times out of ten, my pigment
Will get me judged different then other kids
So let me try to remind you we
Gotta free our minds
Bout to revive the Renaissance when i rhyme
Right now, is the time to re-design
Inventors, Creators, Visionaries
The one's who ain't gon give up
We'll save the world from becoming blind

No need for an introduction, speed is the reason why
I was given these long legs. All day, ima be running
Lost all hope but I found it when i was nothing
Stuck at the bottom and turned around and I made it something
Nobody would ever waste a breath
To tell me what i've been through
Cause nobody's ever spent a day in my shoes
Seven billion human beings so confused
If what we're doing is dividing
I promise we're only going to lose
A fuse we built so filled up with power
Stronger than any man
In the wrong hands could devour
What little civilization we have left in an hour
I can see the battle coming from the top of the tower
Now, gotta figure out a method to stop the madness
Unless we can block the damage
Or patch this up with a bandage
I promise it's gonna be tragic when this collapses on top of us
Ironically moving forward is only stopping us
Unfortunate for myself, a phony is popular
And i'm about the furthest guy from it
No doubt, I'm not about to let this whole world plummet
I've been through hell
But i learned how to walk through the flames and rise above it
We gotta make sure that we stick together
Cause i know, you know, right now, things are more fucked up then ever
No matter the weight, size, shape, face, or the color
We're all apart of the same human race and there ain't no other
