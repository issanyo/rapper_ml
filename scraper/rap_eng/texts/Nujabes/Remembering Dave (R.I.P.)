[Verse 1]
Seems like yesterday me and my man was chilling
Kept a smile on his face no matter how he was feeling
Why is it that the good are the first to go
Word is bond sun my heart can't take no more
I be trying to maintain but the pain is a strain
Memories of dave forever stain my brain
So you'll never be forgotten shirts with your name on it
They gonna be rocking til they're mildewed and rotten
Coping with you passing on has been rough
It even brought tears to eyes of guys that played tough
So we're thinking about you from lunar to soular
Can't believe we came so close but yet so far
What did you have to die for it hurts more
When i think of all the things that you had in store
Cause that latter of success you were steadily climbing
When you began rhyming you were shining like a diamond
And you just started now you're dearly departed
I'm feeling heavy hearted and i can't disregard it
Whenever i rhyme i can feel you in me
Now you're in a better place to watch over us and Jimmy

[Hook]
Why do we live and die
Why do we flip then cry
When we all know that nothing is forever on this earth
We try to cure the hurt though it seems nothing really works
Why do we live and die
Why do we flip then cry
When we all know that nothing is forever on this earth
We try to cure the hurt though it seems nothing really works

[Verse 2]
Mother's day morning when it all occured
Remember when i first heard i thought that it was obscurd
And it couldn't be true anybody but you
Sun you had so many unfinished things to do
And to call him talented was an understatement
You could wait around for years and never find a replacement
They'll never be another who can take his place
I know his fam would give anything to see his face
It's so hard to say goodbye yet so easy to go
And before you know we will soon follow
To the otherside when this brother dies
Man it hurt in side when i heard his brother's cries stand strong
Why did death have to pick you and come and get you
Best believe as long as we breath we'll still miss you
Every single day someone else is deceased
I done lost my pops, my uncles, my niece
My grandfather, friends and i'm possibly next
It feels like we're born to die and it's getting me vexed
DJ if you're watching be my armor through the drama
Because it don't cease David Ross rest in peace!

[Hook x2]
Why do we live and die
Why do we flip then cry
When we all know that nothing is forever on this earth
We try to cure the hurt though it seems nothing really works
Why do we live and die
Why do we flip then cry
When we all know that nothing is forever on this earth
We try to cure the hurt though it seems nothing really works
