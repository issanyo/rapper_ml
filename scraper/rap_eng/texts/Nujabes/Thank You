[Verse 1]
It's been a long time coming and I'm still not there almost to Japan
Just got to get into the air, then off the ground can't wait but kind of scared
To float among the clouds, suspended 12 rounds [?] but I'm bound for destiny
Saving grace from insanity but chose to flow fuck the gold publishing and bounce on from the soul MC from Atlantic [?]... sounds good to me
Coach class after my birthday pass blast off for unknown territory que sera
Whatever I suggest I'm the distinguished guest, I'm blessed any wishes, last minute requests?
Quench my needs, it's almost unreal all the things I'm seeing
Makes me appreciate all God's human beings
In a special way, some things that a rhyme can't say, let me start from the heart
I just want to state

[Hook]
I thank you all for showing love to me
I appreciate this unique opportunity
I'm gonna rock so hard so you never stop supporting me
I'm gonna show you how music brings more meaning to life
I thank you all for showing love to me
I appreciate this unique opportunity
I'm gonna rock so hard so you never stop supporting me
I'm gonna show you how music brings more meaning to life

[Verse 2]
It's an intimidating task, flipping the crafts [?] making magic over and over
I take a stab at it as a ritual, Predicting to the operation the attraction is spiritual
Rap is habitual have me feeling higher than a sentinel, damn I'm strung on it, who would have thunk it
That when I first begun it for fun, writing rhymes to stack em' one by one, now I'm iller than radiation
Plan on keep spitting til' I'm cremated, reincarnated then became my name at the top keeping focused like a spotlight
Staying up all night writing rhymes by starlight, real deep with it
20, 000 leagues beneath the hype, I'm impotent, intimate, same with life, twists and turns, perks and achievements
I get home back I'm speaking because it needs to be heard I know I have power so I use it to infuse my words

[Hook]
I thank you all for showing love to me
I appreciate this unique opportunity
I'm gonna rock so hard so you never stop supporting me
I'm gonna show you how music brings more meaning to life
I thank the fans for showing love to to me
And I respect the fact that you always keep it real with me
It keeps me sensitive when I need to feel lyrically [?]
The desire for my insight gives me reason to write

[Verse 3]
I still can't believe it I'm stunned
Land of the rising sun, here I come
I'm here, next stop lower eastern hemisphere
Hip hop's hot all around the globe
Witness culture unfold before me
Absorb it in and write the story, corny as it sounds it makes me want to cry
I was born chosen to live this life, one soul [?]
Worlds to explore I'm going down undercover me fans won't abandon me
Trainers [?] love me I get my own stage, feel the sound brutality
I'm 1000 miles away so things a rhyme can't say let me start from the heart and sincerely state
Thank You

[Hook]
I thank you all for showing love to me
I appreciate this unique opportunity

I'm gonna show you how music brings more meaning to life
I thank the fans for showing love to to me
And I respect the fact that you always keep it real with me
It keeps me sensitive when I need to feel lyrically [?]
The desire for my insight gives me reason to write

I thank you all for showing love to me
You make this journey something that I hold close to me
I see hip hop as a global community
It makes sense that music brings more meaning to life
I thank you all for showing love to me
