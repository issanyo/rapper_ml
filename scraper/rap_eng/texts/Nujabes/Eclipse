[Hook]
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waiting for the day we touch
Your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waiting for the day we touch
Your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner

[Verse 1: Substantial]
Do you honestly believe I'd turn my back on you and leave my true love all alone in this cruel world?
When every single solitary day I do my best to secure a future for me and you girl
Cause it IS all about you, It's been all about you
Seconds feel like millenniums when I'm without you
But my momma said there be days like this and ain't jack we can do
That's the way life is

But it's been weeks since I felt your lips and I'm a fiend for my queen so I need a fix
Only for now I'll settle for these talks on the phone
But I cut my arm off for a moment alone
With the one that I cherish whether in Rome or Paris, Amsterdam or Japan
Please note that I am thinkin' bout my baby as much as humanly possible
An' I know you're frustrated cause life has too many obstacles

[Hook]
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waiting for the day we touch
Your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waiting for the day we touch
Your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner

[Verse 2: Substantial]
My dear my dear my dear I know you're lonely
An' I know very well that it's hard and it hurts but there's no need to cry
Cause I will be home soon and there ain't no limit to the things that we goin' do
Whatever you want name it and I'll make it reality
To see my baby's face nothin' means more than that for me
This is far from flattery I ain't trying to impress you
Truth is I miss you and I'm hurtin' internally
Sometimes these long trips feel like eternity
But they say distance makes the heart grow fonder
And in this case it's proven to be fact
So I'll be back like a T100

From blocks away you will see me comin'
With the biggest smile you ever seen on my face
Cause even the toughest man on the planet needs lovin'
There's nothin' tame the wild like a woman's embrace

[Hook]
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waiting for the day we touch
Your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waiting for the day we touch
Your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner

[Verse 3: Substantial]
Feels like it's been forever and I can't wait to see ya
It's like wit' Bonnie and Clyde, Tony and Maria
Romeo and Juliet, Akeem and Lisa
Basically inseparable and it's more than sexual

Withstand every shell Tell me don't you like the sound of that?
Got my heart racing and about to have a heart attack
Wantin' to be loved by you just you
There's nobody loves you like I do
And I ain't scared to show it
But these feelings are hard to put into words
And I'm a poet slash MC
So give me credit for expressing them
Because writin' this was more nervous than I ever been

I had to get it out for when I'm unable to sit with you
You have a little song that I wrote for you to listen to
So you know the way that you're missin' me I'm missin' you
I wanna give you the world but for now I hope this'll do
