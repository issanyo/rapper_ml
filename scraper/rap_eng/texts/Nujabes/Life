[Chorus]
This is the life man you live and you fall
If you lucky then you live and you ball
If  you don’t get up and move forward every time that you down
Than my nigga you ain't livin at all
In the world it seems to be more then a dream
But these dreams of reality have gotten to me
But i still move on just for  me to believe it
My time to go then it's times to  recieve it

[Verse 1: Zero]
Just a kid, all he wanted was his father
But baby mama drama so his father never bothered
Always ducking rocks.... so it seems
That life is taking shots at this young black teen

Niggas taking  him down cause they want to be the baddest
Daily routine when niggas want to be a badasss
Harsh words heard been getting to him mentally
It funny how school was never quite elementary

But Watson you should watch him cause in his mind unwinds
He be on some shit, the order of columbine
It’s always so easy to look back at the warnings signs
Dark kid  fine line, blowin up  land mine

Because i'm fed up
And you don’t know me don’t judge  this my life so you can shut up
Living life .....fuck the fame and the glory
I'm absolute zero and I will live to tell the story

[Chorus]

To be clear I ain’t advocating violence
Koyyaaniquattsii living life no balance
Lupe told me that the game is the belly of the beast
Blunts for fingers and hollow tips for teeth

But if hollow tips could speak they would have told you that ain't fair
Cause niggas don’t use words round here
And aaaaaaa is life what it seems, if so I’m living my American dream
Eat steak and cake then marry a beauty queen, then do a dive into a pool of the green

And i leave the house extra fly
Because no corporation never told me no lie
An I have a million followers
Do a business owner who makes a billion dollars
You know how that be, just the simple things to make a niggas happy
