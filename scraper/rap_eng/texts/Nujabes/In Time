Intro: All I think about is you

Verse 1: (Corinthian)

Back in the day when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Me and this girl
Best of friends from my hood
Cause we both understood
Each others life and we would
Have the Coolest things to do
And the coolest ways to play
Everyday When I was with this girl around the way
We played using our imagination
Building forts and folklore
Living with no rules on a planet
That we hoped for
Since The first grade
I had the biggest crush on her
But I let time fade
And then it didn't occur
I should of tried to fight harder
Just to win her over
I should of thought smarter
But then We both got older
Then I see you in this new day and age
You made vows
I'm like wow
But im so happy and proud
But still you my best friend
Deep In my heart somewhere
So when you need me
You Just call and I will be there

Hook: (Jhamasa, Jasmine Dukes, Jayla Lyons)

In time When you need me
I will come all the way
In time I will be there
Through the night through day
In due time till the end
I will always come to you
In time you're my best friend
More than time that you ever knew

Verse 2: (Jhamasa)

It's kind of funny now I'm older and we all grown up
As I'm reaching for the future
But the past I'm Stuck
In that love situation
Everything was right
Then it all went wrong
But still I longed the fight
I thought we both would be the ones
Until the end of the world
Then you let my hand go
And Now I'm just that girl
Lost in time and space
Scar of age on my face
But I'm younger than I'm destined to approach my fate
In the middle of it all as I'm growing Some more
And in time of my circle I'll define the core
As the meaning of the journey
That I want you back
Or should I just move on
Into another time zone
Where everything is new
And my life's refreshed
God forgiven all my sins
Now in time I'm blessed
But no matter where I go
In these times until the end
I'm your friend and you call me
If you need me again

Hook: (Jhamasa, Jasmine Dukes, Jayla Lyons)

In time When you need me
I will come all the way
In time I will be there
Through the night through day
In due time till the end
I will always come to you
In time you're my best friend
More than time that you ever knew
