[Sample: Luiz Bonfá - “The Shade of the Mango Tree”]

[Verse 1: Cise Starr]
Crush a coal to a diamond, eyes forever shining
Your beauty alone inspire a nigga to rhyming
Thinking of the better things in life, thinking of
How I could persuade you to become my wife
Hand in hand as we floating over tropical sands
You my lady, I'm your man, so let's further advance to the
Next scene: me sleeping next to you, resting
You're the personification of all God's blessings
Coming to me in just one physical being
One physical dream that I wanna redeem
You're voluptuous, sweet, caramel-brown, honeydew
Satin skin smooth to the touch; What a nigga do?
So sensual, her smile like a chemical
Extract of perfection, rare mineral
She smell like a happy birthday on a Thursday
Quiet time; love, sleep in;  I’ll wake early

[Hook: Cise Starr]
Honey brown with the long, black hair
Teasing me with a kiss and a stare
Slight touch and you’re taking me there
So fine and it just ain't fair
So beautiful and so damn rare

[Verse 2: Cise Starr]
She's angelic and energetic, using sex as a weapon
I reckon that I'm confessing her body is just a blessing
From God down to Earth, she needs to be in a church
To prove we didn't spawn from fish, but God's work
Hurts to see her clothed ‘cause her body beholds
Secrets untold, valued like platinum and gold, for she is
The key to open my mind to see
The energy that radiates from the gates of heavenly bliss
I reminisce over touch and a kiss
While you fucking a bitch, I go to make love to my miss
Never scandalous, it's unanimous that the hue will handle it
Lights off and candle-lit rooms are glamorous
Yo, I’ll call you love, sexual; You look edible
Parallel, snuggle up close, intellectual
In a rendezvous, push you a rap hairdo
No makeup, in jean shorts, open-toed shoe
I want to hold you, mold your soul.  I’ll behold you
Know you better than myself, never own you
But keep you, never leave you; I’ll beseech you
God’s gift to man is you wearing a see-through
Riding Sea-Doos in Atlantic Ocean, causing commotion
Lay you down, going through the motions
Keep your skin soft, lotions got me coasting
Down, pretty, brown, round, thighs, the candles low-lit

[Hook: Cise Starr]
Honey brown with the long, black hair
Teasing me with a kiss and a stare
Slight touch and you’re taking me there
So fine and it just ain't fair
So beautiful and so damn rare

[Verse 3: Cise Starr]
Look at this agreeable, delightful, delectable
Unforgettable, so sweet she may be edible
She needs a pedestal to step out of heaven—you ready, boo?
Never hypothetical, you factual and magical
Fuck theatrical, baby girl, because you actual
Physically, your chemistry is so mathematical
Had to use academics to define your spirit
You lifting my limits; Your name off of my tongue is a lyric
She's a compilation of my mind’s representation
Of a representative representing an excellent revelation
Of time and dedication (She will)
Never impatient (For real)
She know the deal, (reveal) herself to me
So I can see her heavenly ways, her heavenly gaze
And, plus, it don't hurt that she has an ass for days
So as we lay, I reminisce on the day that we met
Please, God, never let me forget...
