[Verse]
Lately I've been thinking about myself
Wondering about the future
Thinking about my wealth

Can't wait until next new year
Naruto on the shelf
And that one piece

If I spend my life chasing it
Then how's it gonna be

I don't know if I'm wasting it
But when will I see

Living life 3D ain't DBZ
And I ain't SS3

All eyes on me are in a mirror

Stained by dried water
And I just wish that it was clearer

I've been drowning all of my emotions in my soma
But I know I'm just talking
Thats opposite of my persona

And that's why there's no Bulma
I'm Vegeta as a loner

Galick gunning
Everyone out the picture
Like I don't want em

I'm boosting
I know I want her

I'm tripping
I'm not the vulnerable

This is stupid
This back and forth with my self

But I do it all the time
And i know that I'd be lying
If I said
I ain't want someone as mine
I peep her everyday
And inside I be crying

Cause I'm afraid to say a word
How do I approach her
We've been friends for too long
Still I barely even know her

No idea of what to say
So I why bother with rehearsal

I'll have to take chance on this ark
Like Noah



Now it's time for me
To plan my m**f** future
My artistic mind is making rhymes
That now you are not used to
And I don't give a f*** about
Non rappers in the past
Success is in my future
And you all can kiss my a**
Everyday I'm writing music
I jotted this down in class
And i might not even use it
So I hope that I can pass
This is musical domination
The whole world will feel my wrath




Two roads diverged in a wood
And I ain't pick one

Should it be the one less traveled by
Or the one most stumbled on

What did you stumble upon
This music has got you twisted

Now your changing the image
Of the future that you envisioned

And reckoning's in the current
I guess I'll have to change the current

I only see two options
All the other ones are foreign

I guess I'll be ford exploring
Until I'm flying in that foreign

But first I need to awaken
I cannot stay dormant

Trying to broaden my horizons
And expand my mind

But I don't understand myself
So I'm wasting my time

Only interested
When I'm waiting in line

Before I'm in the front
It's I'm wasting my time

Or I'm wasting my breath
But for now I'll be fine





Stay focused
You get off track with those emotions
This is a one way street
You aren't ready for the ocean

You're always choking
Struggling with devotion
You need to put that s*** in check
Like a colon

Absorb the water
Your eyes have secreted

You will always fail
But remember you succeeded

Channel your energy
And propel when you reach zenith

And just like Goro
You will never be defeated

You'll continue to win
Endlessly
Win you emit the energy

Of Kakashi and Broly
A legendary
Super Saiyan
With Chidori

And the Sharinghan Eye
Whenever haters talk
Kamui them aside

And pull the Husk
Out the dust

When they try
To hurt your pride

They're trying to get you to sin
Cause they're envious you height
And money

Greedy for power
They're lusting for your bucks

But

These gluttons
Are filling up
Because they're scared to feel your punch

So watch your back
Not even a sloth
Would go for that

Act fast
When they attack
Just let them feel your wrath
