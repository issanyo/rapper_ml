[Verse 1]
Life is a dream
I levitated just to get outta bed
I wanted the smell of roses level beneath my head
We fly in the sky just looking for a home
We're birds
We either packs or we soar alone
But this isn't the type of song that'll get you to think about the negativity
This is the song that you drink to and fly away

Now let's go back
Cause now a smile is nothing but a phase
But being pure as a child
Don't you remember the days?
Yeah
When dying in a game was the reality
When hanging with your childhood friends, figuring faculties
These are the days that I cherish
Like way before I knew that innocence could just perish
Dreaming about being a hero
A super one at that
Not thinking about dineros
Or dollars or pounds
Forget the Yen
I am all about Zen
I remember back then
I used to think that I was Spider-Man
The first black web swinger
In New York and Japan
My fantasies are on a milli
But really
I think we think too much about the deep
And maybe I'm just a hypocrite
But what I do know is we can be who we want to be
Now nod your head if you feeling me

[Verse 2]
Ricochet adrenaline
Bouncing off the walls with the dreams I ain't keeping in
I ain't boutta dream with my eyes closed
Your fellow alien ninja
Best remind me this the life that I chose
And I don't know why I'm here
But I know that I rose
An undiscovered being
Feel the peace from my toes
I think that I am here to show you this outlook
Your body's a clam
And the pearl is the beauty from the sand
Treasure while you can

As the beat go low
I want you to sit back and let time go slow
Let loose of the impeccable
Cause ain't nobody perfect
The freedom of your mind is well deserving
That's all we need
And I know that we've earned it
Rewriting the code of what we used to
Nowadays, almost everything remains taboo
Go forth, an intermission
Listen to the vibrations from a legend
Nujabes, you a King
I lift up my fist and ring
And I know from the sky you'd be proud too

I finna dance my way
Live everyday like its your birthday
"You used to be so happy?" they say
I no longer wanna live deep in the dark
I wanna spread peace and sungaze
The outside is here to amaze
But really..

[Verse 3]
I'm a mess
I have to get this off my chest
Before I move on, embrace the smile
I have to confront what I've kept to myself for a while
Well.. Years
I been looking at the stars with some tears
But the reason you there is to learn
To conquer your fears
Gotta fight then you earn
I am in the process
Well now it is your turn
What is life?
Feeling like I'm going too deep now
Maybe I should get on my bike
To feel the light shining on me
It's glistening down
Spread your wings
Go head and touch the sky
Don't need to ask me no questions
You already know why
Because the wind will take you
Navigate until you really high
Keep it pushing
Don't do too much overlooking
Only set yourself some goals
Achieve them
Don't let nobody influence you into leaving em
Had a lotta motives since baby me
I've stuck to em, can't you see?
Grip onto what you really love
Push until it's no longer a dream, you're living it up
Lemme see you smile
The true meaning of happiness is all in your soul
Appreciating the little things
Like waking up to find the sun shining through your window
Knowing that you've lived another day
That's a reason to say "Hey.. You know what?
Let me give it a try"
I don't have all the answers
I'm learning too
This is a song about life
And the things I've been through
You're not alone, are you?
