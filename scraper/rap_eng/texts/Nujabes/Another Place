[Verse 1]
Ascending to another place in time – I place my rhymes
Up in the face of time I’m outer space tonight
I’m out of space in my notebook
Pace of my heart got me feeling like I’m caged in the dark
Yea I smoke good toke like an eighth a day I’m feeling great today
I take the pain away the paint I spray on canvas the cannabis
Got me leveled like I’m building seven
I just vanish - atlantis
The man with plan is not God so I exit out this planet
Implant my dreams what if I can’t it seems that I am damned to be
Another number in equations that equating to a fantasy
The women, cash, and beem-ers to drive in while I drive in a spaceship
And exiting out the matrix the artificial made this the population racist
To operate the maze they lost in
They tossed in they souls cause that’s what it cost them
That's what the cost is

[Verse 2]
What’s the point of life - mine’s
The pencil while I write - I’m
Feeling so enlightened when I write rhymes out of my right mind
I’m righteous but I light spliff’s with the devil – rebel angel
Changing from an angle – look at this perspective
Damn it’s really painful – this is for the nexus
This is what I’m left with death or a check for 2 mil I’m to ill
Should of picked the blue pill
Now I’m in the blues feeling to real – is it
Reality and fiction clashing together it’s causing friction
Hash on the table I’m pretty lifted
Cash on the table I’m pretty blessed yet
I stress like every single day bout the grave situations that I face
Never take a breath when I blaze dope or spray flows around the rainbow
I’m thankful for every little thing that I came for
