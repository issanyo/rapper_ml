[Intro]

[Verse 1: Gino Ba$quiat]

I find purpose in these words that I spit so its cursive
Its the resurrection of real shit in due time its coming
My nigga time is of the essence, I come with a timely presence
This gold soul nigga shining they mining for my excellence
Now you might have to rewind that shit
Over your head off the ledge probably fall off a cliff
All I want is the admiration
Ain't nothing wrong with paper chasing yall look for fame, fame coming with Satan
Hell of a package I dont need that shit
Fuck the devilish nigga eat a dick ho choke that shit
Ive been rhyming since I was nine but I ain't know that shit
Swear the irony always follows me like romance flicks
Thats some english three shit for you bitch
My rhymes come equipped with a mental high so vibe with this shit
Im with the birds in the sky im elevated off this medication
Always meditating now my body starts to feel awakened
They comatose to my lyrical word flow
I never boast but im gifted get you bitches to listen
I spit arson nigga caution you fucking with a deadly arsonist
I spit flames and these bullets take aim and hit brains
By the end of this tape, I know you gon know my name
Its Gino The Great came to conquer and take food off your plate
Look in these blood shot eyes and recognize the real times
How im the ruler of you losers you are under my demise this a battle cry
