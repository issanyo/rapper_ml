Yeah, uh, listen
One time, Claz, uh, yeah

Yo, Listen
I don't really get the people in this world
Who knew you could find a lot of evil in a girl, shit
And I really had my fair share bro
When it comes to my music it scares them hoes
All thinking each and every song is about them
Bitch you ain't the only girl that I fucked around with
Right now, I'm living in a rut
I will keep it spitting hot, til' I hit the crickets stop
And when I do, I'll go ahead and take a bow
And yes I fuck with chicks but I'm never playing fowl
A lot of haters talk me down but I love it
Cause' love is really hate you fucking clown you're just bugging
On the real, i think the smokings catching up to me
Yaking up my lungs, yelling out that it's enough for me
But shit, I can't really stop
The calm is too far and my palms is feeling hot, damn
In may i'm going off to the Philippines
Mum's sending me over to stop spliffing trees
I mean would you call it addiction
I'd call it more of an author's prescription
You got to see I'm addicted to the hate
I'm inflicted by this vision
I'm restricted to this race
The only thing that is hidden is my fate
I'm a killer with the lyrics, mix the rhythm with the pain
And in the last 18 months, I've had 2 foul relationships
I hate this stuff
My ex ex said I'd never amount to shit
Yeah, good joke, A-ha no doubt you bitch
An ounce of piff, see I'm stuck in slow pace
Smoking weed and eating fucking oats ay
My throat aches and my heart's feeling weird bro
The road's straight but I can't see that clear yo
And so it's back to the Philippines
Rap with the illest steeze
Laxed I be living free
You know it's crack when I'm spitting frees
Clap if you feeling these, wack little bitch Emcees
That's right, I thrive in the silence
Rhyme so nice, don't disguise it for kindness
High off the vibrance, my remedies floating
Hennessy toasted, got to keep my enemies closer
I ain't a pessimist, I'm a realist
And fuck the messages
And fuck the feelings
And what I plan to be is really not a fantasy
Dismantling the man in me, you feel me, this is family
My sanity will be questioned by the fair few
I'm talking truth I don't need a fucking dare to
It's fair true yo, I hadn't mean to scare you
But I'm numb now, it don't matter if you care dude
