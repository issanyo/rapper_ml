[Verse 1]
Sincerely me, vices and virtues are my varying V's
Working with karma seeking spiritual peace
A gifted artist you may hear on these beats
But no superior being
'Cause all and all its the same air when we breath
Up in yo ear fuck an heir, young Aquarius king
Flows great like the barrier reef
Leave yo barriers breached
Just thought provoking this ain't spiritual preach
Should carefully heed each lyric that you hear when I speak
Often in error you see, in this era of speed
Fast pace that could keep a brother very fatigued
Rat race always running nigga where is the cheese
American dreams are sweet until we buried in greed
Scariest scene its nightmarish indeed, it's time to wake up
People remain stuck, caught up in the matrix
Will consciousness raise up?
Time will tell, truth can free you but the lies will sell
Buy ya way to heaven but you'll find you only high as hell

[Chorus]
Let me free your mind and soul
Let me free your mind and soul, yeah x4

[Verse 2]
Imagination deficiency got a grip on me
Slipping free been subliminally limiting my ability
Pray my mind don't go back to its cell
Ask god for help expel my wish into the well
Odds of it all
Chances of the fate I'll drive my mind up a wall
Are these the fruits of my labor or just the fruits of a savior
Who knows each move that I make will
Render me wretched as demons or more a beautiful angel perspective using all angles, lets assume that I'm able
Wash the feet of my enemy set his food on the table
Hope we can move past our differences
For they pull us to anguish
Lost in a battle of righteousness
That can prove to be fatal
And I'm just trynna survive
Optimize my life
What we all would like
Problems lies when someone else's high ends up costing mine
Strung out, just some addicts of desire
Bet the wisdom that you take along your path
Gone get you higher I know it

[Chorus]
Let me free your mind and soul
Let me free your mind and soul, yeah x4

[Verse 3]
Look it's one foot in front of the other
No time for back tracking
Like my women thick with a bumper
No time for half assin'
Keeping this crack crackin'
First I spit it then zip it up and distribute it
Digitally to my rap addicts
Keeps the clientele high as hell
Figure I might as well lace this knowledge in
Be elevating they minds as well
No white collar polite dollar
We on this dirty money no time clockin'
I found out how to grind smarter
Keep yo 9-5 offer, if too afraid of imagining
Getting paid from a passion doubt is yo fatal attraction
When satisfaction was lacking chasing the average
My brain was synapsing cravings adapting
Chasing a taste of the action and now I'm bouta eat
Blessed the food found a seat, silverware is obsolete
Bon fucking appetite, enlighten me, I've
Struggled as I've tried to see
How followed dream and idiotic scheme
Get used synonymously, please

[Chorus]
Let me free your mind and soul
Let me free your mind and soul, yeah x4
