[Intro]
Yea, uh
Yea, huh
Go
Gonna flow
Spit it, Yo

[Verse 1]
I got the…
Pen in my hold fear in ya mind
Feeling alike, genuine lines causing a crime
Like felonies
Now come tally these fatalities
Tragic in my agenda to murder the same boundaries
Keeping us illiterate in radio waves
Hop on the wave, flow like water washing rappers away
For a concept of filled minds, but heart is empty and shallow
I’m never feeling the love, you claimed inside of this battle
Do I fight for
Forcin’ a portion of disproportion
Causing cases wit assumptions an so much judgement distortion
That’s why i’m so separated, rated and stated
A introversion of versions that's blatantly violated
Lately i’ve been filling wit fear
For my future so elusive, wit brothers I still revere
As I steer drive slow, cruising calmly and swiftly
In a vehicle with others i’m asking (you ride wit me?)
Wit’ jealousy always clouding a conscience
Conning cooperation between me starting some nonsense
I still got a pen an a pad, pad an i’m on
Bring it on, when I bring it are you still singing along?

[Hook]
It’s like, huh are you still singing along
Singing along, sing it on singing it wrong
Getting it on, soon as I come on the song
Singing along, sing along singing along (ugh)

[Verse 2]
Nah but we alright, we alright
Huh, but you know I gotta be right
Yea, so I write to help you en-light
Yea, but you blinded by every light
So I say it all, sayin’ it all
Cravin’ a call, call for help feelin’ the fall
Feelin’ afraid, every phrase go through a phase
Or am I wrong? Is it ignorance that you gaze
Gazing upon, probly not, i’m on the spot
An if i’m not, I was formulating a plot
That is the truth, don’t you dare call me conceited
Don’t have the proof, I just assumed you would believe it
I’ve never been caught, You ain’t catching nothing but feelin’s
You attracted to lies I don’t lie, i’m just appealin’
Like a polygraph, i’m a failure no i’m just playin’
Do I goku, ckoo or feeling super just saiyan
I’m a great man, or so I wanted to be
While morally yes, but orally tragedy
That’s no disrespect, to respect everything casually
But these lyrics is only causing a casualty

[Outro]
You still sing along, singing along
Singing it wrong
Going hard, feeling the song
Singing along, sing it wrong
Killing it all, soon as I get wit the wrong
Yea, sing along, singing along
Singing along, going hard feelin’ the song
Singing it wrong, Going hard feeling it all
Soon as I go, cynical, spitting a flow
Already know, soon as i’m going to kill
Kill for the thrill, soon as I was getting the real....
