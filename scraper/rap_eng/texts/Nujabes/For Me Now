Smile for me, please
If you could smile do it now
Break a little smile
Won't you smile for me now

Smile for me now
Break a little smile for me

Now, smile for me, please
If you could smile, show me how
Break a little smile
Won't you smile for me now

Smile for me now
Break a little smile for me

See, I was never one to preach
I was sitting by the bleachers
Looking at the stars
Trying to find my Mona Lisa
“Peace up!”
She what?
He who?
Living in a glass hut
Everything is see through
Everybody sees you
She’s a little teapot
He’s a tall order
Momma’s singing please stop
Sat across the border
She just wanted change
And he showered her quarters
Dyslexic to the fact
So she read that as “supportive”
Add a dirty little secret
He might get deported
Love is blind
But her vision was distorted
Not the whole story
Just a little half of it
The other half buried
Now fast forward to the two getting married

Smile for me, please
If you could smile do it now
Break a little smile
Won't you smile for me now

Trust
Just smile for me now
Break a little smile
Won't you smile for me now

Smile for me now
Break a little smile for me

Now, smile for me, please
If you could smile, show me how
Break a little smile
Won't you smile for me now

Smile for me now
Break a little smile for me

Out of the two he’d be the one
To always bend the truth
With his quick tongue
But there she was
Alongside without a clue to what he does
He kept his lies so white
That they would shine so bright
And it would lighten up her eyes
Then again anytime he tried
To say the words on her mind
She would melt inside
He couldn’t do it
Although he was fluent
He’d say the magic words
But couldn’t prove it
Until she finally decided to break
It was a difficult decision to make
And so they parted separate way
Both with hopes for better days
And so he flew across the ocean
Left without a word and a couple hearts broken
Coupled with a couple’s heart necklace as a token
And a head full of words unspoken

Now go ahead and smile
Go ahead and smile
Smile

Smile for me, please
If you could smile do it now
Break a little smile
Won't you smile for me now

Smile for me now
Break a little smile for me

Now, smile for me, please
If you could smile, show me how
Break a little smile
Won't you smile for me now

Smile for me now
Break a little smile for me

So she got a little taste
Now her freedom she embraces
Done with all the catching up
Through with all the chasing
Patience
Learned a lesson from a frown
Now she looks up
Never smiles at the ground
Undiscovered queen
You’re the talk of the town
Said you went missing
Now you’re back with a crown

Hey, you should smile for me now
Won’t you smile for me now

Daddy’s little girl
Now she makes her momma proud
Smile loud
You could see it through a crowd

Hey, you should Smile for me now
Won’t you smile for me now

She was living in a dream
Now she’s sitting on a cloud
High hopes
She ain’t ever looking down

Hey, you should smile for me now
Won’t you smile for me now

Then she woke up sick
Now she’s falling to the ground
Rushed to the clinic
Where she saw the ultrasound

Then she broke a little smile
Even though he ain’t around
