[Verse]

So, the sun is shinnin'
It's feelin' bright
I can't see my future
It's really bright
But um, I hope you understand my words
Cause um, I love you every time I write a verse, ya know?
I'm feelin' good
I'm feeling great
I have my fate
I think I'm settling down, ya know?
I think about you every time I see the moon
So beautiful
It's like a cartoon every time I write about you
It's funny
One thing I know is that you never wanted money
You loved my mind
You loved my soul
You loved my heart
I let you go
And I'm sorry
I'm really sorry
