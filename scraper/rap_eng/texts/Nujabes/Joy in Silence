[Verse 1: Izzeo]
Look, I’m wide awake in the midnight hour
Watching lights flicker on and off, up from the tower
Lightin’ up the incense sticks late at night
Calling up my girl in case I wanna get the feels right
Mood is high and the stress is low
I know you hearing these love songs playing on your radio
Take off your coat and unlock the door
I’m gonna take you on a journey that you never ever been before
Close your eyes and imagine you’re in space
All alone in the void, but you got your mate
It’s kinda scary being up in the dark, but when you got the one you need, love will take you far
Eyes open and you count to ten, my hand in your hand, and love like we’ve never been
It’s just you and me girl and it’s always been
Let me hold you close to feel what you’ve been missing

[Hook: Joshua]
All alone at night
Sleeping here without ya
Waiting for the moment
That I get to hold ya
I know we’ve been so distant, but this is what I promise
You and I are gonna lay together while we both enjoy the silence

[Bridge: Joshua Morata]
While we gonna enjoy the silence
Ooh, we’re gonna enjoy the silence
You and I are gonna enjoy the silence

[Verse 2: Izzeo]
Are we too young for love or is it too old for us?
Because with you I feel like anything I write is enough
They can voice all their opinions but they’re fresh outta luck
Because I could give a (fuck)
I could care less until I bit the dust
So what if it’s wrong it feels so right?
Someone that’s willing to chill with me and stay up all night
We could talk about nothing if there’s nothing to talk about
And it’s amazing how quiet time can feel so right
Can feel so great, can feel so great, this is my fate
Sparking one to educate about the weight
Of having all these heavy automotions
Master of the swill-swirl mix, love potions, ay
So what’s the judgment? What’s the commotion?
Joggin’, joggin’ through my mind, engineer of the mental locomotive
Every single feelings important to the point where we stay silent and walk through our own roads

[Verse 3: Joshua]
We can either be in love or we can be irrelevant
Just let me know, girl, and I’ll make this argument
And I know it’s rough in the late cold night
Where I’m singing on stage and you might be havin’ this fight
That I’m- I’m with another woman, she keep me off balance
Well let me just say this
I can either stay true to you or consider you unimportant
But let me tell you this girl
The moment that I get to see you again
I’m gonna be holdin’ you in my arms, so we can meet, and
We’re gonna we holdin’ each other in the darkness
Just enjoying the silence, yeah

[Outro]
JMorata, Izzeo, Nujabes, Joy in Silence
You know how it is
Oh my God, that last part was really corny
That was good
