[Verse 1]
Running out of room we got to take it to the sky
Maybe to the stars, the main question is why
How we get here? Travelling through time and space
Using up the resources, disregarding the waste
Another place might be better so deploy the crafts
Got to search a few galaxies and do the math
The sun is burning out we got no time to lose
Puzzled one that tries, it's the post world blues
Technology took over, and that was ages ago
Shut down the corporations cause they make too much dough
Attack of the clones, start, day time unknown
They thought that it was fake until it happened at homes
Take the old with the new got to maintain balance
Got to make it work if you up for the challenge
By the will of the creator anything can be
The land might wither but the spirit stays free


[Hook]
Living in a post world
Soon to be a ghost world
Maybe we could get close, girl

Living in a post world
Soon to be a ghost world
Maybe we could get close, girl

Living in a post world
Soon to be a ghost world
Maybe we could get close


[Verse 2]
Radio, satellite, computer screen, television
ID, education, surveillance, unit-ism
Rhythm, rhythm, body and soul
Got to figure out a way to maintain control
Seen a lot of folks lose it in a matter of seconds
So I find myself searching, backtracking, and checking
Got to know the difference if its lewd or its false
When it comes time to pay you know the actual cost
Don't get lost in the rhetoric, the tapes and the lies
It Gets tricky when the minions are the truth in disguise
Look in the eyes, the scan might reveal the plan
New math but a [?] aging man
When [?] hits the reader and see what you've become
The new light is God, old light is the sun
Rewind to the first line, question is why
We can only unify when planes fall out the sky?

[Hook]
Living in a post world
Soon to be a ghost world
Maybe we could get close, girl

Living in a post world
Soon to be a ghost world
Maybe we could get close, girl

Living in a post world
Soon to be a ghost world
Maybe we could get close

[Outro]
Running out of room we got to take it to the sky
Maybe to the stars, the main question is why
How we get here? Travelling through time and space
Using up the resources, disregarding the waste
Another place might be better so deploy the crafts
Got to search a few galaxies and do the math
The sun is burning out we got no time to lose
Puzzled one that tries, it's the post world blues
Technology took over, and that was ages ago
Shut down the corporations cause they make too much dough
Attack of the clones, start, day time unknown
They thought that it was fake until it happened at homes
Take the old with the new got to maintain balance
Got to make it work if you up for the challenge
By the will of the creator anything can be
The land might wither but the spirit stays free
