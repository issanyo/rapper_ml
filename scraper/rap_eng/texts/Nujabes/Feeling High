[Intro]
"i'm recording by the way
Yeah, i know...
Why?
'cause you're a dork."

[Verse 1]
Let's take it back to the first day we met
It was a moment of peace i'll never forget
You were young and innocent and so was I
It was that very moment we had each other side by side
Now fast forward, a couple years later, we were at each other's backs
The hate was getting thicker, you couldn't stand the thought of me being far away, and the issues pushed us further, but listen to what I got to say
You were always there, when I needed you, we'd be up all night talking for an hour or two
If there was a problem, i'd go straight to you. There was no one else beside me anyways, just you
Back then, I would sit alone and cry, thinking how it ended, but now I just don't know why
Now if you see me with my head up, i've moved on...and my hopes are feeling high

[Hook]
Feeling high, I know I can move on, without you by my side
One more night, before I take off, and leave you behind

[Verse 2]
Back again, the feelings keep holding on, separation makes it seem so wrong, but they say "distance makes the heart grow fonder"
If that's the case, why amd I still underwater?
In the sea of emotions, world in slow motion. Don't know where i'm swimming to but it's in rotation. The way I feel for you is in circulation
But I guess that's the way love works
As hard as it gets, I keep thinking of you
Even when i'm outta town, I keep dreaming of you
Don't know what i'm gonna do, can you give me a clue?
The feels I had for you were true, but i'm finally through
In the end, you're just another memory
Our love will live for an eternity
Even up to this day, we're doing our own thing
But just know, that what we had was everything
