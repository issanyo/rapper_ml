[Verse 1: Henry Lin]
You can't say that you've been in love before if she's never made you feel insecure
Then you never tried to change yourself and when she doesn't even notice then what's it for?
Is it worth it?
Flirted for the first time, I was nervous
Didn't prepare or complete the homework
So when she awkwardly smiled, it wasn't hard to interpret
That wasn't my best performance
Then my love worsened, I'm just not perfect -- I'm guessing that was my major problem
Love of all things really isn't the most logical, making me feel unstoppable, trying the impossible
You know that you're falling when you stare into her eyes, so mesmerised it was like space and time froze
And you're willing to try looking deep inside and show her the best of yourself that you can find
But she's blind to your dedication, to the preparation
Only see you not initiating no conversations
You want to explain that you trying to be perfected so when you approach again this time she won't be disappointed
But now, I wonder if that was a waste of time and effort
If a beautiful girl is the riskiest of all investments
The answers don't matter much, although rejections suck, it's the only proof that you have truly loved

[Hook: Henry Lin]
C'est la vie, as they say, L.O.V.E. evidently is one of the painfullest things
Definitely bittersweet, melodies offbeat
Discorded, now my music is beyond repairing
C'est l'amour, even though my emotions are torn, I haven't witnessed anything this beautiful before
As it froze in the cold and it falls with the snow then its thawed and it melts, next second it's gone

[Verse 2: Henry Lin]
You can't say that you've really been in love yet if you say that you never gotten love sick
Never fantasised cliched scenes with just you and her in your pathetic dreams
Then it shatters, you question if this is really happening
Staggering on the pieces back to reality
Universality of love and all of its problems tilting the equilibrium of the human microcosm
So I guess I made a necessary sacrifice for the greater good
Tell me if i misunderstood
After all I am naive like everybody, we only understand our purpose on our final heartbeat
Love never really made sense, don't you reckon?
She's into you, next second she's acting like nothing happened
You either misinterpreted signs or it was never there
Trying to defibrillate a dead passion with the kick and snare
The saxophone whining in pain, improvising in vain, providing the sorrowful insight you'd find inside of my brain
She was the motivation for a new beginning, your head's spinning, sub-atomic particles in collision
The thing about love sickness is you never grow immune so it's just as bad if not worse the second time going through it
Nah, don't worry, I'll probably get better knowing maybe in a parallel universe we're together
