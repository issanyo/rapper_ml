[Verse 1: RichyR.I.C.H.]

Does Love and Basketball reflect on my relationship?
Making out watching Olympics, Some odd mix
We blend lips, with my finger tips to her hips
Im-ma throw a javelin to her pretty line, my eyes on her thighs
My ears to her mind, Advert come, she sigh, I, play bump n grind
Lays back, smiles, Gives thee the sex growls
Whisper in my ear, Do me, I shout Yahtzee
Haemoglobin from the neck rushed to the PP, SWV
I am strong in the knees, It seems I'm ready
Tips steady, they glide swiftly
Hurdle to the middle, go skiddle
Shot put that paddle in her channel Watch her feet and hands skaddale
Evidently She starts to stare, Hormones in pairs
As I grab hair, We Step up like stairs
Nani read-ay, I go orangutang 
Chief Keef as we beat, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang
Like Steve Rickay,Hear my old-ay, where my gold-ay
He-he, need to find ASAP
Before lash, I gotta to draw for laytax
Work Rocky
Dribble, dribble, bed all messi
A teen roller, When alone I buss a loner
U lick my front, I like your back
And how you like it like that
Large Shakes, 2 pads, and a Dog with that
To make skeet-shoot I'll supply the meat
Ooo I'm knockin' on your boots, Its pum pum I seek
Leg spread like A, won't lick the P, that's me
Add me in that Q, the R sections
Prepare for sexing, As our waist flexing
Won't dive like Usher, you better find another
These whales don't like hymen
Overboard semen-ya niggas ain't men, Don't pretend

[Hook]

Maybe its for you
I know its true
Or maybe its within you
I think its u

[Verse 2: RichyR.I.C.H.]

Frankly speaking, In the ocean I swim good
Awake with morning wood, I can, I would and I should
Be thinking about you, Shooting in gym, just wondering
While the Nova-cane is pondering
As I'm feeling, Numb! And in rhyme, I feel dumb
Niggas run on the sound of the gun
The slow one will be the quick to catch
Fap fap, Delete your bash tab
As she adores all the jabs
Assuming from the boxers
From all the moans and hollers
Stuck to my heart due to the content of the PIN
Jumping over pipes, and trashing all the bins
To get the skins
Collect 6Pack from crunchies in a break
Lactic Acid building up how long would it take?
Take rest, breathe in, then exhale the chest
Keep body Fresh
My life's so bless
Dwell less in laziness cuz you anti active
Release a smooth block
Its hooooot....

[Hook]
