[Intro]
Life, dance, stay, free, we, live
And the beat goes
Life, dance, stay, free, we, live
And the beat goes

[Verse 1: Pase Rock]
Make noise for the loved ones
Bang on the drums
Celebrate where you come from
Wake up in the morning its a blessing
Every day is a prayer
And you feel it right there, right here
But you want a little somethin' somethin'

Carry on til the evenin' is teethin'
Reach another day another search for the reason
And then the night bites in what it is
Learn how to dream enough to learn to live
Positive, affirmative, gotta make it happen like
There's an alternative now whose turn it is
Mine and I earn and give to stay permanent

Shock shock waves didn't hold your weight
Now you wanna change the clock but then it all stops
And we forget that, we wanna get back
To where we left off, a few steps off
You wanna get on, you gotta get right
Hold on sit tight, look at the dim light
Take a breath, ask yes with some insight
Say yes from your belly through your wind pipe

And now it feels like you probably should've been right
And it feels good, feels like you never left
Lil' young cat got that shit togetherness
Feel high like mount everest, forever fresh
So good, I think we want another yes
But know the facism and classism
Up to being passed like they never had rhythm
In the first place, worst case scenario
We'll be seein' and hearin' and now we're stereo

Same shit, different assholes, splash the bowl
Capture cowboy, take away his lasso
We're goin' forth to a new day our own way
This is high time, not what they say
They're playin' foul play, I'm playin' James Brown
We're gonna find out the truth any day now
They only weigh out, lookin' for a way out
I just got here, and I'm stayin'â€¦ I'm just sayin'

[Chorus]
And the beat goes
Life, love, dance, sing, no, war, stay, free, we, can, live, yes
And the beat goes
Life, love, dance, sing, no, war, stay, free, we, can, live, yes
And the beat goes

[Verse 2: Pase Rock]
Yen, Euro, Dollar sign, wipe myself
Try to keep the money all mine
All the numbers keepin' your health
I give some thought but my feelin' is felt
I can find out when this feelin' is felt
It's like that we don't gotta deal with needle in this feelin' itself
Inside when we're screamin' for help on the outside
Shinin' for the public, the DJ's love it
We're movin' with the cruise control, groove with the soul

It's new or it's old, if it's true then it's told
The negro spiritual ah-code sexual ode
204-9 area code, if it's good then it must be sold
That's what they say, but I'm still not sold
Still loyal to the rhythm and the melody
The beat and it's tellin' me, words that weigh heavily
Open my heart readily, good days they better be soon
Because I'm almost changin' my mind
(yes)

And I'm almost changin' my blinds
Spent a lot of time seekin'to find
It's more about the truth and the treat
Not about the lyric or the beat
It's more about the lines fillin' the seats
People jump in band wagons and end up on cruises
Different ideas still might fall to confusion
I spent a lot of time losin', still in the game
Enough practice, still sharp with the aim
Teeter-totter never came to my side, still enjoyin' the ride

I put my weight down just the same
Fuck pride foes died so I can tell you my name
Just leave from my life, lil' yes not a maybe in sight
Except maybe that I may be right (yes)
But the world shakes stayin up in dangerous heights
It had to come down twenty-nine flights
And when he wasn't dead, tell me what you think he said

[Chorus]
Life, love, dance, sing, no, war, stay, free, we, can, live, yes
And the beat goes
Life, love, dance, sing, no, war, stay, free, we, can, live, yes
And the beat goes
