[Intro]
Yuh, yuh, Nujabes on the beat yo, bring it in yuh
That’s what I like to hear
Unity, yuh

[Verse 1]
People all over the world wish to hate and we’re stuck in a singular collate
Captivating, memorizing all the books we read
Simplify, multiply, all the skins we shared
It’s time to take control of the feels in line, sublime, let our souls take flight
However, there’s a secret that I must confess, it’s been a long time since I dreamt for less
Everynight, all I hear the neighbours trying to say “This kid is gonna make it in the game someday”
Sometimes I wanna do; believe it
But let’s be sure that I won’t abuse it, this music it will sink into the hearts of the people of Earth
Maybe we won’t have to waste our self worth
So let’s live our lives to the best we can, and we reach to the higher plane
We can go with the plan, we can go with the plan
Take control of the man, if we don’t have to listen to the things they say, we can do it everyday

[Hook]
Unity, unify
Everybody hold hands, we can touch the sky
Aiming up high, yeah

[Bridge]
Hawaii represent, Manila represent
Tokyo represent, wassup
Check and hide, yo

[Verse 2]
And right now, going through is just me and you
Picking choices of the memories that we just threw
If we can solidify the misunderstanding of the connection that used to be broken among us too
You and I were sticky like glue, so let’s try to make this night last
Because the dream may be over fast

[Outro]
Yeah I thought that was pretty good
Save that for take
