[Verse 1:]
Ultraviolet, attract like ultramagnet
You know the rules take two and pass it
We're going there. Great space coaster
Reclining seats and beats
Rubbing two sticks together yeah we're bringing the heat
Fire fire to the jam man get with the program
My shit is put together like two lovers that hold hands
It's not clich√© time waits for no man for real
That's why we're on hand flexing the skill
Got dough, got chicks, got rhymes, and got bills
That's why on most days I just like to write and chill
You wanna get to know me just know flavor is a synonym
I'm on my game like Mr. Whitefolks, Pimpin' Ken and them
Mr. Whitefolks, Pimpin' Ken
When it comes to women friends ladies say I'm a gentleman
I give it to you straight from the source and skip the middleman
So quit your fiddling and fumbling
You're like some little kids when they're playing
Always getting into something when their parents aren't looking
C'mon now you know better
The green is kinda nice but they say the blues are mo better
Inspires go getters to get up and go get
And it's all gravy till they're all up in your shit
Word life black and white got it all way twisted
It's not at either and it's in the middle when you mix it
Stage set for the wrecking so commence with the show
Pase Rock will make the people say ho! it's grey matter
Pase Rock

[Verse 2:]
Microphone controller who drops flows like waterfalls
For the countryside concrete jungle and all of y'all
Know who to call when you want it done bangin
Not your average ordinary style- forever changing
On the map on par rap major metropolis
Sky's the limitation but the ground is also bottomless
Some people have forgotten this and failure is monotonous
So quit while you're ahead cause life ain't making any promises
Except to be a pain in the ass, no joking
That's why people focus on making the cash
I make songs that appeal to the mass songs that last
Songs that ask questions that you can't answer too fast
Try to keep up with Pase you might get lost in the dust
I switch speeds on the reg. sometimes It's hard to adjust
I bust flows authentic while the rest are augmented
I get all in it and put my all in it
When it's all spent it's all good cause then I get it all back
And keep the flows on course never going off track
It's like that baby! never the wack
SHIT is way tight dude why should I cut you some slack?
Cause I'm filling the gap with that sound that they lack
They wanna know where I'm going with that it's grey matter
I'm filling the gap with that sound that they lack
They wanna know where I'm going with that it's grey matter
