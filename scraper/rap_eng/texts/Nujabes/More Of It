[Verse 1: Firmz La 4ormative]
Writing for the greater good you niggas best believe it
My glasses ain't fly but CJ knows the way I see it
You see that man in my dreams I'm tryna' fucking be it
If I got a chance I could never stand there and just pree it
Saw the badness inside me and behind I had to leave it
Tryna make my wisdom expand
All over all different lands
SDC we blue printing the plan
We just making the jams
Pointing out all the scams
As we inhale a high amount of grams
But now you know who we are
One day we'll all be starts
Who don't give a fuck about the riches and cars
Just don't sleep on us cos we ain't got lazy bars
On my brow is where my third eye is moulding
A greater knowledge what I'm holding
Born in the 90's the era of the golden
Keeping my faith yeah I'm hoping
Cos on this rap game I'm tryna go in
Is like the rhythm of life is what  I'm flowing
While the flower of height is what I'm smoking
Gotta take it serious no time for joking
Jamie make that chorus roll in

[Hook]
Is Firmz La Formative
He's quite lyrical for a kid
Just a bit of my flow and I got more of it
