[Verse 1]
Now's the time, last crime
Josh's got a new rhyme
New threads, more meds
Going out or stay in bed
Television, battlefield
Salesman got the nice deals
That will set this place on fire
Wait

[Verse 2]
Night fog, night call
Gotta go, so long
Noisy nights, loud fights
Josh's staying all night
Weekend, January
Praise the Lord, Hail Mary
Staying 'till a new dawn

[Hook 1]
Father would be upset
No worries, no fret
Play piano, sing a song
We'll be up all night long
Having a drink or two
With a buddy, or a few
Am I gone? Who knew
Fuck it, it's just me and you

[Verse 3]
Friday night, at the park
Our love and colors made sparks
Late in the moonlight, what an evening delight
Held your hand, kissed your lips
All the nights that I missed
I wished you stayed with me forever
So we'll enjoy this lovely weather
If you want, I'll give you my sweater
Sitting under the shade as the rain gets wetter

[Hook 2]
Lovers and friends are the best thing to own
If I ain't got neither than I got no love to show
Romance and friendship are two big things
On separate sides, I'm happy to belong to two sittings
Josh's got a new rhyme
And right now it's chill time
And right now it's chill time...
