Part 1 - Bye

[Intro]
Oh yea
Oohh yeaaa yea, yea
Ooh yea
Ooh yea
Oohh yeaaa yea, yea
Oooooohhh

[Verse 1]
I rock you flow
Staying high in your lows
I am ashamed
Baby you don’t even know
I know you glow and I only grow
I only grow when I go ayo
Maybe i’m blind but i’m on my way
I really don’t know what else to say
So I reside but I stay by you
I really don’t know what else to do (uh)

[Hook]
I still feel yoouu, oohh yea
Do you feel me tooo, oohh yea (uh)
We fall In fame and we can’t sustain
You say I changed, not like you the same
The way that we never leave mundane
Sometimes we never say bye, our way (uh)

[Verse 2]
I’m sittin’ down tryna’ dream that dream
But this is feeling like a movie scene
Too much pain spilling on that screen
I swear it’s not cause of you, I mean
I don’t know where do I go
No bread for you, but you still come through
Ohh yea
Thank you for yoouu, oohh yea (uh)
Yes you just yoouu, oohh yea
Ohh yea
You changed my life here for the time
Take that time rise me in a decline
I’m hoping that I don’t regret what I say
But I ain’t gonna just expect ok (uh)

[Hook] x2
I still feel yoouu, oohh yea
Do you feel me tooo, oohh yea (uh)
We fall In fame and we can’t sustain
You say I changed, not like you the same
The way that we never leave mundane
Sometimes we never say bye, our way (uh)

Part 2 - Frame a’ Mind

[Intro]
Huh, what?
Oh you thought I was done?
Nah
Back when I go killing the call
An everybody killing em’ all
The cell destruction was in your cranius
Going after a single victim an making it hienius
Back to when I was just an idiot
Feelin myself drillin’ it, early oral affiliate
Literal in the term that death is within’ our vindicate
So you notice we killing it, wit this lyrical syndicate

[Hook]
What’s the deal explain how you feel
Your frame of mind a pivotal picture spinnin’ the real
Livin’ on borrowed time, while you borrowing mine
No wonder I be illiterate tryna write a rhyme
So we livin within a pryme
So they say cause we really in a decline
An so I already notice they feelin it
Though they notice we killin it, wit this lyrical syndicate

[Verse 1]
An so they is always blinded
The power credited is decapitating the minded
An keeping deficit in our greens, turning to blue’s
Your downs turn to ups,  your wins start to lose
Babylon, i’m seeing a Babylon
Babylonian is every human doing it wrong
In the eyes of the higher power tryna devour
Just no that we stripping your power every hour

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What’s the deal explain how you feel
Your frame of mind a pivotal picture spinnin’ the real
Livin’ on borrowed time, while you borrowing mine
No wonder I be illiterate tryna write a rhyme
So i’m winnin’ and winnin’, winnin’ and spinnin’
In a pool no rest, i’m sinnin’ swimming in women
In a starstruck dream, i’m waking up from a fantasy
Fantasizing the size of my impact on your morality

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
What’s the deal explain how you feel
Your frame of mind a pivotal picture spinnin’ the real
Livin’ on borrowed time, while you borrowing mine
No wonder I be illiterate tryna write a rhyme
Ok we getting ready to slay
When you know we chipping brothers like frito-lay
Lay ya down and surround your love covered in lies
You suit up to pay your dues
But can’t afford your ties

[Hook]
