[Intro: Substantial]
Substantial and Nujabes
Still doing this
Yeah

Sorry love
Sorry love
Sorry love
But it seems like it isn't in the cards for us

[Verse 1: Substantial]
Me and you is a blessing see
Sorry, sweetheart we can never be
The little things you do be depressin' me
Still, baby girl, we can never be
You only want one night of ecstasy
Thanks but no thanks it can never be
Cause I got a wife at home that I'm blessed to keep
And to fool around with you would be the death of me
Can't add new ingredients of the recipe
Cause it isn't fair to you nor fair to me
And more importantly
It sure isn't fair to her
Guess we might've had a chance before I married her
Cause wifey is worth more than life to me
A soulmate
Who am I to control fate?
Cause somebody like you is much more than a cud buddy
But I can't give you all the things that you want from me
So...

[Hook: Substantial]
We can't be, we won't be
Sorry love
We can't be, we won't be
Sorry love
We can't be, we won't be
Sorry love
But it seems like it isn't in the cards for us
We can't be, we won't be
Sorry love
We can't be, we won't be
Sorry love
We can't be, we won't be
Sorry love
But it seems like it isn't in the cards for us

[Verse 2: Substantial]
I know you think I'll be the perfect man
But it seems like the Most High had other plans
Besides I'm no better than my brotha man
Can't run around like Mr. Lover Man
Tryin' to maintain
Spend the rest of my life with the same dame
That's right, uh
Found the right one
Sounds like fun
But I ain't this and that
Cause if I lose her, slim chance I'll get her back
This is real life
This ain't cinemax
Tryin' to hear my seed's
Feet go pitter-pat
On these hardwood floors
On this house we own
They get hot, we know
But it's not for show
Not that anything's the matter with you
But there's no guarantee that I'm compatible with you
And I can't make you into something you're not
Know people look around for what they already got
So...

[Verse 3: Substantial]
I ain't tryin' to
Waste your time, boo
I know you've been stepped on
And been lied to
God bless the next man who's lucky to find you
It's hard to sever ties
But, baby, I got to
Uh, that's the way it is
I know you don't know what to think of this
And I'm really sorry that it came to this
Feels like the end, let’s pray it is
Cause they say it’s easier that way
That’s passé
And it hurts like a bad date
And the pressure is enough to make a back break
But to lead you on would be mad fake
So do your thing, baby
I'll do mine
Don't worry 'bout me, girl
I'll be fine
This is all my fault
I'm too kind
And a decent human being's hard to find
