[Hook]

Sneakin' through the night, lost out in the woods
A hundred twenty minutes past the friendliest neighborhoods
Just me by my lonely and a box of canned goods
Can't forget about the crickets, begun to chill
Kick it till the sun shows face
But right now the moon is vicious
The wind's poking at me, I'm starting to get suspicious
Of the tall tress and leaves who's hiding the blair witches
They're calling me names
And something wet is crawling on me
It started to dawn on me
When the water started falling on me
I'm laying in this mud for a purpose
Began to feel nervous in this jet black circus
Flashlight starts to short circuit
No matter how hard I punch the cold I can't hurt it
Best believe it smacks back something mean
I bet during the day here
Everything looks green that may be brown
Judging from how it sounds when my feet hit the ground
Somebody's name rustles and the leaves need to shut up

[Interlude]x4

It's getting hectic
Yo, It's getting hectic
It's getting hectic
It's getting mad hectic

[Verse]

Yo I don't know what happened
Is your name blue?
Think the sky's red
Yeah that must be you
But it's night time, give me a hand now
It's just a finger man I don't understand how
I got in this cardboard box, the walls are like pillows
These curtains (Yeah), I kinda like it though
What I really wanna say is
(AHHHHHHHH)
Draw blanks or (?) seeing stars
It's the only thing between me and mars
We can get there but we gotta drive cars
Friends don't let friends go to other planets
Is your brain on crack rock and hard granite?
And as I pick it up, I can see your thoughts
I see the spaceships
I see the astronauts
But where they going?
Where they expected?
From the smell of it, things are getting hectic

[Interlude]x4
It's getting hectic
Yo, It's getting hectic
It's getting hectic
It's getting mad hectic

Wake up!
Yo man wake up!
Yo dude wake up!
