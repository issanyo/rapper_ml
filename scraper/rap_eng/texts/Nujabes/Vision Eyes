[Intro: Golden Boy]
Vision eyes.  Realize.  Check it out, yo

[Verse 1: Golden Boy]
Everything goes exactly as I predicted it
Though minutiae is different, I nailed the gist of it
Just failed to adjust.  Baby, it was a bust
As I was saying, craving blunts, then bubba started playing
Somebody save us.  I'm seeing futures
So what's the use of knowing the truth if no one's going to believe you?
The Curse of Cassandra.  My vision eyes
Reveal all the answers and seem to leave no surprises
To live and die and circumscribe circumstances
A paralyzing affair, trying's a fool's errand
You see what I'm saying?  I'm sorry if it's scary or obtuse when
You feel you're cruising in Doc's Delorean
Popping vodka, pouring juice in, demeanor sober
Tomorrow morning, I'm seeing a hangover
My gang's growing older.  They know I'm clairvoyant
I get harangued like gold.  Just try to enjoy shit a little

[Hook: Golden Boy]
And it annoys me a little
Sans joy, see through time
And skip stones on the River Styx
And be the first to abandon ship

[Verse 2: Golden Boy]
Déjà vu, mayhap—have you been here as well?
It feels super familiar, pray tell
Ever get the urge to take a draft of Mimir's well?
Trip on what's knitted within cashmere veil?
Egyptian glyph, cavern sequence.  In sleep, magic dreams reveal hidden patterns
Between what is real and imagined
Money, I have a secret
Spoil the ending, I wish I couldn't see it
To me, it's no more profounder than mere logic
A downer beyond years as we flounder
And fought what I thought would be inescapable
Like love lost, long-term users incapable
Of forming any action spontaneous
Lay it on the line and our mind got the rude and the brainiest
Alongside by those who know not what it's like
Under looming night, more ice, doomed by the foresight a little

[Hook: Golden Boy]
And it annoys me a little
Sans joy, see through time
And skip stones on the River Styx
And flip a rhyme with my boy Chris
