[Verse]
I'm wide awake in the midnight
I've been watching lights flicker on and off
Up from the tower lightin' up the incense
It's late at night
Calling up my girl in case I wanna get the feels right
The mood is hot, and this dress is low
I know you're hearing these love songs, playing on the radio
Take off your coat, and lock the door
I'm gonna take you on a journey that you've never been before
Close your eyes and imagine you're in space
You're all alone in the void
But you got your mate
It's kinda scary being up in the dark
But when you got the one you need, the love will take you far
Your eyes openin', count to ten
My hands in your hands in love like we've never been
It's just you and me girl
And it's always been
Lemme hold you close to feel what you've been missing

[Hook]
All alone at night
Sleeping here without ya
Waiting for the moment
That I get to hold ya
I know we've been so far away
But this is what I'll promise
You and I are gonna lay together, while we both enjoy the silence

[Outro]
Gonna enjoy the science
Oh girl you're gonna 'joy it
You and I gonna
You and I are gonna
Yeah
Enjoy the silence
