Nasty, flavor major pase banger
Rolling like super large heavyweight, danger
Fly for the loveliest sky
Don't ask why
Crosstown told me lies getting stuck by gypsies
Pack words of substance and five coming with me
Hellified bonafide
Middle finger emcee
What they've got against me?
My shade tank is empty
Talk all you want I see your eyes get shifty
Bullshit as usual
Bless the beats beautiful
Lee Quinones, whole car, eighty
Three years old and it still sounds cold
Got a decent hand, put my cards down never fold
Paper stays dirty lines measured in gold
But ain't worthy
Hmmmm
Think like thoughts make life
Then look around feeling like that ain't right
I see you showing your stuff dude that shit ain't tight
Force fed fast food always in a bad mood
Rolling with bad chicks and bad dudes
Acting mad rude
Put a sock in it
Cultivated and developed the sound and put stock in it
(High)
Sick of sitting around watching time go by
Now you're sitting back like how does this cat
Rhyme so fly
I'm the type of guy that hopes your feelings get hurt
Bad, worse and put the fam first
But not the type of guy to rub your face in the dirt
I draw the line, fresh like all the time
Push pens 'til the program ends
Forever going all ways
North south west east for days
Hey yo, y'all don't know me
Don't act like it homie
And when it comes down to the money you
Need to show me
Because in that bullshit I don't deal
Straight down and straight up for real

[Hook x2]
I got no time for your bullshit c'mon
People if you feel me let me hear you say c'mon
In that bullshit I don't deal, straight down and straight up for real

Hardcore, softshell
Name Pase La Rockwell
What happened to these emcees man
They all fell
Off the map I'm onstage off the hook
Rocking it
Getting money of the books
Off rip, off the chain
On the real, make you feel like you're caught
Outside in the rain
Because it's coming down just the same
You know the name, say it, five denzels
We got game
Fantastic, live on steel wheels and black plastic
I'm on the level, you wanna play but can't match it
It's like magic word to Ed I gotta have it
Who's next it's automatic (baby)
Smooth, chili sauce, chicken grease and gravy
Catch me on the floor lovers rocking with your lady
Damn, you're still trying to figure out who I am
Patrick that's it go ahead with that shit man

[Hook x2]
I got no time for your bullshit c'mon
People if you feel me let me hear you say c'mon
In that bullshit I don't deal, straight down and straight up for real

Back to basics, all over the track like Asics
Sending emcees off and through many stages
Got books and pages rhymes I do away with
If you don't have shit to say then don't say shit
Pase, words and guns things you don't play with
Dangerous, fade you with heat like Al Green and grits
Over beats that bang just like this
Damage, vandalize the skies with my language
The strangest palms are pushing pause on the playlist
Esoteric like my man Seamus
That's why I stay faceless
Strange days, people can't manage
Feeling the shockwaves all across the planet
They wanna know who planned it
Lock it down and ban it
You, me nobody can understand it
Chaos, rage headlines front page
Break out the spotlight bullshit centerstage
