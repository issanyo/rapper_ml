[Verse 1 : Pase Rock]
What do you want from me
I can only give so much
So reach out if you want a cold touch
I want that warm good love
I thought you might be someone that i could love
Had to take a step back though
Get in react mode
All that speaking in code
About the end of the road
Got my mind on overload
And now i don't know
All that second guessing and confessing
Asking me questions you already know the answer to
Makes me wanna cancel you
But you light up my life night after night
The second thing after my mic
And you don't like that
The emperess strikers back
Now we're right back where we started
Another sad love song for the broken hearted
That's way played out
Like right before my feelings came out
Always thought that we could go the same route
You gave doubt to that sentiment
I thought i could get rid of it
I thought it was a teency weency little bit
Now it's on some big shit
Taking over
So it might be over
But i'll still be waiting for you early october
What do you want from me ?
What do you want from me

[Verse 2 : L Universe]
I be watching you but you don't see me
You the independant type that keeps yourself busy
Waiting around for you to correspond is risky
I guess more than just friends ain't all it seems to be
You and I, we definitely not on the same page
Or even similar frequencies and lately
Your mind's traveling, elsewhere
That's why the conversations feelin' empty
How can i be down ? What can i do to make an entry
Into your world, squeeze me into your tight itinerary
Then we, could let the chemistry flow
One topic causin' chain reaction, most inner-secrets be told
Takin' till the wee hours til we both feelin feeble
Whisper someting sweet around your cheek bones
Yo that's the sequel, the odyssey of love expressed
Audibly above the rest, probably the least complex
Yes, crazy she drives me, and yo the way she moves me, is seismic
But yo i'm back to analyzing
It's that butterfly in your stomach sensation
That test my patience

[Verse 3 : Pase Rock]
In case you don't understand
I used to just wanna hold your hand
Now i'm trying to figure out your plan
And angle
What you're thinking about
Where you're coming from
In case you don't understand ...

[Verse 4 : L Universe]
The way you feel
Me calling you on the phone is ten to one ratio
These days, with all the space you create between us
It's gettin hard to to relate, i need a leeway to think
So I can understand

[Verse 5 : Pase Rock]
I just wanna understand
If i am to be your man
If i am to be your boy
If i am to be your friend
Is ti all supposed to end
Or is it just about to begin
If i am to win or if i am to lose
I just wanna understand

[Verse 6 : L Universe]
... but sometimes i don't
Get you mindstate you whole flow, you tend to throw
Words that confuse me, so i splurge on the looseleaf
Pen hits to take my feelings ou profusely, so I hope you start to understand

[Verse 7 : L Universe]
... understand, set apart, unique
Original brand with things to do, it's time to move on
Music's my prophylactics, ever increase my tracklist
Never Stagnant, visions to flip to new chapters

[Verse 8 : Pase Rock]
In case you don't understand
When the words leave my hand
It's an extension of who i am
How i feel at the time
Inspiration for jams
And i thank you for that
But next time i call you
You better call back
