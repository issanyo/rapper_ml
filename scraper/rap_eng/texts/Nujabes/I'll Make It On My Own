[Verse 1: Bigg Mark]
I’ll make it on my own!
I’m the only one following this road
This is the life I choose
I gotta stay up; I can no longer can snooze
Cause If I do, then I might be the one to lose
I gotta…keep on going; make sure I make the top
Make sure every song that I make drops
I gotta make sure my music blows
So I spend endless nights trying to compose
It’ll take some time from my mind
But I want my career to take flight
High as a kite, riding in the sky
And not dropping like a kid hearing a lullaby
Damn, I just got to keep on going, I ain’t stopping for no one
I’m getting excited like a Dog with his bone
Yo, I’ll make it on my own (X2)
