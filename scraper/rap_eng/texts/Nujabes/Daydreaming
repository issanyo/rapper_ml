[Verse 1]
I wanna spend the rest of my life sittin' in the clouds
Daydreaming of a future, everything is safe and sound
You had to leave the dream alive for me to keep going, so I thank you for the fun and it's nice knowing
My mind is spiritual, I'm an individual, the vision that I process is apsirational
Breathing new life as the wheels turn each day, so I plan to be somewhere inspirational
As the sun goes dry, and the sun stops by
I'll be dreaming in the clouds when my thoughts start to fly
Imagination is boundless, found this artifact of love from a girl once forgotten
The dreams from my head so sudden, and right now my ideas are writing
The spirits in June disappear in the noon, I could have said goodbye, but you chose to go too soon
I wanna make the soul bounce to the beat of my steps when I walk on the ground in the 808 heat
As much as I want, see the beautiful view, my head keeps telling me to live life and forget you
I wouldn't trade my love for the world if I had to. I would be telling a lie if I was forced to, and oh yeah, i'd be singing a song if I chose to
There's a million reasons to love yourself, it's be amazing how we can see ourselves
If we all stopped dreaming, we'd all lose meaning of the face that makes us smile. Such divine grace
The way that I think of love keeps me whole at night
From the heavens to the skies, to the birds flying high. From the highs to your lows, let the music flow

[Verse 2]
Once again, back to the start, where we left off
Soaring high up above the mountains, see you laughing
All the freedom, that we possess opens up our euphoria, exploring our hearts 'till we find our eutopia
All of the children looking up and watching, all of the magic put into the hate and stress
There's a point in our lives to at least express...Our respect for the future, love for nature, have some hope for the mothers that nurture
They gave us love and respect so it's our time, to move the love even further
Let us pray for the ones that are put to rest, hoping that the generations dream the best
Would you be my guest? If you sign here, maybe you could be the next

[Verse 3]
Starting off from the very end, all things reconsidered
As the elderly descend, newborns are delivered
There's a future that awaits us all, maybe now, maybe never, but we gotta clear away this weather
As intense as the heat goes, dreaming for the ocean to overflow
All the negative matter disposed in the minds of the people, pray on top of the church steeple
Waiting for the clouds ain't enough for the evil to clear away
But, i'm sitting on top of the clouds tonight, dreaming for a better vision to soar as I take flight
I know i'm gonna be alright. Ayo Jun, play this tune one last time...
