(Flowers). Yes that’s what she smells like
Beautiful, swell & ripe & smoother than melted ice
You could just tell she’s nice. I viewed her & felt her type
Heavenly she fell from heights. I need her ’cause she smells like (Flowers)

Something ’bout her I know just know it’s right
Maybe it’s how she gives me warmth on those colder nights
Or company on lonely hikes. Comfortably she floats so light
My only sight but I want her ’cause her aroma’s like (Flowers)

With her I want to spend my life
That minor frugal sacrifice is such a tempting price
The least expensive flight. Good with women & men alike
I’m strongly infatuated with her because her scent is like (Flowers)

Extraordinary glorious my baby is quite
When blatantly strifed she’s my aid for the greatest of plights.
I’m by her on those lazy days with the blazingest light
Her flavor slight but I crave her ’cause her fragrance is like (Flowers)

A gift from mother earth, too often told of what’s her worth
Exchanging what becomes of trees for what’s from under dirt
A sprout that clouds the mind as love from such an ugly hurt
Her soul’s divine behold my eyes are glazed from loving her
I cover her in a blanket & get a fire going
To keep her warm. We laugh & play through entire mornings
Waking & baking cookies up’s how we retire rumblings
Silent mumblings while we lie circumferenced by our comforts

(Flowers). Mm, my oldest love
She soars above & reaches like an opened bud
Then she brings me crashing back to grounds like a sloping flood
She got a gorgeous fluff but I dig her ’cause her odor’s of (Flowers)

Peacefully higher than the whitest dove
Born from the dryer mud. To warn before you try your luck
& pry her up be sure she’s ready for you or you might get stuck
If not that sniff is probably gonna remind you of (Flowers)

Baby listen, you the only one that do
When I’m lonely & I’m blue or with the phoniest of dudes
Or when I throw some jazz on in the tholoniest of moods
I tell ya, I want to bury my face in ya just so I could smell your (Flowers)

Intoxicated by your rosiness
I hold your kiss, long & thick, for the full effect
Toasty we sit, real cozy when daylight is done
The brightest one, she lights up the room like some giant sun (Flowers)

My night & day life display
When stifling pains come they fly away. They sigh & say
That my wife’s a phase like unapproving parents & I disagree
I tell them people please come & get a whiff of these (Flowers)

So exquisite in your intricacies
‘specially when you feel low I deliver extra kisses
My blessed mrs. so I’d never think of kidding ’bout you
The fact of the matter is that I can’t live without your (Flowers)

Who else could be my best indulgence
I inhale your essence deeply ’til my chest is bulging
Your flesh is gorgeous & exceptionally bulbous
In all the right places so of course I like tastin’ your (Flowers)

My life’s crucial benefactor
I experience with teariness & do again thereafter
My goodest friend is rather loyaler than usually duller types
I wanna fly with her like soaring bouquets full of nice (Flowers)

I’m just the dirt in her garden, she’ll always fill my holes
Sprinkling seeds of love like flower petals in a trail at home
Leading to her there alone releasing her pherimones
In the sheets barely clothed, beauty in it’s rarest form
The purest woman her natural afrodisiac
Secretes a magic signal when we’re in the bath leaning back
& I believe in that. A gift for eyes her perfection is
Perplexed by this while hypnotized by her estrogen
Chemically connected in that etchings in our tree of life
Exhibit our foreverness together on this freedom flight
A universe is born, produced by such romantic energy
This handsome entity’s immensely stenciled by our mental chi
The birth of blissful feelings, high’s the limit, nonimprisoned
Sky blue prisms fly through vision idly drifting might go distant
I kiss her then lift her & we lightly breach the atmosphere
Without a shred of fear, I shed a tear, I’m glad she’s here
She smells like flowers
