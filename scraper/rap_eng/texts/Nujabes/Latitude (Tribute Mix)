Too many questions and unset suggestions
A road chosen carefully, a thing i’m not prepared to see
I heard a violin but couldn’t hear the symphony
Tucked away my prayers, a reason, a legacy
Tomorrow’s the new today
Yesterday was meant to be, so much to say
I let the music play repeatedly
Something profound, a few moments in time
Conflicted, i get it
It wasn’t you or is it me i still rememeber the day
Still smell the ocean
Early in the morning, a horizon is broken
A chapter as it closes unwritten and open
Tended to the field of dreams and keep hoping
We do the best we can and everything that’s right
But part of me is a cynic and it’s putting up a fight
Conflicted, i get it
The story of our life
We live another another day and good night, thank you

So when we miss get to ground i can hear it in your sound
Yo with aerial movement, free to just be to see the five deez with ease
You must mean, the coolest of the cool
We shine but without the jewelry
Fine but without the fuel that’s gassed up
Frontin with the ass stuck some dudes are legends in their own mind
Ego, reppin to their own rhyme
Hold up, despise out we holed up at hyde out
Flying by the night soul records so should question in Shibuya
Praise john doing cal David on the moon
Transmission technicians make the show to fans listen
Keep it steady accounts unequal amounts of love without a doubt
And love is all that counts
My man Nujabes get honored like holidays
A giant they’ll all say
The timeline’s proof rest in peace Seba Jun knew the truth

(I'm gonna flip it for you Jun)
I used to call you in your mobile phone
I made a whole record one floor down from your home
Kids are putting up your samples on the internet sites
Instead of staking the crates with it
They’re not even debating it
We used to have dinner and spots with a nice place to sit
Inside waiting, for us to sip the libation
A rocker, a pleaser, from chiba to ibiza
Created heat inside this planet that could never freeze up
It will never ease up, your sound was like a potion
The antitode, though our goodbye was unspoken
I needed time to react, and i still do in fact
It’s because the effects, my attentions reflect
I keep the bond that we set, from the day that we met
Combined the vocals with emotional technological depth
We can’t fall from the pressure, a new life awaits (and rhythmic breaks)
