[Verse 1: Substantial]
Take that slap to your grill cause you're fake black
Your shit's 8-track
My rhymes rank next to A'That
24 tracks with 32 to murder you
Lyrically it's spiritually with some superb rhyme-ability
Make you hot enough to melt thermometers
My name is known for kilometers
For bombing you
Let me tell you
I'm doper than drug paraphernalia
Down for whatever I represent for good to bad weather

[Verse 2: L-Universe]
I infiltrate your aura expand your mental spare
With this rhyme scheme the vigilante with the chat
Never the first or the last like American presidents having inter-marital affairs
The aftermath of a first landing or leave your house before the party gets abandoned
Make you stiff-necked, kids start dancing my syllabus
And make rhymes like Philebus when I be laughing

[Hook]
Substantial's the name, my man don't forget it
(The ruggedness, lyrical terrorists)
Hydeout Pro. it's only the beginning
(The ruggedness, lyrical terrorists)
UV's my crew, my man we coming with it
(The ruggedness, lyrical terrorists)
Minds consecrated, prob-rob logistics
(The ruggedness, lyrical terrorists)

[Verse 3: Substantial]
My man you can't withstand the eviction of ill diction
Smack your ass into a world parallel to this one
Sober emcee iller than most cats older than me
Won't stop till every household contains a poster of me
So who want it? No response, I guess most of them flee
Think you're doper than me? Don't make me choke an emcee
Those rhymes you kicked were garbage son, you're hardly a contender
Your delivery is wack so I gotta return to sender

[verse 4: L-Universe]
Forget the grapevines, I tell you how it is
Perogative emcee double cash we slip it off like a moccasin
Maintain surveillance like inner-city delis
Remaining down low cause I go store for many
Huh? What is the prob, yo? Your face lead red like Moscow flag
My rhymes gitty back through your city like Countach Diablo
Kids think they saw me locked room not the devil the tapes that I give a demo
Dishing my similes through deep incisions
Concave desperates are for broken hearts
Too many rappers be wishing, but don't get the formula
Accrue the troops of  antics and open up
First, second, third visuals see the rituals
The sacrificing of two emcees to photogenic put in idols
Oh what a shame this industry
Maybe its time to get going my clothes dusty

[Hook]
Substantial's the name, my man don't forget it
(The ruggedness, lyrical terrorists)
Hydeout Pro. it's only the beginning
(The ruggedness, lyrical terrorists)
Dominion crew the high shit we spit it
(The ruggedness, lyrical terrorists)
Minds consecrated prob-rob logistics
(The ruggedness, lyrical terrorists)

[Verse 5: Substantial]
Emcees get dismembered January through December
Spits raps until you see a black Klan member
Test not my chest shot damage your arteries
Let my foot in your ass and you look like you're part of me
Now follow me I roll motherfuckers like pottery
Smash it into your plasma and staining the carpetry
Cause stopping me is easier winning the lottery
By now I hope you've gotten a point like archery
And before we blow it we remain on the low like middle names
I had to press for set I was bored with your little games
Cause I got something that is foreign to you, it's called skill
In fact I'm ill enough to smack the black off of Seal
And as if a holy war, your getting punished for your sins
You ride my dick so much I look like Siamese twins
You've been declared wack by unanimous decision
Refrain from kicking raps till you're out of your division

[verse 6: L-Universe]
L-Universe hungry like thousand pariahs, far from enough
With Nujabes as my accomplice
I inhale and exhale verbs, nouns, and adjectives
Rhymes schemes and structures fill my chest cavity
Mishia Pa pedigree lyrically I'm inspired
Spit fire verses my service is entire
I mark more pads than ladies who use Maxis
This international connection bridges and gapsies

[Hook]
Substantial's the name, my man don't forget it
(The ruggedness, lyrical terrorists)
Hydeout Pro. it's only the beginning
(The ruggedness, lyrical terrorists)
I run with the plague your wack crew's restricted
(The ruggedness, lyrical terrorists)
Minds consecrated prob-rob logistics
(The ruggedness, lyrical terrorists)
