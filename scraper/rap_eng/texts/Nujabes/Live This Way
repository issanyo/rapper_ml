[Verse 1]
I've been thinking
I've been thinking about

I've been thinking
About drinking
Thinking about smoking

Not weed
I need something a little more
Potent

Because recently I haven't been feeling too
Important

Like would it have really mattered
If my life had been aborted

Or if I suffered side effects
From cocaine that I snorted

I'm heroin to my own life
There's not a better way to word it

I feel like if I committed suicide
It wouldn't be recorded

That's why this eagle lays in my lap
Locked and loaded

Waiting for the moment
That perfect moment

To make everyone miss me
I just wish I could see the moment

Find out who was my real homies
And see who's souls get haunted

Who feels bad for my mistreatment
After I can't treated

The hallways you say you can't walk
Are the same halls you bullied me in

You used to hate when you seen me
Now you hate that you can't see me again

Because it's your fault
And you know it's your fault

You were jealous of me
Because I was free
From your faults

When really I hated
That you were free from my flaws

You were popular
And had tons of
Sexual intercourse

But of course
You hated that my life
Did not compare to yours

I was a nerd
I was a virgin
With dreams
To do things

But you destroyed them
Then turned me to the same thing

Now I'm just another dream



[Refrain]
And I just don't understand
Why I gotta live this way?
Why I gotta live this way?



[Verse 2]
I just don't understand
Why we gotta live this way
Tell me why we gotta live this way

All lives ain't great
We all
Don't live the same damn way

But why do we depreciate
The existence of other people

After people were battered to be sure that we were equals

Do we deprive other people of their lives
When it's their is right to live em

Is it just malism
A product of satanism

We hate so much
That we drive each other to
Self antagonism

It makes my eyes water so much
I'm starting to loose vision

Every time I see one of my siblings take their life
Because their life wasn't going right
They weren't living right

They weren't being treated right
Everybody did them wrong

After they deal with school
They have to deal with home

In a neighborhood
Where the wild things roam

Aggravated with adolescence
Tormented by temptation

No wonder you suffer
That's a deadly combination


Your being dealt blows
Like martial arts combinations

Between all your ducking weaving
You have no room patience

You've been too stressed out
And you don't feel like waiting

For you move
Your afraid of the moves
Your opponents making

But in this duel
It's not about the hits that you have taken

It's about how you get back up and keep playing

This game of life
And

Know
That you will always be able
To beat the cards dealt on the table

Put your heart in your hand
And play until you win

Cause life is like Yugioh
Don't give in to torment



[Refrain]
But I don't know why we gotta live this way
I don't know why we gotta live this way
I dont't know why we gotta live this way


[Outro]
I'm just another skinny nigga
Out here trying to make it
And it's getting so hard
That I don't know if I can take it
And everyone says
That's its make it or break it
There ain't no getting in between it
So I guess that I can't shake it
