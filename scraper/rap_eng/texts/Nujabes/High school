[Intro: Ionika]
Yeah, this is a story
About my four years in high school
An important chapter of my life
Let’s take it back!

[Verse 1]
It all started in the year of 2014
When I was just getting started as a youngster teen
I didn’t have many friends always hiding behind the fence
In my defense, I was just tryna do my best
Kids made fun of my swag cap on Yik Yak
Man, those were days that shit was just straight facts
Taking useless classes, just so I could pass this
Year without having bad grades or a bad test

[Hook]
This is my life (life) this my fight (fight)
Gotta stay strong live long no strife (strife)
This year bites but it teaches me well
To reach new heights and to chase that light

This is my life (life) this my fight (fight)
Gotta stay strong live long no strife (strife)
This year bites but it teaches me well
To reach new heights and to chase that light


[Verse 2]
I finally made some friends, I finally felt content
Joined the Hills swim team so I could play and stay lean
Went to my first party, had some Bacardi
Got drunk and wasted, those shots had me faded
Was in my friend's quincé, had fun and danced crazy
Those were the good days, just followed my own ways
As June finals came, I started to feel a little shame
Might not see my friends next year, shit they might not be the same

[Hook]
This is my life (life) this my fight (fight)
Gotta stay strong live long no strife (strife)
This year bites but it teaches me well
To reach new heights and to chase that light

This is my life (life) this my fight (fight)
Gotta stay strong live long no strife (strife)
This year bites but it teaches me well
To reach new heights and to chase that light

[Verse 3]
Went back to the same halls, felt a little appalled
To see a couple old friends come up to me and talk
Class a little awkward, stare at the SmartBoard
Had to go and make new friends or I’ll be bored
Met my tight homie called David Kim
We loved making music, me and him
He was like a brother to me, even helped him make beats
He started a band: Drums, bass, guitar, and keys

Performed our first show, it was kind of an assblow
But, we got ourselves up there and gave our best go
Shoutout to my band: Owen D, Nat, and David
Became my closest homies, it must’ve been fate see
To meet such wholesome, dope, and cool people
“Yo true!”, “So ghetto!”, good laughs and fun jokes, yo
Smoked bud my first time, had a really good high
No Fugazi band trippin', always good vibes

[Hook]
This is my life (life) this my fight (fight)
Gotta stay strong live long no strife (strife)
This year bites but it teaches me well
To reach new heights and to chase that light

This is my life (life) this my fight (fight)
Gotta stay strong live long no strife (strife)
This year bites but it teaches me well
To reach new heights and to chase that light

[Verse 4]
Junior year came around, was a big black cloud
Dark days, dark ways, no one asked if I was okay
Contemplated death cause the school system’s wrecked
Stacked my APs just so colleges could see
How hardworking I was, except there was no cause
Family issues took over, lots of fighting over
Stupid shit like dishes, trash, dirty clothes, and closure
Ran away from home, left my parents all alone
Shouldn’t have done that, so I finally ran back
Get yourself a best friend like turtle Tori Sen
Helped get junior year done with her super silly puns
Always there to talk to, always made my days fun

[Hook]
This is my life (life) this my fight (fight)
Gotta stay strong live long no strife (strife)
This year bites but it teaches me well
To reach new heights and to chase that light

This is my life (life) this my fight (fight)
Gotta stay strong live long no strife (strife)
This year bites but it teaches me well
To reach new heights and to chase that light

[Verse 5]
The final chapter of my high school book, the Common Apps had me so damn Mobb Deep shook
Applied six colleges only three replied, the essay that I wrote was strong and fortified
Senioritis kicked in, I tried to go and kick it
Went to a party got crossed and faded
Then the cops pulled up, had to jump off the deck
Ran like hell I thought the end was in full effect
As the months went by, I started to say goodbye
To all the friends I love, I was too shocked to cry
My boys James Bai, and Mike Raginsky
Through the last 4 years they were brothers to me
It’s hard to forget happy moments like these
Like my last time playing piano at Carnegie
Two concerts, one month, Lauv and 88rising
A talented artist and Asian rap rising

[Verse 6]
May comes around, I’m no longer a teen
Decided on Drexel, I’m in the Philly music scene
High school prom night, had my girl by my side
Only lasted 4 months though, I had to let her go
The end is getting closer, it’s time to get sober
Went down to the beach and got hella sunburnt
But now I gotta graduate, despite how much I really hate
Losing my friends, my family, my story- wait!
My story doesn’t end, it’s only a quarter covered
Met a cool roommate, yeah he’s Mario’s brother
Last family vacation then school is in session
Cruise ship, islands, road trips, photo sessions
At least now, I’ll be sharing my brother’s legacy
Two Drexel Dragons man, isn’t that a lil' crazy
Life is unpredictable, I gotta be adaptable
Mom, dad, 我会想你, I love you so much, this is me
