Uh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes wonder
How I keep from going under
(x4)

Ayo
Protect the village
Under the role they place me in
Bury MCs from opposite villages
Under an alias
Yellow flash the icon
Dont get caught
Under the flying Raijian
Especially when the mic's on
Ayo
Under rated, under appreciated
(?) take a tomb
Stoning these rhymes during a grave shift
Prolly in my underwear
Under where?
Probably under there
The people under the stairs
Yo
Don't be scared the lyricals under shared
I'm residing under these layers
A notebook paper to chase
Just livin under a prayer
Underacheiver but a
Legend under believers
Studied under wolverines
(???)
The country got back to it's roots
Under the president, one nation
Undivisible under the prejudice
The skin under my battles scars from
Being the avatar saving the world one verse
At a time under the elements
Ya
Under pressure
They're killing us all reckless
Under circumstances understanded
By those under the melody
Sworn under bushido
Let the sword tell it then
Keep a page under the blade
That's what I revel in
If you check
Under the robe
You will see I put shinobi
6 feet under
Whenever my art explodes
Watch me
Uh
Word to (?)
(???)
Don't be comfortable under this false
Monotony

Ayo

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes wonder
How I keep from going under
(uh, uh, uh, under)
(x4)

Uh, uh, uh, under
Under, uh, uh, uh, under
Under, uh, uh, uh, under
Under, uh, uh, uh, under
Under, uh, uh, uh, under
