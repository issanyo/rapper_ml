Light as a feather when I’m floating through
Feel like the attention I been gettin has definitely been overdue
In vocal booths I’m level-headed like a photoshoot portrait
Informed I’ve been selected from a chosen few
So don’t assume you’re competing with my militia
Defeating the competition, Rasheed when he’s on the pistons
Ideas approximately are deeper than quantum physics
And long-division, that ignorant thinking is non-existent
There’s chaos from these tedious blog submissions
But I know it pays off cause my pineal saw the vision, eh-aye
My thoughts ascensions to the heavens keep me elevated
Many hungry artists had the recipe but never made it
But dedication takes the place of degradation
Ain’t no way I let it phase me any way, I’m set to educate and
Rap, sing, producing all my beats I do whatever
And anything that you can do well I can do it better
What happened to developing skills before fortune
Rappers just investing in grills like George Foreman
Looked at the game, the scoreboard was morbid and bore
More mourning than being tormented in war by the four horsemen
I’m torn on my course but born to be great
Recording til four in the morning, my priorities straight
And horrors await, it’s important my core’s reinforced
In order not to forfeit or conform to subordinate ways
I see the government thriving off of foreign exchange
And then they wanna make ties just to shorten the lengths
I guess it’s sort of a game because they’re puppets inside
We see the one percent lie for extortion and gain
I’m constantly overwhelmed by democracy and hypocrisy
Prolly control ourselves by the policies of autonomy
Just wanna take a stand and make my grandmother proud
They chanting all my stanzas aloud, I’m rambling now
I’m the blessed maestro, and I never bite flows
So my leverage is evident wherever I go
There’s no better I know, from my head to my toes
I’m the best, you contest, a beretta might blow
