Just to get into it

When I go
I will stay long gone
When I go
I will stay long gone
When I go
When I go
When I go
I will stay long gone
When I go
I will stay long gone
Away
When I go
I will stay long gone
When I go
I will stay long gone
Away
When I go
When I go
When I go
I will stay long gone
Away
Falling
Falling
Falling
Oh he drove all his days just to hold one against her

Away
When I go
When I go
When I go
I will stay long gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

And then he rode to her house in the dead of the winter
Say
Why Not?
Why Not?
Why not?
Why not me?
Oh he drove all his days just to hold one against her
And then he rode to her house in the dead of the winter
Say
Why Not?
Why Not?
Why not?
Why not me?
"You are nourishing
That's what he said"
