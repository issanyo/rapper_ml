[Intro]
Bring it on home baby dot it for me
Bring it on home baby dot it for me, come on
Bring it on home baby dot it for me
Yeah I like that

[Verse 1]
I'm just chillin you know
Not really trippin, not really taking thangs too too serious
But you realize at the same time that none of this is a game
That's right see
I'm trying to get my components organized
I'm installing satellites and watching market growth
Keeping my eyes open lids focused barely blinking
Yeah
I keep my concepts well trained
I was trying to fuck with them other niggers
But they be getting to cinematic all the time
So I had to go on about my BI and just B.E
That's that whole concept within a concept shit
It's my life work
It's the theme song slash sountrack to my whole shit
That whole concept within a concept shit
I didn't invent it really
I just discovered it and nothing is by accident
All of this every touch
Every smell every memory
Love and creation and hip-hop being so relatable for me it was all meant to exist case it always has, always was
Sorta like It's been written just play the position you was born to play
It's a race but it's not a competition
Make no mistake about that
Sure I wanna be the illest emcee or whatever
But hip-hop is only the extention meaning that
I just use these rhymes to celebrate music
There are so many things i want to do to see and leave for the shorties to appreciate that celebrate life
Yes that's what I'm saying
I don't really take anything too too serious
But realize at the same time that none of this is a game

[Hook]
I din't know from one day to the next what's gonna happen or the effects
Who can tell you gotta let the moment progress
Don't be gooled go ya head up in the clouds haven't really yet figured out that eventually you gotta come down

[Verse 2]
New era new beginning new me
Left behind weak niggas negativity
I'm stronger than ever so whatever will be
I'm prepared like McGuyver 2 G
Maneuver strategy politic like Maria Shriver
Dual polarity my persona carry me so i hold my own drop weight like
I took a dump on the throne these boneheads is crappy anyway be gone soon
I'm here to stay
Y'all ain't about jack but talkin bout bein' bout it be gettin sidetracked and rerouted when it's time to spark someting and nothing's happening it's hard to keep my composure and stop from laughing at em
I told you a thousand time if i told ya once hardheaded nigga ya cap should read dunce smoked one too many blunts now ya heads full of puss
Ya just worthless

[Hook]
I don't know from one day to the next what's gonna happen or the effects
Who can tell you gotta let the moment progress
Don't be gooled go ya head up in the clouds haven't really yet figured out that eventually you gotta come down
