[Verse 1: Prof. K]
Light as a feather
The meaning float with the weather, man
Busy writing words, they're just searching for a letter, man
Redder sand
Slighter hand
Greco-Roman world, Pandora just switched to wiser cans
In a combine of picket fencing confines
Hidden in a culture from cherry blossoms to bonsais
Bond-tie, Capulet to Montague
Ending in the suicide of unity among the youth
Among the booth where "pacifism"'s a verb
Everything that you see ain't always of what you heard
This is last of the fantasies
Visions of the Pharisees
Throwing Phoenix Downs for endless amounts of buried streets

[Hook]
Death and Beauty of flowers that don't March
Forbidden behind the pounds of starch
So I throw my head back and pen back and feet
Annotate the world while gathered upon peace
This is
The Death and Beauty of flowers that don't March
Forbidden behind the pounds of starch
So I throw my head back and pen back and feet
Annotate the world while gathered upon peace
This is...

[Verse 2: Prof. K]
The demon-fairies that honored us with a riddle
"Get big until you die or live and be belittled?"
And wondering what was chiseled, just another monument
Couple stone shapes preserving what rocks meant
They wanted to rock tense, 'cuz that words out to get ya
And won't stop til its ripped up
Or rips ya
With a rib-shot
'Til them goals up
Even Heaven put them tolls up.
Tired of falling down? Tell 'em "hold up."
Hold up...

[Hook x2]
Death and Beauty of flowers that don't March
Forbidden behind the pounds of starch
So I throw my head back and pen back and feet
Annotate the world while gathered upon peace
This is
The Death and Beauty of flowers that don't March
Forbidden behind the pounds of starch
So I throw my head back and pen back and feet
Annotate the world while gathered upon peace
This is
