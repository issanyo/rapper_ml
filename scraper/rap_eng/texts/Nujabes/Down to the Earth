[Beyonce Talking]
Delivery me from mine enemies, O God
Defend me from those that rise up against me
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity
And save me from the bloody men

[Verse 1]
I got too much faith in this shot I’m finna take
So come along for the ride you can witness the follow-through
No slave to the dollar but cash is needed for the journey
But surely not the destination’s end
Cuz I got bigger things waitin at the bottom of the net
Tryna get the ball rollin’ like backspin off my fingertips
This is textbook, authentic rap
No lip singin’ off the singer’s lips
I’m climbin’ the path of glory with stairs at heavy increments
There’s no short-cuts to success
Don’t fucking ask me where the escalator is
The revolutionary breath
Will tour de stade around the globe
Before you make it up the escalator kids
I’m down to the earth still grazing up the steps/steppes
But I know they get jealous better catch ‘em goaltending on a star
The shots ring out like Ringo and the Beatles, I
Pray my homies don’t fall apart
Partially cuz I’m home to the whole globe
Been blessed with more than you know and
I got a lot of souls to carry in my shopping cart
How can I only help myself when I got the best health
And I see ‘em brain washed
I won’t let your brains rot cuz
When you spit fire you feel it burning, I
Got to unleash the burden that’s buried in my heart
Underestimated, they don’t believe I’m
Smart enough to Shaka world with the 13 seed
My 13 tracks still hangin’ with the best emcees

[Hook]
It’s funny how the music put time in perspective
I believe I can change a life with one record
Why was I created, I’m tryna find my maker
Tryna duck the evils made by my own creator
Then distributed by the humans, this is not our nature
And blame it all on a devil that prolly don’t even hate us or exist
But your guilt still insist on this figment of imagination
This content flooded kid cripples Satan
With enough righteousness to peel off on a nimbus cloud
See I’m on another level but don’t let the height get you down
Cuz I’m down the earth and the style is way underground
See I’m on another level but don’t let the height get you down
Cuz I’m down the earth and the style is way underground

[Verse 2]
If money make the world go round
I live in a time before the Chinese made paper currencies
So you can’t hide your assets
All I got is this mic and this bad breath
With which I’m killin’ beats
Let’s trade fairly so it’s like
If you wanna save your life, just give me your rapping dignity
I speak for the humans starving for truth
This flavor will sustain you through the desert with a manner (manna)
Of rapping that heals the blind when I’m in the booth
This must be destiny of course
They gon’ hear the sharpest talent but
They hardly get the point - shaven like Muhammad Amir
This prodigy will never be bribed by Satan
Funny how we can grab the coldest whip
And still steer out of gear
No need to fear in the quintessential recital
This is essential to our survival
I’ll cause every tribe to bow down
For a mere sedentary nomad
Let my city go mad for a slow jam
That is a prayer between me and the Lord, this is our romance
You’re very blessed I even recorded these
And wrote ‘em in my diary
And now you finna see that the
Journey is not unrealistic
I’m hardly optimistic and so persistent because I see the distance
Between me and the greatest is minuscule in relation to
The miles of tribulation
From the village of my daddy to "Subs" of Cincinnati

[Hook]

[DragonBall Excerpt]
What does this thing do?
If you can manage to sit on this cloud it can fly you wherever you want
But, you must be pure of heart to ride this cloud
That boy, is strange
