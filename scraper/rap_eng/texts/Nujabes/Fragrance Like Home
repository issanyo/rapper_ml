[Hook]
Late at night in the darkest corner of my mind is when I know I love you
The sirens of downtown can’t drown out the sound of
My heart beating only for you
She asks: “Why do you love me?”
It feels like home, it feels like home
She asks: “Why do you love me?”
It feels like home, it feels like home

[Verse 1: Pase Rock]
Pretty bird a busy bee
In such a word You and me
You know the names and I know the faces
And with that body you’re going places
She’s on her way I don’t believe her
She’s off balance and I’m a Libra
She got talents I’m just a cheater
All that crying don’t move me a millimeter
A fool at heart a sucker for love
Always trying to get over but there’s nothing above
Been Alone forever but could never make the call
Wrote his whole life story on the subway wall
Down and out I barely function
Always looking like I'm up to something
It’s all gone I’m all used up
But still somehow you can’t get enough

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pase Rock]
You’re sticking around, in it to win it
My disposition is cold and distant
And I don’t talk and I don’t listen
Always waiting for the split decision
That fork in the road, where will it lead him?
Off in my own world fighting my demons
And I can’t join ‘em and I can’t beat ‘em
They're hungry for blood and I can’t feed ‘em
Same old song so many stories
The nights were so young in the old days
And they don’t make them like they used to
I still look into her eyes and see the future
Can’t figure out why she’s with me
Count Two Mississippi I’m headed back home. In her heart she’s a hippie
Came alive in the bright lights of love in the city and it’s home, it's still home

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pase Rock]
Listen, baby girl
I got no game I'm just some dude stuck in this crazy ass world
Following my dreams, like this one standing right in front of me
I laughed, she smiled and said hmmmm nice recovery yeahhh
I’m placing my bets. I got that feeling
I’m breaking a sweat, like this is the one night that I won’t forget
I’m glad we met
Later we can talk dirty on the internet and fall in love
Play house, get married and have some babies
Hate each other, fight a lot, get divorced, then fall back in love
And do it again
My cards on the table and I’m playing to win
It’s been such a long time, the raining and the sunshine
The end of the rainbow discovered a goldmine
She’s holding my hand and reality hits
I’m still in the city and everything is shit
