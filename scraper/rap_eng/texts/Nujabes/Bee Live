[Intro: Dolly Lama]
Mm, Mm, I don’t know?
I kinda find myself more in love with the process
Than the rewards, but the rewards are goin’ to come
With time, you dig?

[Chorus: Dolly Lama]
All I’m goin’ to do is take my time
Be myself and be alive
Bee Live, Bee Live
All I’m goin’ to do is take my time
Be myself and be alive
Bee Live, Bee Live

[Verse 1: Dolly Lama]
Big steps I take, as I stand 5’8”
Another livin’ mind, drawin’ my own line
Puttin’ in heart, ether way I take
Always actin’ live, writin’ my time line
Clutch player, Derek Jeter
A team player and a natural master
Mute grabber, Nate Tyler
A real surfer and a true sculptor
We’re all black wholes made of black wholes
Livin’ in a black whole like growin’ CALM souls
Learned that mayne, from Nassim Haramein
Ancient wisdom growin’ to fast to tame
Knowledge never change
And I'm still the same
Always try to have fun
When I play this game

[Chorus: Dolly Lama]

[Verse 2: Dolly Lama]
I went from skate parties at the Schmidt Academy
To island livin’ on the birth place of surfin’
A long way from ridin’ round town, Impala Mafia
Livin’ life by our own political rights, Magna Carta
And I still carry a lovin’ mind, CALM Souljah
When I made it to the Art Park
Everything turn bright that was suppose to be dark
I though school was just for the fools
And then sculpture some how made it all cool
Started to unlock my hidden talents
Like Gohan goin’ super saiyan
3-D composition, metal castin’
Ended up diggin’ metal fabrication

[Bridge: Dolly Lama]
All-all-all-all-all-I’m-gone-gone-gone-gone-do-is
Bee-bee-live-live-live, Bee-bee-live-live
All-all-all-all-all-I’m-gone-gone-gone-gone-do-is
Bee-bee-live-live-live, Bee-bee-live-live

[Chorus: Dolly Lama] x2

[Outro: Dolly Lama]
Just wait and see, to make things happen
All I got to do is believe, and do it, that’s it
The rest is history yo
Crack open my book haha
