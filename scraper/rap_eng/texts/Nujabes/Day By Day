[Verse 1]
When I switch on the TV I see negativity
It seems like bad news moves with longevity
We watch crime rates esculate
And debate on classmates who became just dates
Young girls thinking they're ladies and actin crazy
Just turned 15 now you havin a baby
The daddy ain't around yo he made a quick exit
And sends you no money while he's humpin the next chick
We got young bloods out playing the dope game
Shooting up heroin taking crack and cocaine
Stealing cash from their friends and family
Thinking they top dog but they timid and cowardly
We got kids going clubs to look for fights
One wrong move and kablaw they out your lights
Tell me where these young kids get guns from
I also want to know where they're getting their funds from
It doesn't fears too much the world stares too much
Acting like its gona fade away
But we letting it stay watching it day by day

[Hook]
Day by day kids die every single day moms cry
There ain't a signle day that goes by
When i don't rhyme and show my people
Now's the time to expand your mind

Day by day kids fail or end up being
Dead or in jail it's an ongoing tale
Day by day i say
Build for your future but you got to live day by day

[Verse 2]
I had a friend  who i used to check
In his crib yo he flexed on a couple of decks
And i sill got tapes of when me and him used to rhyme
Only thing is he died back in 99
It kinda hits you when your peoples pass away
And sometimes death is only a glance away
I find that some people need to be woken up
Before it's too late and their life gets broken up
Where the fathers where the mothers
Where the sisters where the brothers sometimes acting like they don't love us
Crews fighting each other from the same borough
20 cats chasing one man so take over
Boy's telling their girlfriends there's no other
Then slap them in the face still you tell her that you love her
You discover that she pregnant with the next mans child
Now you actin wild to go find
The next man who layed down with your boo
You did'nt have to look far he from your check it
Actin stupid now you have to pay
See stories like this happen day by day

[Hook]
Day by day kids die every single day moms cry
There ain't a signle day that goes by
When i don't rhyme and show my people
Now's the time to expand your mind

Day by day kids fail or end up being
Dead or in jail it's an ongoing tale
Day by day i say
Build for your future but you got to live day by day

[Verse 3]
It's such a shame when i see things like this yo
It makes me wonder what's gonna happen to my kids
When they grow up will they even get to make it
Satan's out there trying to take them in the snake pit
In 20 years time will it be safe
To step out of you crib go get your mail from your gates
If you make it back inside alive your lucky duke
Life ain't child's play you think this Chucky duke
Take heed to the words that i say to you
Cos i got one more thing to relay to you
Time goes by real quick so do something
Stop fronting don't make your life mean nothing
Cos the clock won't stop for you or your squad
So work hard and hold down ya damn job
Hope ya taking in the words that i say
Im saying it from living it day by day

[Hook]
Day by day kids die every single day moms cry
There ain't a signle day that goes by
When i don't rhyme and show my people
Now's the time to expand your mind

Day by day kids fail or end up being
Dead or in jail it's an ongoing tale
Day by day i say
Build for your future but you got to live day by day
