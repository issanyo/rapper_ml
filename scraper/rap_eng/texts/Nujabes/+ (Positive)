Positive always, even when I'm low
The path you don't know should really help you grow
So what you didn't get blow from some ho
Its all in a direction we go, how so
Can we detect what the path is
We don't aways really know what the catch is
I light a match and bring fire to the mattress
Of the sleepy bitch we call life, now tell that ho to wake
So i could shake the shit out her and relive all my mistakes
But then i realize what the fuck do i take
From the open ended road if i can't even break
God sakes, thats why those peoples was so fake
Can't even see if I'm good, unless they under presser
I lesson the professor from the rhymes in my dresser
I address the stress with undressing of the whore
That i told close the door and please don't wet my floor
What a disaster, I'm the bastard you can't talk to
Life is a video game and im reading up the walk through
I knock off the ash off the tip like I'm from Pallet Town
I just wanted to fine me a balanced sound
Dudes say I'm talented and to be honest
I need this like a baby needs moms breast for food
East to west i grew, got the best from dudes
Made your heart beat and got your chest to move

This is for my peoples
This is soly for my peoples
