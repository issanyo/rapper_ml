[Verse 1:]
Dear you
Before you read this letter keep in mind
That I was always terrible with saying goodbye
And this is no exception, except this time
My heart hurts every time I write another line
For you and I to work, maybe there's another time
Only time can tell because I can't do it
What I can do is reminisce the innocence
And put a little bit of sentiment in my own music
So I flow through it, with my eyes closed
Fake smiles and laughs, I gotta try those
For the sake of bein' a hypocrite
A smile does cross my face whenever I remember it
And I don't even know what to write
Maybe my pen does, just know I send love
And I know regret is bad for health
But sometimes I ask myself:
Was it somethin' that I said?
Or maybe somethin' that I wrote?
I always ramble in my head
But when I talk, I choke
You know it happened for a reason
Look, but every reason ain't a vote
But whatever, we're still breathing
This is my goodbye note
Before I go, just know

[Hook:]
You're my flower (You're my flower)
You're a river (You're my river)
You're a rainbow (You're my rainbow)
And I go everywhere that thang goes
You're a flower (You're my flower)
You're a river (You're my river)
You're a rainbow (You're my rainbow)
You're my light so I never let a day go by

[Bridge:]
Look, I know we had our ups and downs
And I know you probably look at me unfavorably right now
But I just want to thank you for everything
Because of you, I’m the person who I am today
I don’t know if that's good or bad

[Verse 2:]
How do I start my second paragraph?
A hard dose of reality, gotta take it fast
I know it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth
But, you're so sweet you could even it out
I don't remember what the hate was about
What the arguments until the nights was late was about
Call it selective memory, but baby I doubt
The way you wanna see me goes is in a negative clout
Cause uh, I know it's hard to make lemonade out of sour fruit
But grief is a monster, don't let it devour you, or overpower you
Not for me, I wanna see you happy even if it's not with me
And if not for me, please smile for the sake
Of having your most beautiful trait on your face
Great, now I'm thinkin' about your laugh
I gotta remember it's stuck in the past
It happened so fast, but we know we saw it comin'
It crept up on us, it's not like we were runnin'
When everything comes to an end
We pretend that we'll never have a chance of happiness again
You're somethin' like a friend with a little more importance
So I use my pen to add reassurance
That everything, everything is done
You're my rainbow reflecting off the sun
And the flower in my heart that grew like a sprout
You're also the river that healed my drought
So here’s my song and you renovated minds
Taught me patience in the gift of time
Fuck, I think it’s best if I stopped here
I'm sorry if my handwriting is not clear
But by the time you read this, I'll be gone
A note that turned into a song
And I'm leaving you with this, a little somethin' that I wrote
Please don't take offense, I have a tendency to choke
That's why I better write, so I could choose my approach
Close your eyes, good night, this is my goodbye note
Before I go, just know

[Hook:]
You're a flower (You're my flower)
You're a river (You're my river)
You're a rainbow (You're my rainbow)
You're my light and I'll never let a day go
You're a flower (You're my flower)
You're a river (You're my river)
You're a rainbow (You're my rainbow)
You're my light and I'll never let a day go by, by, by, by, by
Goodbye, bye, bye, by
