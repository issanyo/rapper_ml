The world in my hands, love in my heart, love in my eyes
Straight from the soul, I know i gotta do this for myself
Hold your breath, it'll only take a second
For me to make my music the legend
(For me to get knocked off like a pawn then you could see my message)

I represent an entire generation of minds
The Soul Cypher
To continue the chain I created
When I was enlightened
When I was like six, when I was fighting
Man, I learned how to give back
Ever since i've spreadin my message in rap
Left the stage like i’m wondering when I will get back
Wandering round this world wondering when it will be my minute
Never the one to give up always been the one to get that
Scribblin out these words
But i'd prefer to be layin em on a track with a scratch from a DJ then i’m lost
In your face with a megaphone so you dont forget im sayin em
Lyrical bullets i’m loading inside a nine then spraying em all
Infinite universes reverse when I spit these words
And at first it was kinda like I was playing
But learned to be able to burn these mics and then stay on
Shout out to mason
I still pray everyday that this message will get to play on

I've been sinnin all my life and since i've been a Villain
I mine as well make a killin
Complicated when the times are kinda different too?
I know I can change, but only if i’m willing
You and I been givin all our lives and ever since I took the time
I've been addicted to ripping these mics
Trippin these minds, steppin into different times
Infinite rhymes when i’m spittin you can hit rewind

(Feeling the omnipresence )

I've been spendin all my time in this i've been a victim to wanting to make a difference
This is the Soul Cypher coming tonight, an comin right
And probably for just once in your life


I woke up with a vision . The world was a stage and I had one mission
To give my love back like I gave my forgiveness
Raising my hands to the sky when i’m feeling like i’m giving it something special
This skill that I’ve got to spread peace!
Throughout generations following my feet
I’m chasin after my heart while it's following the beat
And I just can’t stop!
Picked apart  the art of my brain
Now my only way to think is towards the right
Place my body in my casket holding a mic
I’m passin stars above the atmosphere and touching galaxies
With you it's almost like i’m straight invincible . to anything and everything . Within the power jaali found his hour to be many things
A fighter a lover a believer of life
Given himself the power now he’s infinite with power in his rhymes

I've been sinnin all my life and since i've been a Villain
I mine as well make a killin
Complicated when the times are kinda different too?
I know I can change, but only if i’m willing
You and I been givin all our lives and ever since I took the time
I've been addicted to ripping these mics
Trippin these minds, steppin into different times
Infinite rhymes when i’m spittin you can hit rewind

(Feeling the omnipresence )

I've been spendin all my time in this i've been a victim to wanting to make a difference
This is the Soul Cypher coming tonight, an comin right
And probably for just once in your life


The world wants to know. Who am i?
I'm a hope for the future
Looking, if you can find another like me then stand them beside me
You can try to see which ones the greatest
Then maybe inside it you would shine
Both eyes closed, but I see the big picture
My third eye is witness cause it makes my decisions
And with Love will come Pain
And with Pain will come Wisdom
I know this only from going through Pain myself
Is somebody out there feelin the same? Well then come get some
I'm spreading PEACE by truckloads, buildings and then some
I know you might have had it worse than me, yeah probably
But what I know we all could feel the same within this poetry
Take hold of me, let me pull you and show you
Only to be opened to life and knowing
Someone out there going through something the same as you
If not worse then it's never showing
So open up to loving one another and we'll be ever growing


The world in my hands, love in my heart, love in my eyes
Straight from the soul, I know i gotta do this for myself
Hold your breath, it'll only take a second
For me to make my music the legend
(For me to get knocked off like a pawn then you could see my message)
