(Good-Bye)

Verse 1

In my class trying to do my test
Im starring at her chest

Dude everything she do
Everything she says is cute

Everyday fourth period
I can't stand to be serious

Put my eyes on her
Then my mind on her and fly away

Pre-Chorus

Tight jeans, green eyes, brown hair
I can't help but stare

I wish I had the guts to approach you
Because I'd tell you a thousand times that your beautiful

Tight jeans, green eyes, brown hair
I can't help but stare

At you, at you, at you, Baby

Chorus/Hook

The girl in my fourth period class
Has no idea who I am

The girl sitting right in front of me
Doesn't even know I love her

Verse 2

Her clothes her scent her voice
Her laugh her cry her poise

Nose up she knows she's hot
Guys try but she does not

Im so intimidated
Don't know what games she's playing

Her smile blush her looks
Love it when she reads these books (Oh)

Pre-Chorus

Tight jeans, green eyes, brown hair
I can't help but stare

I wish I had the guts to approach you
Because I'd tell you a thousand times that your beautiful

Tight jeans, green eyes, brown hair
I can't help but stare

At you, at you, at you, Baby

Chorus/Hook

The girl in my fourth period class
Has no idea who I am

The girl sitting right in front of me
Doesn't even know I love her

Verse 3

My heart feels dopamine numbness
Stomach butterflies stay flocking in my stomach

Skin tone so unreal
I wish you would knew how I feel

But for now we can just hang

Like watcha' wanna do? Do you like to drink?
Wanna roll fattie? Wanna hangout in the ally?

What do you think?

I'm just riding round crusing, you could only imagine the things I want to be doing

You know I want to fuck you I'm just telling the truth
Don't act like you don't know by the way I stare at you

Its so obvious

Theres nothing stopping us
We can get it poppin hun

Have you yelling my name
As the windows start fogging up

But all I really need is those cute lips
While we kick back and watch netflix

I'll give you all of me
But for now I stare across this desk
As the teacher calls on me

Chorus/Hook

The girl in my fourth period class
Has no idea who I am (Invisible)

The girl sitting right in front of me
Doesn't even know I love her
