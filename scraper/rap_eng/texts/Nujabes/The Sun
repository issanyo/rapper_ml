[Verse 1: Cise Starr]
Joyous
Even before we hear the chorus
Church bells ringing we singing we so enormous
Streamers in the air who cares angels among us
We betting on the future ignoring the stars warnings
So Beautiful amazing we following God calling cause we seeing higher roads
And rose out of the garbage
For what it worth
I see the Earth like a goddess
The sun is the father the moon is just a toddler
Spinning in the milky ways I’m gazing farther
Into the bluish hues of truth fading beyond us
Just taking off the harness and using the good knowledge I’m paying
Homage to scholars that’s showing the way for us
Further acknowledge
We carved from stone and polished
Brighter than Apollo and beautiful like Adonis
Behold a neo genesis Jesus hanging with honor
Siddhartha contemplating and Gandhi’s Mahatma Chakra

[Hook x2]
Children of a lesser God
We rise regardless
Singing at the end of the world we live harder
Writing in the book of life with no author
Wishing the world for the better but still falter

[Verse 2: Cise Starr]
Joyous
Even after we heard the chorus
Church bells ringing we singing we so enormous
We holding up our hands to the sky and cry honest
Amazed in the wonder we wonder what’s up above us
So even in destruction we finding something to love us
Cause life is just a work of art titled beautiful struggle
Titanic in the forces an artist citing his sources
Of inspiration higher like Zion’s measured proportions
Hewn from diamonds
But not the ones causing a riot
But inner gems of truth loosed we are Orion
Maybe Osiris
Rebirth without the science
Never a clone baby I renew spiraling higher
Until I reincarnate into a being of fire
Pure energy states of being I do aspire
Pure energy states of being I do aspire
Never retire until my spirit becomes wiser

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Cise Starr]
Joyous
Still again after the chorus
Church bells ringing we singing we so enormous
We looking to the heavens with sevens up on our foreheads
Praying for world peace and hoping mission accomplished
Within the same breath but death always among us
Rut yet we never have to accept the war mongers
Ringing it in
I just a man chasing a seraphim
Trying to get my blessing of life, yes so let’s begin

[Hook x2]
