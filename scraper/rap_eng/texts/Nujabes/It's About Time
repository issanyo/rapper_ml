[Intro:]
One to the two and uh
Three to the four and uh
Five six and uh
Seven eight
Had to set it straight
Nine ten
And I begin

[Verse 1:]
Against the clock, been racin' the rock
And you won't find nothing that'll be making me stop
So don't even give it a thought - Time can never be bought
We've argued pro it and for it
Only to find that it's all about Time, you can never rewind
Only fast forward and eject, So show it respect
We've all been given a set amount, We've gotta make it count
Everybody seems to think that it's running out
I wake up in the morning and walk into the day to see
People moving every which way, so let's go, okay?
It's me and you Time in life, I live mine by the rhyme
Rolling with the flyest design
I get a move on the rest, I get my groove on the best
Please relax and chill - got no Time to be actin' ill
There's a void I need to fill to make use of my skill
Build and climb to reach heights unattained
Change your mind and don't lose sight of the original find

[Hook:]
You gotta keep it together, y'all, cause it's about Time
It's about Time
Gotta keep it together, y'all, cause it's about Time
It's about Time

[Verse 2:]
Seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, and months
Plenty of Time on the pie to get the piece you want
If you really keep it real, then you cease to front
Put on a show for nobody unless it's on the stage
With a mic, two decks and some hype
Party people in the crowd - let's get counted alike (uh-huh)
It's my Time to shine for my folks at home
Me and this microphone coastin' time zones
Waitin' for the second hand to smack these rhyme clones
And then gimme a pound, so we can dip into song
Time is my homeboy, what y'all didn't know?
We go back to my melody on radio
Even though he's mad cool, he's still shady, though
Done me wrong on occasion, always keepin' me waitin'
They say patience is a virtue, but Time's a mother fucker
Always thought he was legit - come to find he's undercover
Creepin' up on that ass, either slow or fast
And don't make the mistake of thinkin' you can outlast
But don't stop
So keep an eye on your watch, because sometimes it's the time and that's all you got - think not?
Keep an eye on your watch, cause sometimes the Time is all you got

[Hook:]
It's about Time
Sometimes it's the Time - that's all you got
It's about Time
Eleven to the twelve and uh
It's about Time
Don't stop

[Verse 3:]
It don't matter how you measure, sunny day or stormy weather
The Time is going to make it through whatever
It's never endin'
I'm recommendin' that you pace yourself (Like me)
If you need a hand take some help
We all in this together; we can do whatever
Don't ever say you don't have Time, that used to be a favorite excuse of mine
And there's no such thing as free Time, or spare Time, but Time is a constant
A lot of people don't know the Time - until they take it for granted
They don't know what's goin' on the other side of the planet
Over there they got a different time, a different frame of mind
No matter where you are you're still just in Time
Time is everything, most don't understand or comprehend - it doesn't have a start or an end
Just when someone's Time is up someone else's begins
Said it before and I'll say it again
(It don't stop)

[Hook:]
We're just slaves to this word called Time - check your watch
I said it before and I'll say it a lot
We're just slaves to this word called Time - check your watch
It's about Time
