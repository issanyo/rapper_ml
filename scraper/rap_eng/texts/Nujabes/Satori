[Intro: AK]
Hey, yeah, hey, LAWD, hey

[Verse 1: AK]
Only thing that keep me going is the reefa' blowing
Loud like a [?] cops, like a reeper took my people from me, uh
What they teaching homie
Kill 'em then you're equal, pure evil try to deceive you
Then the skies is looking see-through
Division and conquer, this bogus shit is what they plan
You in order, shit feel motionless, time to go choose your game
Can't ignore this shit is potent like when we be rolling dank
Pour a drink, to my soldiers who fallen, we know your pain, uh
Everlasting energy, i inhale and you enter me
Intel for my enemies, my pain can tear extremeties
Blessings every sentence my reflection, your affection, drop your weapon
Bredrin don't you know the universe connected
Try fit in like tetris, your whole life will feel neglected
Blinded by them lies but look inside and feel that presence
My family tree the whole humanity
Puffing dope to cloak my sanity, we golden can't you see
Only chosen few know holy truth, the childs of Judah
Test me, supply the peace like Buddha
Be the lines they glue ya
Trust me, there is much more to this life, the white man trynna screw ya
Fuck it, deep down you know it's right, don't let them try to rule ya
Trap you in that insitution
Start wiht your self-solution
They hit that belt, we born to wealth, that shit don't dwell in ruins
My path will tell what i excel, but it's what i end up doin'
I ain't have no sensei, but i knew i put my heart into it
Crystal shining, darkness loses
Hate that my mind influenced by the bullshit y'all pollutin'
Livin' in a world where we feel the pain, but our voice is muted

Livin' in a world where we feel the pain, but our voice is mute

[Bridge: Mello]
You think progression will be the new obsession
But now we falling down, hands up my brothers on the ground
You ain't never feel the grief like me
If you ever were to live a day to look like me
Then you might know why the rain flows when the wind blows
Let me tell you copper man
Ain't nobody gonna tell me how to live in my land
Yes i said it, it's my land
Best believe it, are you listening
I'm so far, I'm so gone, travel from land
To [?], [?], yeah yeah
Oh, we come in plenty
