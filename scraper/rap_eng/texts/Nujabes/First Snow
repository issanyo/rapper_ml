Everything thatâ€™s alive grows from a tiny seed
You know the little tomato seeds you and Nancy planted in your garden
And how they grew into nice, red tomatoes?
Yeah
*Laughter*
Look Dad

Well like this

Daddy?

Remember how I told you the hen lays an egg?

When the baby grows up to be an old man, and dies
They bury his body in the ground
But his soul goes to heaven

Now look here

Aww I'm bundled
I got on like two jackets on
Two pair of pants
About three socks
A hat
I need a mask, too, cause it's cold
Real cold
