[Opening]
I've been so free, I've been so free here
Y'know, with the album
If there's anything I wanna try
I'm welcome to do it
Y'know, so that's uh the freedom of experimentin'
I heard you was uh, splittin' in last (quinteteer)?
And findin' something on your own?
Yes, I am
How's that
With whom?
I have uh I have several men in mind
But I haven't selected exactly something quartet
A quartet?
Yeah
Maybe uh, several weeks after startin'
...
John, which kinda players do you think have influenced you, if any at all?
