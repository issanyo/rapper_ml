[Verse 1]
I'm tired of being aspiring
The city produce iron men
And I inspired a lot of 'em
But what's to stop me from inhaling this vicodine?
I promise to come back to you in dreams
Tell you what death's like
Every vivid scene
I ain't suicidal, I know how it seems
But if I wrote a note this is just how it'd be
Real clean, no blood, just bad cursive, bad punctuation
My distinct wording
A whole lot of cussing, sorry I couldn't finish
But when you gotta go, you gotta go my nigga
I don't have no complaints
Marginal restraints, pardon my mistakes
And I've broken hearts, some hearts you gotta break
I apologize it ain't who I am today
Today I'm an angel, no wings no glow, no halo
Can't float but I can flow
And no wings made of gold
Just new O.G. cool greys for the road
Where did my friends go?
They was talking like we was so close
I wonder how they talkin' about now that I'm gone
I had a small circle did my best to make it grow
I was introverted, introverted
Watch 'em file in on a monday service
Let em tell it they said I was so perfect
I wish they would've told me before I got exported
Now if you think section 8 line long
You should see the shit in heaven
There's only one John
Divine budget cuts, i'm quiet behind an old lady
Holding the hand of a 4 year old grandbaby
She fell asleep at the wheel, on the 91 last week
That's how she got here
And she ain't doubting her admission
She is just wishing her grandson just wasn't here with her
She shed one tear, I cried right with her
Now I could never see her face I can still feel it
I gotta stop, this shit's getting realer
Cause my granny on the way to get my son from the sitter right now
This shit is real life
That's it
