[Intro: KINGMiDAS]
Mic check (One time)
Mic check (One time)
Yeah, yeah, check (One time)
One time, one time, one time
Mic check (one time)
One time x4

[Verse 1: KINGMiDAS]
Once upon a time there was a king
Grew up into nothing, didn't know he would ever be anything
He was never one to try to ever stand out
But the plan was to land upon the millionaire route
What if then he landed on the billionaire route?
Made all the money in the world, enough to feed the land mouth?
I'm talking every single mother and brother
Father and daughter
Sister and mister, and every other thing you wanna call it
Fuck trains with asbestos (one time)
I'm in the Lexus bumping Kendrick wearing a Stetson (one time)
Feeling like a legend, nigga shit, a lethal weapon
Feeling like machete, Wolverine, a nigga ready
Feeling like a villain in the first Die Hard
Nigga live before you die, don't ever live to die lost
Never live soft
Give it everything you got
Until you gave so much to give it's like you never died off
Check it, now you know who I am
The king coming to you live, what it do my fam?
We'll be back in a second
So let the vibe get you into the message, let's get it

[Verse 2: KINGMiDAS]
Yo, which motherfucker stole my flow?
Yo, get me in the zone
Let me roll my dope
Same niggas say I stole my flow
Be the first ones giving me the sold out shows, huh
The foes they detest it
They be testing niggas patience
They need injections
Recollecting the days we never invented
Now with incentive we presenting the golden message
(One time)
Brooklyn represent, represent
Get it through your head and not the lead
Fuck a deathbed
Gotta try your best to get ahead, be the best yet
That's the case in mind
Save 'em from the place where they mace and cry
Make 'em pump the bass till they dazed and blind
Take 'em up to space, let 'em play and fly
One time, one time, one time for the Samurai King
Gonna shine so bright like we never die (ayy)
One time for the man who got dreams of the top
Never plotting on an alibi
One time, one time, one time, one time
One time, One time, one time (ayy)
One time x7
