[Flowers]

[Verse - Sicily Verdani]

I won't cry when it's raining in the spring time
I won't get lost in the meadows
Just enjoy the pretty (flowers)
My world is spinning topsy turvy
Fall time but it feels like early spring
No nostalgia, I just want to sing
Hit me like a spear
Took some time to lose the fear
Yellow, pink, violet and blue
Sprouting like our spirits do
Fragrant as the scent I wear pon' my breast
Revive you if you're lifeless

[Story of a Sad Boy]

[Verse - Just Lance]

Seems like every time I think about you
I can't seem to let go of the pain
But every time I see the flowers
I think of your smile every day
So now I vent to these instrumentals
And I guess it just makes the troubles go away
It makes the troubles go away
It makes the troubles go away
So first things first
I'm kinda expressive while others find it a nuisance
I find it impressive
Well, a little off balance here to show off a talent
Before you wanna judge me
Here, I'll give you a mallet or the gavel
Whatever you prefer
Just make sure you hear every word along with every verb
And every noun from the sounds of the vocal
This isn't a song
More of a poetic flow
Yo, open your chakras and let ya auras flow
I gotta go, well, meditate
Locked out the Heaven's Gates with the master key in my suitcase
Yeah
