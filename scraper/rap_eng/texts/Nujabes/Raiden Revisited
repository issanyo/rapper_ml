[Verse 1: Kris James]
Bullshit through life and quickly regret it afterwards
A self-inflicted massacre
With more obscure references than Brad Jones' characters
Minus the silly rapper burns
It's okay though cause I bring the heat like Mako
In fact it's a blanco caliente fuego
In this world I'm Draco and y'all just Crabbe and Goyle
Now watch me leave on a high note: Susan Boyle
Don't fuck with me boy-o
Testing me? Well that's a guaranteed trip to the soil
Fuck all the toil and the struggles of life
I'll make sure all my problems get to be short as Phife
And any other negativity will quickly get scythed
Damn right, there'll be no competition in my cypher
Always going in for the kill
A skin-ripping goblin, the black Buffalo Bill
Now ain't I looking dapper?
Wanna be known as an MC not a rapper
But, I'm a slacker full of laughter
Sipping soda setting trackers
On massive password cracking sites trying to hack in Brazzers
Not really down as a bragger
I just start to get that way when I'm out of ideas
But my shit smells rosy
I got a crush on Parker Posey
Now let me pitch the lateral to my brother Kosi

[Verse 2: NK30]
Lateral to flea flicker to fake niggas that pull triggers
Yo, who flippin' and rippin' the mic?
Now it's time to get far insight when I do this
Record companies are like Hitler
And me? The Jew Bear
I could say stupid shit like “Stronger than an aqueduct”
But when them levees break, you pass the buck
So what the fuck?
Yeah, you telling tales like duck
And like Wu-Tang I bring the ruck, so protect ya neck
I could spit tales that buck sails
Have sex with girls from Essex
So fuck Wales
But I keep it all royal when I bang that shit
If my words don't do it for me, I don't go for the clip
That the way I was taught
You either shut up or fought though
I be that rugged raw rhymester!
Peace to blacks like Chief Keef, Dosvedanya!
But lines, I'm supplying them
To get hopes higher than Leviathan
I fought 4 shogun lords at the Source Awards
That got higher than jungle gyms, but it's awesome
How I am on this beat
Because I'm hop as a Scope and elite as a Geat
You cannot defeat
What comes from the Mazant Street
But if Kris crushes like Iron Sheik
I slam like William Regal
It's been Nkosi30...Very Illegal
