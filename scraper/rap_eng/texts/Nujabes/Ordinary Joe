[Verse 1: Terry Callier]
And for my opening line
I'm not trying to indicate my state of mind
I turn you on
I tell you that I'm laughing just to keep from crying
And bringing music when you hear it
Keep on trying to get near it
A little rhythm for your spirit
Oh but that's what it's for
Come on in, here's the door

[Hook: Terry Callier]
And I've seen a sparrow get high
Wasting time in the sky
He thinks it's easy to fly
He's just a little bit freer than I

[Verse 2: Terry Callier
Down here on the ground
When you find folks are giving you the runaround
Get your game uptight
And if you must just take your secrets underground
Politicians are trying to speech you
Mad colour watchers are trying to teach you
Very few will really try to reach you
If you're lost in a stack
That's OK, come on back

[Hook: Terry Callier]
Now I'd be the last to deny
That I'm just an average guy
Each little bird in the sky
Is just a little bit freer than I

[Verse 3: Terry Callier]
Say, Ordinary Joe
Although they say you're just a lazy so-and-so
What they think is real
Is nothing but an animated puppet show
So don't let time and space confuse you
And don't let name and form abuse you
Well let Big Joe Williams blues you
In the light of the sun you can see how they run

[Hook: Terry Callier]
Oh I've seen a sparrow get high
Wasting time in the sky
He thinks it's easy to fly
He's just a little bit freer than I
