[Verse 1]
Got the devil right here tryna strike me a deal
All these snakes tryna strike at my heels
Signed the deal with my soul without reading the bill
I guess temptation really knows how to appeal
Man I never wanted to be lazy
But my sense of discipline is now hazy
Treating every single day like it’s the Sabbath
Maybe I wouldn’t sound so wack if I practiced
Feeling trapped in the basement
Sitting back in my chair with no motivation
While people are working on a Saturday
I’m at home playing games and watching anime
Busy being idle in my fantasy idyll
Imagining myself in the shoes of idol
This is such a vicious cycle man give me a break
Making up for lost time before it’s too late

[Hook]
Nothing’s impossible
Don’t let the devil’s temptations take you ahold
You’re only addicted if you choose to be
I know this fruit’s really sweet I’m sure we all want a piece
But don’t eat the bait there’s a catch
You better watch for the snakes it’s a trap
Don’t you ever leave your heart unguarded
Or you’ll be drawn to the dark by the whispers in the garden

[Verse 2]
I’m never gonna quit at this rate
Been fighting every day to not masturbate
I could’ve stayed out but you know Satan
Saw Eve on the screen then I gave in
Take this lust away man I don’t want it
Thought I could stop whenever I wanted
Wicked games got me hiding in the thickets
I feel so sickened giving up my soul for a couple minutes of pleasure
I’m like the new John Mayer
Sex online man I’m a good player
Told my future wife I couldn’t wait up
Then paid all that innocence that I saved up
Lust has put me into chains, I’m ashamed
Brain filled with thoughts that I can’t seem to tame
Losing my senses every time I get tempted
Like a beast in the heat I’m bloodshot and relentless, but

[Hook]
Nothing’s impossible
Don’t let the devil’s temptations take you ahold
You’re only addicted if you choose to be
I know this fruit’s really sweet I’m sure we all want a piece
But don’t eat the bait there’s a catch
You better watch for the snakes it’s a trap
Don’t you ever leave your heart unguarded
Or you’ll be drawn to the dark by the whispers in the garden

[Verse 3]
The devil ain’t a lie
Don’t listen to the whispers or you won’t survive
I’ve seen way too many people head over to the dark side
Didn’t they ever tell you that the cookies were a lie?
Well I guess sin is too attractive
A real shame since the fun never lasted
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
What in the world does your soul really gain?
This is a message for the fiends and the slaves
The ones who are fighting or continuing their ways
I pray that you won’t lose yourself to sin
Hope is not lost there’s still a way to win
Whether you dealing with lust or addicted to drugs
Maybe always pouring up or being lazy like a slug
God has an escape for those in the fray
I know you’re struggling every day but let me just say that

[Hook]
Nothing’s impossible
Don’t let the devil’s temptations take you ahold
You’re only addicted if you choose to be
I know this fruit’s really sweet I’m sure we all want a piece
But don’t eat the bait there’s a catch
You better watch for the snakes it’s a trap
Don’t get caught by the lot with their bittersweet talk
Or you’ll get locked in your naught in the devil’s workshop
