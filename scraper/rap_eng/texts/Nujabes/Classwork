"This homework boring as hell son"

*writing in notebook*

"I be trying, a nigga be trying but shit madd boring"

*sounds in the background
*woman crying 'they killed ma baby'

"What was that?... Damn!"

(TheDude verse1)
Strategize real rhymes in realtime and real eyes realize real lies in real time
That these guys greasier than epic mealtime
Say they fucking with you and then Hide like Seal's wife
Or like Katie, i was Tom, cruising
In school looking at derri√®res i stay snoozing
Im never gonna change - Throwing in my 2 cents
But i stay germane like a bills movements !
Learned that in social studies, Young Mr. Rager - bumpin Kid Cudi
Black Power Ranger but the mask ugly, plus cops don't like niggas flippin out in public
They love it, gotta have a reason to cuff em
Count em up as bodies w/ not even a number
Rikers gay, and i hate they lunches, but n!ggas gotta eat so the food was scrumptious

(Bridge)
Ayo check it, I remember i remembered i forgot, but how could i forget about the Cops
Circling the block everyday while the D Boys swang - classwork in my bag i ain't touch 4 days
I remember i remembered i forgot, but how could i forget about the Cops
Circling the block everyday while the D Boys swang - classwork in my bag i ain't touch 4 days

(TheDude verse2)
Dude, i was Koonta, fuck Toby
Bumping Oldies, blowin weed on Hawaiian sophies
They told me, move milli and never OD
But just watch me like flat screens. Remotely
Had to steal the ball like Kobe just so i could get the groceries
To support the whole team
Til a bummy fell out my jeans on isle 3
Now every Ak in the hood wanna fight me
Don't think I'd forget thats unlikely
Yeah, the weed mighty, but the Ds Grimey
Thirsty, Tuesdays Wednesdays, Fridays
Getting locked up for the eL in your Wallet
No Parlay, No probably smoking weed in central, i partake
Cuz i got more drive than a car chase
Leme show you how my mind thinks iight? iight!
