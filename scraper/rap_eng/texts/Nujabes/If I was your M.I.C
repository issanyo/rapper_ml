[Hook]
If I was your M-I-C
Do you think you could treat me properly?
Instead of dropping me and abusing me
Sometimes I wish yall would stop using me
If I was your M-I-C
Do you think you could treat me properly?
Instead of dropping me and abusing me
Sometimes I wish yall would stop using me

[Verse 1]
What's going on hundreds of people stare on my direction
There are a few others who I resemble in my section
The house lights dim then I am placed under a spotlight
The others disappear as if my name was Bill Cartwright
Amongst chatter I hear footsteps headed toward me
Oh my god there is a wack emcee headed for me
To the wire I'm connected so I'm unable to exit
Escape is impossible oh no he's got me
In a choke hold somebody make him put me back
Why me black I scream frantically causing feedback
The crowd reacts with ruckus then him and his crew touch us
There has to be away to escape from his sweaty clutches
I'm loosing it slowly becoming suicidal
'Cause of his weak recidle crowds become homocidal
Now I'm trapped here wondering why the others didn't know me
I could've avoide this wack nigga spitting on me
Microphone respect 1-2-1-2
Without a microphone what you gonna do
I say microphone respect 1-2-1-2
Without M-I-C what you gonna do sun

[Hook]
If I was your M-I-C
Do you think you could treat me properly?
Instead of dropping me and abusing me
Sometimes I wish yall would stop using me
If I was your M-I-C
Do you think you could treat me properly?
Instead of dropping me and abusing me
Sometimes I wish yall would stop using me

[Verse 2]
Some people get cocky once they realise that they got to me
Anyone can turn me on but not everybody can rock me
Perpitrating dopeness your presentations sloppy
Too much for you to handle so suckers often drop me
In this line of work I get around more than a little bit
Hearing idiots trying to read rhymes when they're illiterate
Don't know who to fuck with and this foam don't protect shit
Drowning in saliva now I feel infested
Saturated in wackness yall abusing your friend
Don't be mad mad when they sad you can never use me again
I know I'm not perfect and at times unreliable
But I'm the only reason why your voice is recognizable
Don't wanna blow me so you're smacking my head
How 'bout you quit yelling and try rapping instead
I miss being embraced now I'm greet with a strangle
When will they realise I'm to be praised not mangled
Microphone respect 1-2-1-2
Without a microphone what you gonna do
I say microphone respect 1-2-1-2
Without M-I-C what you gonna do sun
