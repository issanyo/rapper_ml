[Verse 1: Kean Revo]
Subliminal messages in my thoughts
Time is running off the clock
Tick tock
My lips locked like a zip lock
Gun shot
Governments Glock
They shootin at everything that we got
Whether a hitter or a quitter
You know ill be cleaning all the litter
So consider, im the spitter
You the baby, im the sitter
Sweet lady, but you know im bitter
Tell me all your worries like im on twitter
Im comin harsh like liquor to your liver
Shedding knowlege im a giver
Flowin like a never ending river
Looking straight into the eyes of a sinner
A kid in disguise, tryna be the next winner
We gotta, realize that real eyes tell real lies
Which just might feel like the deals right
It seems like, they wanna be like, me quite
But im on a spree flight, an elite knight

[Hook x2: Kean Revo]
Enlightened young man
I try my best to understand
This world all around me
And this foreign land
But we fallin in the quicksand
Yeah, we fallin in the quicksand

[Verse 2]
I see these people yeah the runnin at me
They comin stunnin when im preachin the enlightened emcee
Born to lead legacy
I teach them the prophecy, the prophet maken profit for my pocket
And im feedin them with jealousy

Im the reverend, im better than ever and
The president, were stuck in present tense
But my presence in the residence is relevent
Like evidence in accidents
Like evidence in accidents

Youll find me soul searching
And im so certain
The show ain't over so dont close curtains
And these thoughts are oh hurting
Like my growth spurting
Or brainfreeze like cold slurping
Straight murking the crowd
They be like what you about
I said im straight from the underground
No blunder sound, no thunder sound
I just wonder how
I ain't won her now
I just wonder how
I ain't won her now

[Hook x2: Kean Revo]
