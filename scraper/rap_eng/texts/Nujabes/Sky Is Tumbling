[Verse 1]:
Firmament
Under deeper into uncertainty
The unknown has shown grace but yet the 3rd degree
Lessons from the truth moves close
So can you pay the fee?
From A to B cascade rain I hate to be
Voice of the last starfighter I am esquire
Shape of my skull beholds I am the star child
Sightless
Going beyond the song timeless
Write righteous, but what's left is really priceless
Treat me how you wanna be but suddenly you hunting me
Yes the sky is falling chicken little don't you love to be
Screaming out the obvious but never saying help me
Just too much to handle in the world now we melting
Save it to the hard drive I'm counting stars until I cried
Flowers in the final view the world is ending come inside
Graceful
When we're gone the earth will write a fable
Seas will rejoice and the skies will rise faithful
Sun still sets and buildings will still crumble
Meek inherit the earth the comfort of the humble
Just setting the mood come closer I hug you
Say I love you
Right before the sky tumbles

[Hook] x2:
Put it in the atmosphere
Raise it up until we near
Touching on the face of God
Maybe now he's gonna hear
Joy coming in the morning most of us will shed a tear
Looking at the final act
Hoping that we hold it dear

[Verse 2]:
It's the mission of the schism
A minor key in the wisdom
Put it in the chamber and let it go to the rhythm
I move it to the ocean
And break it out of the prison
World full of wonder I wonder if I will live it
Full to my abilities with super high fidelity
Put it to the tide of life but still its just an elegy
Screaming to the closest cloud and watch it as its coming down
Sun setting in the morning while the moon just touched the ground
Crazy, like learning that you bout to have a baby
Two coming together forming a better maybe
Raising the glass ceiling the feeling so amazing
Like music playing while the sky is fading praying for safety
Quiet and deeper soul
Speaking through the notes and told
Deeper meaning of being dedication on one accord
Lets begin
Measure of the moment till the world ends
Space between the breaths is eternity as the earth spins
Smiling as a child, too
While listening to mother's tunes
The weight is on my shoulders but its color is a shade of blue

[Hook] x2:
Put it in the atmosphere
Raise it up until we near
Touching on the face of God
May now he's gonna hear
Joy coming in the mourning most of us will shed a tear
Looking at the final act
Hoping that we hold it dear
