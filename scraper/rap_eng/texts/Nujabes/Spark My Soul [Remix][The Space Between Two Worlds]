[JsouL & Steph singing adlibs throughout]

[Verse 1: Toby]
Walking through the April showers
Through the broken glass and the changing flowers
It seems like the rain is pounding harder
On those who have no way to get out of it
But every face in the crowd
Has burdens that chase them and weighing them down
Tryin' to find their place and how to stay sane
When that place just ain't been allowed
The uncertainty, anger and doubt
Of the violence that makes it unsafe in their town
Some deal with the pain that devours
Most but don't mistake that strength for power
The only thing that stays the same is change
But we too afraid to break from now
Our parents had their day
But now it's our kids that we need to be making proud

[Chorus: JsouL & Steph The Sapphic Songstress] +
[Hook: Inverse]
(My soul)
Let the music be the fuse that'll spark my soul
(My soul)
Let the music be the fuse that'll spark my soul
(My soul)
Let the music be the fuse that'll spark my soul
(My soul, my soul)
My soul-soul, my soul, my soul, and it feels like-

[Verse 2: Tunji]
As I flip the first page on the calendar year
Be right back with another one to bang on your ear
Got the hustle and the drive and the talent is clear
But, see the challenge is to balance it and manage to steer
Through the potholes and the obstacles
On these moonlit streets where the cops patrole
Got a little bit of knowledge, but there's lots to know
When I was cruising for a minute, but I lost control
Had to ease back, take my foot of the gas
Uncover all the pain that I had put in the past
Re-answer all the questions that I shouldn't have asked
And come to terms with the lessons that I couldn't have grasped
When I was much younger, dedication plus hunger
Took us not to the very top, but just under
Now we just trying to break the ceiling
My soul's on fire, can't shake the feeling
You know

[Hook + Chorus]

[Verse 3: Substantial]
I wrote this rhyme while watching my daughter sleep
Wishing I knew the peace that she does, it's sorta deep
At the same time her great grandma is being buried
Some day she’ll be burying me, sorta scary
Ordinarily wouldn’t really be on my mind
But the fact I made it over 20 is divine
So I welcome every challenge that comes
Adds experience, wisdom is the sum
So if I sound a little older than I am
It's because this wicked world forced me to be a man
Really can't say I wish I was still a teen
Kinda like being trapped in the guillotine
It seems everyone wanted to take my head
Instead of building like brothers, breakin' bread
And it became therapy to write on the page
Even as youth departs and I'm comin' of age
It sparks my

[Hook + Chorus]
