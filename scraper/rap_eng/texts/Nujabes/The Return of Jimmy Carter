Its the return of Jimmy Carter, back from the bottomless pit
We run triz nain, never calling it quits
Chewing a tooth pick, giving 2 shits, got a spliff lit
I kiss kiss on a thick bitch, and i got her open
Scoping all areas, various
If I were to marry an Aquarius
I would let the cherry bust, let her bury lust
I'm very rushed, having a scary fuss cause I was smoking on berry stuff
I be coaching a ho, hit a roach like a pro
Returned on the right day, we should be smoking an O
Oh how lovely the return was
I burn bugs, give stern hugs no sherm drugs
You get a turned buzz, you just learned cuz
Your teams a perm rug on a stern thug
Can't discern the son, gay or tough, you decide
You spit the truest lies, I give the newest vibes
I go the flow to make girls say fuck
I should have stuck with 39 regrets gonna suck
Oh well, have a very nice life
I write bright and rolled the dice twice on the ice pipes
Subway cars, metro-card swipes
Red and orange nikes, he was dreaded pouring sprite
On sight, half rican boy dude half white
I could pump crack or grab skates and half pipe
Not even half right, I did my math tight
Made the path sight going over the grass height
I blast mics like I didn't even want to
Bitch rappers you know I'm gonna straight haunt you
Its the return, 39th prez in the house
Bring the bottles and weed out, take 3 ounce
Tree counts, and well party till days end
I wade friends and weighed them on a very great sins
Thats why I thank them, be grateful
Hate pulls, poorly, pour me ups some grapes yo
We are back to destroy and show the world
That we do it nonstop
It's the return of Jimmy Carter
