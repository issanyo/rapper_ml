Hey yo step back, my voice hit the track
Consist is back putting HAC on the map
And it’s about that time to come correct with the rhyme
Get your feathers and climb to make the ladies feel fine
We shine like sunlight and make the beat run right
Making you rock like you only got one life
Left to feel this, stepping with the realness
We deal this now it’s all about the illness
Half-stepping, never that, we roll properly
A couple hundred bucks past go just like Monopoly
We full flash working this game like professionals
Lyrically put me to work, my feet sessional
I got you open while you digest my sound
Bugging out while you watch my record spin around
You love the way that it sound well go buy it
Think about biting my style? Don’t even try it

What you trying me for?
Yo kid it ain’t worth it
What you trying me for?
Because my rhyme style’s perfect
What you trying me for?
You ain’t going nowhere with that
So don’t try it, ain’t nobody hearing that

So don’t try it cause nobody’s hearing that
And don’t try it, we don’t like your weak cats
And don’t try it, it’s getting hard for you to beat this
It wasn’t worth it cause I figured out your weakness

Who’s up next? Who want to test and make me get vexed?
Who wants to test ST while he be on decks?
You know we make people bounce like out-of-date cheques
And take a step back like getting back with your ex
East London sound, incorporate the jazz step
You wanna front son? You’re walking on your last step
Wickedly shifty, it make your crew say
You put my tape inside your box, I’ll make you press play
Erasing cats with their raps when he pass through
Just so long as they never ever diss the class crew
They have to show the most respect for DNAQ
We always giving out the love and never hate you
We never ever came to do this on some quick shh
But when we do you know we guaranteed to rip shh
We make the loud rap cats stay quiet
Think about stepping to D? Don’t even try it

What you trying me for?
Yo kid it ain’t worth it
What you trying me for?
Because my rhyme style’s perfect
What you trying me for?
You ain’t going nowhere with that
So don’t try it, ain’t nobody hearing that

So don’t try it cause nobody’s hearing that
And don’t try it, we don’t like your weak cats
And don’t try it, it’s getting hard for you to beat this
It wasn’t worth it cause I figured out your weakness

Yo this be my last verse, the verse to be the free throw
Ey yo we breezing right through like when the wind blows
But when the kick drum pump we break your windows
You know when shit gets played just like Nintendos
Big up my man Nujabes we make the beat knock
Big up to Strumfield, Dela, and Pete Rock
I got my style on lock just like a cellblock
Cause when I ride on beats I make your legs shocked
It’s hip hop nonstop, we elevating this
So many cats out there will be relating this
Debating this but yo we on a love vibe
Making you jump to this, we on a club vibe
Turn this music right up, I need to hear this
Lyrically as an MC, DL’s fearless
Maintaining myself to start a riot
Think about taking me out? Don’t even try it

What you trying me for?
Yo kid it ain’t worth it
What you trying me for?
Because my rhyme style’s perfect
What you trying me for?
You ain’t going nowhere with that
So don’t try it, ain’t nobody hearing that

So don’t try it cause nobody’s hearing that
And don’t try it, we don’t like your weak cats
And don’t try it, it’s getting hard for you to beat this
It wasn’t worth it cause I figured out your weakness
