[Verse 1]

Awh damn
Took a shot to the head
Another rap killing
Young sly is dead
Saw this shit coming
Like ghost beside my bed
Why am I talking in 3rd person
To show how the scenes are working
Cooking this shit in meth lab
While I send a cutie off in a death cab
Is she ride or die
Or is she just a bitch
Dumb trick
Dumb trick stabbin daggers in my side
Shit Id rather fuck with pretty twins
Either way Im gonna win
If I’m getting it in,feeling like death the kid
Resonating with soul
Killing off all assignments
If throwing off my allignment
The next rap reaper
Avoiding all the ether
Scythe slicing through every single one of your speakers
Try me
And I’ll beat you to death
And who ever comes next
With these lyrics on deck
Don’t get too far ahead
And try to come at my neck
Savage to the bone
Check beneath the flesh
A demon at rest
Thats me at my best
You could try wearing a vest
I doubt itll work
You’re bound to get hurt
Cause once you get a nigga
He’ll fucking start going bizerk
Trying to quench the thirst
With your career in the hertz
Like if you trap rap
Youll get shot down first
Giving you a chance to spit
Your last verse
But forreal I hate trap rap
Bring that 03,04 even 08 back, Real Rap!

[Verse 2]

Alex ruffin, ron, and nep
Qae kag and hari
The only niggas from lower earth
That fearing from what I’m hearing
Send the other underground to the morgue
That were slouching before
Having their fans ask
What you body them for?
Just to settle the score
You will hear them no more
Guess I’m holding a grudge
They thought they were slicker than sludge
Once they’re cleared out
I can run a muck
Or hover on my board and just not give a  fuck
Soon the world will be mine
All I really will say is
Its about time
About time

Real Rap Nigga
Don’t try me or you will get bodied, lyrically
I’m a monster
