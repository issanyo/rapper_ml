[Intro]
Her big blues like oceans, oceans oceans
Big blues like oceans, oceans ... Let's put it in motion

[Chorus]
Her big blues like oceans, I drain them of their tears
She says my love is tainted, exchanging them for fears
Once she ran to me, now she runs from the years
A night for life's strife, fair trade between peers

[Verse 1]
Seductive deceptions to my addictive perception
I take it a lesson to the unanswered question
This depression is caused by his regression
So I lessen the pressing of my latent aggression

Eyes widen, as garter belt tightens
Baby don't be frightened as your load I lighten
There's no use in fighting in a world lost as Crichton
Inciting your lysine as dilation brightens

Surrender to me, in pact we match
Something in her to me, in fact we're twacked
Something we feel in each other that we can't redact
Sometimes we feel each other and sometimes we act

But nothing's gonna hurt you, so tight inside my grip
We can fight the flame tomorrow, tonight another strip
We can play the games we borrow, to hide another slip
I'll bite your name tomorrow, tonight I'll let it slip

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Wanna spend my life with you, but I don't wanna fight with you
Our trade, play games like an arcade
They might shed some light in you, but they ain't thinking wifing you
All day, I'll wait in the hallway

Y'all all say it ain't nothing too serious
Serious-ly? Is it me speaking deliriously?
What she has for you isn't nothing near to this
Compare the airfare we've shared, your Sunny is Cher dear to me

Because you're never near to me, call it a fair trade
In my throat, Air raid, blocks my airway
Drop bombs with aplomb, it'd never scare me away
But till we're hitting holes in one, there's never a fairway

So I'll take what you give me, while you're screaming gimme gimme
And pray for the day that I say it's not a gimmick
Can't help but feeling used but you like all the views
So I'll box, bloody, bruised till you give me the good news

[Chorus]

I must admit, I fight love with no glove
When I'm hugged with no shrug's the time the hole's plugged
The hole up in my heart, or just the hole up in your pants?
No chance, we can't, while we dance with romance

Breathe harder every time that we part
Shadow boxing with myself, Feeling the retard
Swing a hook, take a jab, sing a hook, take a dab
Warfare for fair trade, make me feel like an Arab

You say it's serendipity that I show my iniquity
You dip in me insipidly as I plumb your innards liquidly
You're gripping me, it's my chest your heart is inside
Smile, then slide, as I take it in stride

Loving you, is the only thing I could do
I just want you to know, that you could too
Use me as a crutch, won't fuss, doing the same thangs
Picture' switched frames cause I drink & get brains

[Chorus]

[Outro]
