[Verse 1: Henry Lin]
I need a new start
Through the curtains when the room's dark
Sunrise on calm waters, pursuit stops
Topple like Jenga, everything we've built up
Strumming a chord with one string that's too sharp
In solace reflections are what I'm seeing
Confronting the human that I am being, no more fleeing
Reality and expectations never agreeing
Deprivation hollows out the joy of overachieving
You are the reason, the catalyst
Heated colored magnesium flourishing on the first
Hovering caressed in the gentle summer breeze
Floating like snowflakes, cleansing the tainted streets
Why did you leave? So far away?
And your only goodbye was this bitter aftertaste
Repetition repetition, the phrases I cut and paste
Mainly to convince myself it's gonna be okay
Translucent now, moving on is hard to fake
Realizing that even Hanon needs the heart to play
The nimbus in the distance and horizon start to fade
Like the fallacy, pathetic to believe you're on the way
What would I even say even if you were?
Transition with a blur like when the days begin to slur
Juxtaposing it against the memories of her
Singing as the masochistic liquor starts to burn

[Hook: MINMI]
また夜が明ければお別れ
夢は遠きまぼろしに
あなたを追いかけていた光の中で
抱かれるたび 温かい風をたより
