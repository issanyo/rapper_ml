[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
C.L. is that living legend
Life is like the number 7
I had to walk through hell just to get to heaven
My weapons a microphone laced with a hot track
Knock it back, this is real hip hop, jack
Coming straight out the New Yiddy, My flow is so gritty
Controlling the whole city, the hood is so with me
In fact I'm God-like, put me in the spotlight
Trump tight, if it ain't rough it ain't right so
Let me do the damn thing, I'm putting it down king
You doubt the kid, bring every song they wanna sing
But son, your sleeping on me, this is why I keep it on me
Believe in fairy tales, this here's the true story
I'm world wide with it, why I 'm so fly with it
The soul brother, number one, wait til I get it
With Nujabes now, turntables keep spinning
Love the way I perform thats why I stay winning

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
How I stay caked up, despite the break up
Fans miss my old group, but see me in the new coupe
Lacing up my new joints and measure my 5 point
You study in detail, this is all C.L. Smooth
So hard with it daddy, so nice with it baby
Like screw y'all, pay me, its really all gravy though
No hard feelings, built to keep it moving
Never asked what you were doing, just keep something brewing
Let it bang, let it pop, like you call that copping
I'm going straight to the top
See we do it for the TV, there stands the MC
Back then it made you, now its gonna make me
Lately, see I'm living life so good
Step my game up, got my street fam out the hood
Let me climb up the charts now, all black art now
Nuja play the flute, while your boy get loose, Uh!

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
You take my space, and put it to my face
Solidify my place, in raps with the paper chase
Who got better taste in women and good living
I'm feeling the whole movement none of you lames do it
I just run through it, it's nothing to me, homie
You know my name ring bells, yeah they all know me
Hold down the fort, here to put it in port
They hound CL Smooth to get the street taught
The ghettos we walk, rapper's insecurity
You know I'm soon to be the poster child for unity
They wanna be me, thats all on my CD
A real O.G. living it fast and free
Let me mold you, show you how I spit lyrics
Know all the words and dont speak a lick of English
I stay global with it, this is why I get it on
It's the top dog, return of the mecca don
