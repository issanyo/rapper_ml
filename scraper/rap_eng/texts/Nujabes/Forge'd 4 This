[Bridge: Dolly Lama]
It’s our time to shine
It’s our time to shine

[Hook: Dolly Lama]
We were made for this
And they can’t stop us
We were built for this
So they can’t stop us
We were shaped for this
And they won’t stop us
We were forged for this
So they can’t stop us

[Verse 1: Dolly Lama]
They can’t stop me from, doin’ what I want to
Growin’ my career, stronger than bamboo
The Art Park is where I have made dreams come true
Building these sculptures into something new, Yew!
I got my tools and I'm ready to finally get this degree
My family’s gone be happy cause I'm guidin’ my destiny
I’m a surfer from New Jersey, with my dudes playin’ in the sea
Now I’m a sculptor in Hawai’i, weldin’ piece to piece
Then met all of these friends out here
We so tight you can't cut with sheers
Protect each other like head gear
No tragedies, no Shakespeare
Keep an open ear, never stoppin’ for fear
We doin’ what we got to do to make a career

[Chorus: Dolly Lama]
If your thankful to be livin’ welcome, welcome home
If your thankful to be livin’ welcome, welcome home
If your thankful to be livin’ welcome, welcome home
If your thankful to be livin’ welcome, welcome home
(Happy to be home)
