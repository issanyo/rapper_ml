[Verse 1]
Energy so still in the air
Everybody's running scared
You used to be so care free, used to be so happy
Used to have everything we need

[Chorus]
Now we gotta find the love, find the love
Find the love, find the love
People, we gotta find the love, find the love
Find the love, find the love

[Verse 2]
How beautiful are you and me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Living out our wildest dreams
We can be anything, we can have everything
Just keep the faith in what you believe
Gotta live it up
You only get one life
Gotta give it all
Give up all the strife
Woah, woah, woah
Life is hard and you know
All the hate, it really is too much
So we got to find the love

[Chorus]
Now we gotta find the love, find the love
Find the love, find the love
People, we gotta find the love, find the love
Find the love, find the love
We gotta find the love, we gotta
We gotta find the love
Is it over here? Is it over there?
We gotta find the love
Don't look around, find the love
It's deep inside, find the love
Find the love, find the love
Find the love

[Bridge]
We don't have to look so far, we don't, no
Because it's right there in our heart, right there in our heart, yeah
Feels like it's so hard to find, looking everywhere
Because it's deep inside our love

[Chorus]
Now we gotta find the love, find the love
Find the love, find the love
People, we gotta find the love, find the love, looking everywhere
Find the love, find the love
We gotta find the love, we gotta just gotta find the love
Find the love
Find the love
Find it, find it
We just gotta find the love, find the love
There's a better place for us
We just gotta find the love, find the love
