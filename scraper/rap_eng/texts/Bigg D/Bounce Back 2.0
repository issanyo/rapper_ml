Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Life is real
Life is really, really, real, yeah
I'm always ready for the bounce back
I ain't stressing off
Just feeling what I'm feeling
Imma always be alright
I don't dive back
Everytime it hurts, never heal it
'Cause I got the strength
I keep building

And you know I'll always bounce back
Never turn back
Love is like that

[Verse 1]
Ladies, let me tell you something
We come too far to lose
We'll win this battle
We suffer hard for love

Look what we're made of, beautiful scars on us
This life is what we make it
Won't change a thing
Ain't worry 'bout it, no

[Bridge]
What I been through
Yeah
All the suffering and fighting
But still, I pull through
Yeah
Still we rise and we fall everytime

[Chorus]
Life is really, really, real, yeah
I'm always ready for the bounce back (I'm ready)
I ain't stressing off
Just feeling what I'm feeling (oh)
Imma always be alright
I don't dive back (I don't dive back, no)
Everytime it hurts, never heal it (ooh)
'Cause I got the strength
I keep building (keep building, yeah)

And you know I'll always bounce back (always)
Never turn back (yeah, yeah)
Love is like that (yeah)

[Verse 2]
We be so foolish (so foolish)
If we just give it up (give it up)
No, we're not perfect (no, no, no, no)
Because we all mess up (umm)

Look what we're made of
We see these flaws do love
And each time we get further
Won't change a thing
Ain't worry 'bout it, no

[Bridge]
What I been through (What I been through)
Yeah
All the suffering and fighting
But still, I pull through (I pull through)
Yeah
Still we rise and we fall everytime

[Chorus]
Life is really, really, real, yeah (really, really, real)
I'm always ready for the bounce back (ready for the bounce back)
I ain't stressing off
Just feeling what I'm feeling (woah, oh)
Imma always be alright
I don't dive back (I don't dive back, no)
Everytime it hurts, never heal it (never heal it)
'Cause I got the strength
I keep building (we keep building)

And you know I'll always bounce back (always)
Never turn back (oh, no)
Love is like that (no, no, no, no)

[Verse 3]
I ain't gonna lie, it really hurts so bad sometimes
(Yes it does, yes it does)
Gotta tell myself that everything will be alright (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)

I ain't gonna lie, it really hurts so bad sometimes (I ain't gonna lie, oh)
Gotta tell myself that everything will be alright (Gotta tell myself that everything will be alright)

[Bridge]
What I been through
Yeah
All the suffering and fighting
But still, I pull through
Yeah
Still we rise and we fall everytime

[Chorus]
Life is really, really, real, yeah
I'm always ready for the bounce back (I'm ready)
I ain't stressing off
Just feeling what I'm feeling (I'm just feeling what I'm feeling)
Imma always be alright
I don't dive back (ooh)
Everytime it hurts, never heal it (everytime it hurts)
'Cause I got the strength
I keep building (never heal it)

And you know I'll always bounce back (always)
Never turn back (always)
Life is like that (always, yeah)
