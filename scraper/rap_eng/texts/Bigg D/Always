[Verse 1: Trina]
Alright, he my little running back but he know I'm running it
He love that I'm from the bottom, I be all on top of it
Yea, he buy me Louie, I buy him Gucci sneaks
I got his homies saying "I got homie on a leash"
I'm thinking I want this forever like Drake
Cause I'm his nurse and he my Dr. Dre
I'm in Bahamas drinking Nuvo straight
I told him I'll be sick if you don't stay

[Chorus: Monica]
'Cause just nobody else
That can do the things that you do
I promise I'll always be true
And when you feel the need to love
Let me be the one you're thinkin' of
But I will make it so right
Forever and ever
Baby I will always be there for you
You just run to me 'cause (ha ha ha)
There'll never be another, no (ha ha ha)
There'll never be another for me
I will always be there you baby

[Verse 2: Trina]
I'm riding with him like Obama
Cause he don't give me drama
And his bank account say comma, comma, comma
Comma, comma, I can't be no calmer
It's a honor, take him to meet my momma
C-c-cause he the best, I be all up in his chest
He undress me with his eyes when I'm getting dressed
I'd be so impressed, other niggas can't impress
These are the only words I'd say when I can't express

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Monica]
When I met you on the first day
Wouldn't never knew that you'd always have a thing on my heart
But I gave you a chance and we [?] making plans
Now all I think about is you
Cause of you and I been through the worst weather
And you know love can't get no better
You were everything and everything is you
And I'm never leaving baby, I'll stay

[Chorus]
