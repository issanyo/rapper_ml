[Verse 1]
I see a midnight panther, so gallant and so brave
I found, I found the answers in the thunder and the rain
You made a promise that you would never leave me alone
You broke your promise, and now I'm standing all alone

[Hook]
That's what I get for trusting love
That's what I get for trusting love
That's what I get for trusting love
That's what I get for trusting love

[Verse 2]
I see a fresh a cut diamond, all coal miner's are dirty and cruel
Coffee, Frankie Lymon, why do fools fall in love?
I believe what you told me, when you only said the things I wanted to hear
Now I see, you are a phoney, and you're too down messing, seem to mess sincere
Nah I'm not, nah I'm not, nah I'm
Nah I'm not, nah I'm not, nah I'm
Shadows and diamonds, diamonds

[Hook]
That's what I get for trusting love
That's what I get for trusting love
That's what I get for trusting love
That's what I get for trusting love
