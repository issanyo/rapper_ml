[Intro: Ludacris]
Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip
As I kiss both sets of lip lip lips
Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip
As I kiss both sets of lip lip lips

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I ain't afraid to drown
If that means I'm deep up in your ocean, yeah
Girl, I'll drink you down
Sipping on your body all night
I just wanna take your legs and wrap 'em round
Girl you're cumming right now, my head to your chest feeling your heartbeat, girl
Swimming all in your sea, and you're sweating all over me
Bring it forward don't you run

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't want to be a minute man
Baby you're just like a storm raining on me girl, you're soaking wet, whoa

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'mma kiss it right, yeah, yeah, I'm gon' lick all night, yeah, yeah, girl when I'm inside, yeah, yeah
Yeah girl, you heard what I said, I'm gonna make you wet the bed, bed, bed
I'm gonna make you wet the bed, bed, bed, I'm gonna make you wet the bed, bed, bed
I'mma put your legs behind your head when I make you wet the bed

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You don't know what you're in for
'Bout to get inside your mental
Bend ya back like it's limbo, I'mma make you feel like a nympho
Tonight, oh whoa, you're mine, baby girl
Any time you want it, I'm, ready and willing girl to give it
I start to lick your body, you go to trembling, flip it around girl lemme get it from the side
And can I visit all those spots you like?
Your neck, your back, your sexy lips, booty and thighs

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't want to be a minute man
Baby you're just like a storm raining on me girl, you're soaking wet, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'mma kiss it right, yeah, yeah, I'm gon' lick all night, yeah, yeah, girl when I'm inside, yeah, yeah
Yeah girl, you heard what I said, I'm gonna make you wet the bed, bed, bed
I'm gonna make you wet the bed, bed, bed, I'm gonna make you wet the bed, bed, bed
I'mma put your legs behind your head when I make you wet the bed

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I'mma make your body wetter than ever, we'll get together you can tell as soon as I approach ya
When you're feeling uptight, get it right, don't fight, lighten up like Sammy Sosa
Women call me the super soaker and I'mma soak ya bed to death
How long can you hold your breath?
Asthma attacking, waking up wondering what happened
Making me high like Toni Braxton, you can't deny you wanna break my back in, two
What you wanna do? Look at you with your birthday suit suit suit suit suit
The forecast said it's cloudy tonight and I'mma have your body like bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'mma kiss it right, yeah, yeah, I'm gon' lick all night, yeah, yeah, girl when I'm inside, yeah, yeah
Yeah girl, you heard what I said, I'm gonna make you wet the bed, bed, bed
I'm gonna make you wet the bed, bed, bed, I'm gonna make you wet the bed, bed, bed
I'mma put your legs behind your head when I make you wet the bed

[Outro: Ludacris]
Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip
As I kiss both sets of lip lip lips
Hear the sound of your body drip, drip, drip
As I kiss both sets of lip lip lips
