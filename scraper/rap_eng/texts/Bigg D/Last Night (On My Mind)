[Intro]
Sevon Miles, baby
I'm feelin' real sexy
Shoutouts to the big niggas out there, mane
Check this out

[Verse 1]
Went from chill avenue to bein' on cloud 9
Got to lookin' at a masterpiece that was outta time
Lemme rephrase, timeless classic
I guess she's cute when she get a lil' savvy
Baby girl thick, can't nobody handle it
Like I can and I could never quit
And what's my favorite dish?
It's shawty right there, lil' miss thick

[Chorus]
I can tell you how I feel about you nite and day
You was on my mind
Fightin' feelings inside
I can tell you how I feel about you nite and day
If you knew what I feel about you
Then you would feel the same way too

[Verse 2]
Emotions kicked rocks when I became addicted
Too much force on the hammer, it's the nail, I missed it
She feels disliked from the others around
Try my best to be there when life gets her down
She was on my mind, in my imagination
It's her lips that I really wanna start tastin'
In reality, it's back to the basics
Takin' things slow like Neo in The Matrix

[Pre-Chorus]
You can think about me anytime
Any day, any night
Any day, any night
I can't stop (thinkin' about you)
It's no good (livin' without you)
I just can't stop (thinkin' about you)
Girl, please tell me ("I been thinkin' about you")

[Chorus]
