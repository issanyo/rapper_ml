[Verse 1]
Boy, it’s so crazy now
How I feel about ya
I can’t imagine how
Life would be without ya
No words can explain
The love I have for you
And that’s the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I knew back then
You could be the one
Like my best friend, boy
We had so much fun
And I’m so glad
That you’re my guy
And we gave love a try
It’s real
I hope you know
I’m still

[Chorus]
I’m still into you
(I’m still)
Still into you
‘Cause you can make
My dreams come true
I don’t know what you do
‘Cause, baby, I’m still into you
(And I)
And I want you to know
The deal
I’m still, I’m still, I’m still

[Verse 2]
I lose all control
Whenever we’re alone
In my heart
I count the seconds
Until you get home
I can’t explain how I feel
But without a question
You still
Sending chills down my spine
Like the first time

[Pre-Chorus]
I knew back then
You could be the one
Like my best friend, boy
We had so much fun
Now I’m so glad
That you’re my guy
And we gave love a try
It’s real
I hope you know
I’m still

[Chorus]
I’m still into you
(I’m still)
I’m still into you
‘Cause you can make
My dreams come true
(Oh yeah)
I don’t know what you do
‘Cause, baby, I’m still into you
(And I)
And I want you to know
(I want you to know)
The deal
I’m still (I’m still)
I’m still into you
I’m still into you

[Bridge]
‘Cause you can make
(Hey)
My dreams come true
(I’m still into you)
I don’t know what you do
I’m still into you
(Oh, hey)
(I don’t know what you do)
And I want you to know
The deal
(A yeah)
I’m still, I’m still, I’m still
I’m still into you
Baby, baby, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I’m still into you
(I’m still into you)
Baby, I’m into you
And I don’t know what to do
I’m still into you
(I’m still into you)
(Ho, ooh)
(Hey, yeah)
I’m still
I’m still
I’m still
