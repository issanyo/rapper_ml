[verse 1]
Three o'clock in the morning and I'm still not home
Another night you're sleeping by yourself
I know you cry yourself to sleep every night because of me
And how you feel you keep to yourself
I know you think I'm fooling around, laying it down
Playing house with some other girl
But I promise you, baby, ain't like that now
Cause I retired from the game, I swear I've changed
One day I'll dress you up and wear my name
Cause I need, you, baby, like a mother to a child

[Pre-Hook]
So there ain't no way I'll lose you now
After all that we've been through
We've been through hell and back and here again
Enemies and best of friends
We'll work it out, work it out, work it out

[Hook]
I need you to stay forever
My love forever
I need you forever
In my life forever and a day

[Verse 2]
Coming home to an empty house, table, chairs
Sofa, beds, but there ain't no you
I win at everything I'm doing now
But it seems like I'm losing for you, baby
Oh, baby, oh, baby, feels like I'm going crazy
I don't know what else to do, I don't know what else to do, baby

[Pre-Hook]
So there ain't no way I'll lose you now
After all that we've been through
We've been through hell and back and here again
Enemies and best of friends
We'll work it out, work it out, work it out

So there ain't no way I'll lose you now
After all that we've been through
We've been through hell and back and here again
Enemies and best of friends
We'll work it out, work it out, work it out

I need you to stay forever
My love forever
I need you forever
In my life forever and a day
