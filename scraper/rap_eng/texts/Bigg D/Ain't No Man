[Verse]
Oooh babe, ain't nothing like
Waking up everyday to your face
Never wanna let go, never wanna say no
It's crazy, in deeper than love
It's hard to even try to explain
So all my ladies who know
What I'm talking bout say oh

Oh, it's like you come alive when you hear the voice
No, your heart doesn't have a choice
Oh, and I've had my share of boys
If you know like I know

[Chorus]
There ain't nothing like a man
No, no little boys for me
I don't do rookies, get with me
You've gotta own the team
Ain't no man like the one I've got
Ain't no man like the one I've got
Ain't nothing like a man
Yep, he know he got a Queen
Now ladies if you've got a King say it with me now
Ain't no man like the one I've got
Ain't no man like the one I've got

[Verse]
And the truth is, there's women all across the world
Getting tired... Please (so please)
Never wanna let go, never wanna say no
I don't miss the drama and the sleepless nights
Wasting all of my tears, wasting all my tears
So all my ladies who know (know)
What I'm talking bout say oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's like you come alive (alive)
When you hear the voice
