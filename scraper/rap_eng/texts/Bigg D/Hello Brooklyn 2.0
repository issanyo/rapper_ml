[Intro: Beastie Boys sample]
Helloooooooooooooo!!!!!!!! Brooklynnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Hello Brooklyn, how you doin'?
Where you goin'? And can I come too?
And If I can, I'm a be your man
You could be my lady, and have my baby
And drive my cars, and drive me crazy
Wherever you goin' baby girl just take me
'Cause I'm so taken, if you taken
I'm just sayin' baby, I'm just sayin'

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Like a mama you birth me, Brooklyn you nursed me
Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Berkeley
They said you'd murk me, by the time I was 21
That shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me
Hello Brooklyn, if we had a daughter
Guess what I'ma call her, Brooklyn Carter
When I left you for Virginia, it didn't offend ya
'Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner
And I'm eatin', so much I bought extra
So much so that dinners now turned into breakfast
I only roll Lexus, to hug your road
I love your corners, I'm half your soul

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Hello Brooklyn, how you doin'?
Where you goin'? Can I come too?
And If I can, I'm a be your man
You could be my lady, and have my baby
And drive my cars, and drive me crazy
Wherever you goin' baby girl just take me
'Cause I'm so taken, if you taken
I'm just sayin' baby, I'm just sayin'

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne (Jay-Z)]
Hello Brooklyn, what's your story?
She said she eatin' on the run but she ain't N.O.R.E
She said she got a man but he ain't worried
But baby I'ma have to rob him like Horry
She said she love B.I.G. and she like 2Pac
And when I said Jay-Z she say "It's The Roc!"
And I'ma leave it like this, like this like that
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Have you seen her?
And when she tell you somethin' you better believe her
She told me she like my New Orleans demeanor
And so I said goodbye Katrina, and hello Brooklyn
But baby you are, the sweetest sight eyes could see
I said hello Brooklyn
But baby I hope you never say goodbye to me
I said hello Brooklyn, buh-buh-baby you are so damn fine to me
And I remember the time (time), place (place) and the weather
On the day you said hi to me and let's say hello Brooklyn

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Brooklyn you crazy, look how you made me
Razor blades in my mouth walkin' 'round behavin'
All demented black hoodies and Timberlanded
Always schemin', "you see the gleam on that niggas pendant?"
Hello Brooklyn, you bad influence, look what you had me doin'
But I ain't mad at you, look at my attitude
It says my life's too real, check out my ice grill
Baby I'm cold as ice, like I'm from Brownsville
But my Bed's in the Stuy though I'll lie flat in your bush
'Til we smoke a C.I., what up to the boy B.I
You know I handle B.I., I don't half-step on the 'caine
Ask the dreads 'bout I, how you gwaan so?
She like it hardcore, so I grind slow
Iller than Albee Square Mall back in the 9-0
My fine ho, we got some victims to catch
So in a couple years baby I'ma bring you some Nets

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Hello Brooklyn, how you doin'?
Where you goin'? And can I come too?
And If I can, I'm a be your man
You could be my lady, and have my baby
And drive my cars, and drive me crazy
Wherever you goin' baby girl just take me
'Cause I'm so taken, if you taken
I'm just sayin' baby, I'm just sayin'

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And hello Brooklyn, buh-buh-baby you are
The sweetest thing eyes could see
Hello Brooklyn, baby I hope
You never say goodbye to me
I said hello Brooklyn, buh-buh-baby you are
So damn fine to me
But I remember the time, place, and the weather
On the day she said goodbye to me
So I say hello Brooklyn
