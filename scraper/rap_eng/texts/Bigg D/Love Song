[Chorus 1]
Your love’s got me so high
It’s like I’m on a cloud
The way you put it down
And I just can’t get enough
Your love’s got me so high
It’s like I’m on a cloud
The way you put it down
I think I’m fallin’ in love

[Verse 1]
Boy, doped up on your love
And I don’t ever wanna give this up
And I don’t ever wanna get caught up
With another dude except for you
(You’re my addiction)
Try to make me go to rehab
But I said no, no, no
Ha
I said, try to make me go to rehab
And I say no, no, no

[Chorus 2]
I just wanna be your favorite
(Hey)
I just wanna be the one that you call
When you’re fadin’
I just wanna be your favorite
(Hey)
I just wanna be the one that you call your baby
I just wanna be your favorite
(Hey)
I just wanna be the one that you call
When you’re fadin’
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be the one that you call your baby

[Chorus 1]
Your love’s got me so high
(Got me so high)
It’s like I’m on a cloud
The way you put it down
(Boy, you got)
And I just can’t get enough
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Your love’s got me so high
(So high)
It’s like I’m on a cloud
The way you put it down
I think I’m fallin’ in love

[Verse 2]
You got me wrapped around your finger
(Yeah)
And I won’t let you down
(I won’t let you down)

(Oh, ooh, oh)
Just keep lovin’ me the way

Oh, you drive me crazy

Every little step you take
(Oh, ooh)

[Chorus 2]

When you’re fadin’

[Chorus 1]
Your love’s got me so high

And I just can’t get enough
Your love’s got me so high

(Feel like I’m on a cloud)
It’s like I’m on a cloud
(The way you put it down)

(Down, down)
I think I’m fallin’ in love

[Bridge]
I just wanna be your favorite
The one you call when you’re heated
And you’re needed on your day shift
The only one you call your baby
You need a freak in the bed
In the streets I’m a lady
(Yeah)
I see you got a lot but are needier
(Yes)
I got your name painted on my heart like graffiti
Makin’ love off my CD
While we’re runnin’ through the city
Got my shades on
On my [?] lookin’ pretty
Yeah
Love it when you kiss me
Feels like all my problems melt away
And I’m addicted to the feelin’
Likin’ how my heart is dealin’
‘Cause of you, my baby
And I love it when you need me
(Need me)
‘Cause I wanna give you everything
(Everything)
And I’ll never, never, never stop
No, ooh, yeah

[Chorus 1]
Your love’s got me so high
(High)
It’s like I’m on a cloud
(Ooh)
The way you put it down
And I just can’t get enough
Your love’s got me so high
It’s like I’m on a cloud
(Got me on Cloud 9 now)
The way you put it down
It’s like I’m fallin’ in love

[Outro]
I’m so lit off you
And I don’t want nobody else
I’m hooked on your love
(Hooked on your love)
And I just wanna be with you
And I can see myself with no one else
Baby, I’m yours
(Baby, I’m yours)
