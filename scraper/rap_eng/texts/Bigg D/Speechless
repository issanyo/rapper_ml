[Verse 1]
I will never be same
I will never love again
If you ever run from love
I can't even lie to me
It's so clear for me to see
Girl I already know you're the one
Nowhere to hide it
No chance to fight it
Now I know that it will never die
First I didn't believe it, no
Now I can see it
I got nothing to say

[Chorus]
You lift me up, yeah, you take me high
And you're all I need to refine me
You lift me up, yeah, you take me high
And inside of me there is no gravity
You leave me speechless, girl I'm speechless
Speechless, love me speechless
You leave me speechless, girl I'm speechless
Speechless, love me speechless

[Verse 2]
You're so surreal to me, yeah
An unsolved mystery
And I already know you're the one
No reason to explain
To leave you will be insane
I can ever run from love
Nowhere to hide it
No chance to fight it
Now I know that it will never die
First I didn't believe it, no
Now I can see it
I got nothing to say

[Chorus]
You lift me up, yeah, you take me high
And you're all I need to refine me
You lift me up, yeah, you take me high
And inside of me there is no gravity
You leave me speechless, girl I'm speechless
Speechless, love me speechless
You leave me speechless, girl I'm speechless
Speechless, love me speechless

Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh love
Love

You leave me speechless, love I'm speechless
Speechless, love me speechless
You leave me speechless, love I'm speechless
Speechless, love me speechless
You leave me speechless, love I'm speechless
Speechless, love me speechless
