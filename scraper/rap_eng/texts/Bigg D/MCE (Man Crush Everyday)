[Verse 1]
Wake up and think of you like damn
What the hell have you done to me now
Have you seen yourself in the mirror
Shake my head and look at you
Perfect picture, perfect picture
Them other girls they want the pearls
But fly away, fly away
That baby, that baby, I been on you lately

[Pre-Chorus 2x]
You shot me down
I go bang, bang
You ain't know you got me
You give me butterflies
(inside, inside, inside)

[Chorus]
They say
Who got you feeling this way
Who got you feeling this way
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Who got you feeling this way
Who got you feeling this way
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Man crush everyday

[Verse 2]
You got exactly what I need
You know, I want you
(Want you, want you, want you baby boy yeah)
Looking at your pictures
Wishing I could be with you
Tell me how long I have to wait
Baby, make no mistake

[Pre-Chorus 2x]
You shot me down
I go bang, bang
You ain't know you got me
You give me butterflies
(inside, inside, inside)

[Chorus]
They say
Who got you feeling this way
Who got you feeling this way
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Who got you feeling this way
Who got you feeling this way
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Man crush everyday

[Bridge]
That's my baby (that's my baby), everyday
Even though I've never seen him face to face
Love Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday (Everyday)
That's about a week to keep that boy
You give me butterflies
You must be a caterpillar [?]
Liking your ID pictures
But I just can't wait to see you
I don't see nobody
I'm Stevie up on the Gram
My girls like hot damn
You love 'em like that's your man

[Chorus]
They say
Who got you feeling this way
(Who got you feeling this way)
Who got you feeling this way
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
(He stole my heart)
Who got you feeling this way
(I love you baby)
Who got you feeling this way
I tell 'em that's my man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
Man crush everyday
(everyday everyday everyday)
