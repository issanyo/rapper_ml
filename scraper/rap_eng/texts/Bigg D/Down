[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I wanna get down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
Get down
We can get down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh, Mr. West is in the building, children, ladies
Call the shrink up, they about to go crazy
Hold your drinks up like you was celebrating
Hold your guns if they is hella hating
I'm so clean and them, they got rabies
I can see it through the lens of my Raybe-
Ans, Wayfarers, mmmhmm
'Ye do you play fair? mmmnnnn
Grab your remote, for the reason they made TiVo
Snap the Nikon's with the icons with Nike's on
I heard you like to do it with the lights on
But I really make babies when the mics on
Check out all my kids, that bought all my cribs
Got me out of that apartment, you have got to pardon him
I am so retarded with a spit like a retarded kid that spits
Oops, I ain't mean to say that shit
I told my homie Chris, these chicks is dangerous
You need a girl that's A-List, not one that's just barely made it on a list
'Cause from wall to wall, we got it poppin' right now
It's a hundred girls, tryna get down down down

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Baby girl, gotta tell you
Seen you somewhere before, you look familiar
You had a red shirt, Gucci slacks, and a Gucci bag to match it
Tell me you remember that baby girl
But lady never mind that
Can I take you out later? And here's my contact
Can you do me this favour? Let me spend this paper?
On you cause it's just sitting and let's just get it and go

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Let me, let me
Guarantee, guarantee
I'll make your day
Okay

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I wanna get down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
Get down
We can get down

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
The way I see it girl, you a perfect ten
That's why I'm all on you baby, you got me wondering
What to do, what to say, don't want to come off lame
Girl do you got a man? Better yet girl, what's your name?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Just let me, let me, guarantee, guarantee
I'll make your day, okay
Now if you with it, shawty, shawty, let me, let me
Take you bad away, baby can we dream, just for today?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I wanna get down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
Get down
We can get down
I wanna get down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
Get down
We can get down
I wanna get down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
Get down
We can get down
I wanna get down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
Get down
We can get down

[Outro: Chris Brown]
For all my ladies, sexy ladies
I wanna get down with y'all
