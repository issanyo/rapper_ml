[Verse 1]
It felt like December in the bedroom last night
I still can't remember what led to that fight
But we both said some things
That we didn't mean
Once again
Your pride made it hard to say you're sorry first
And the look in my eyes, sayin’ words might make it worse
But we still said some things
That we didn't mean
Once again, again

[Chorus]
Oh, I don’t wanna fight
Don't need to be right
At the end of the day I just wanna love
And be loved in return
(Let’s go back)
Oh, I wanna start over
I just wanna fall
Knowing you'll catch me first
(Let’s go back)
Oh, can we go back to when love didn't hurt?

[Verse 2]
Me as much as that look in your eyes
It felt like two enemies on the front line
But the terrible things
We still didn't mean
Once again
Whoa, whoa
I’m tired of the anger
Said I'm tired of the tears
(So tired)
My heart’s too invested in too many years
‘Til the stupid things that we never mean hurt again

[Chorus]
Oh, baby I
Don’t wanna fight
Don't need to be right
At the end of the day I just wanna love
And be loved in return
(Let’s go back)
Oh, I wanna start over
I just wanna fall
Knowing you'll catch me first
(Let’s go back)

[Bridge]
Oh, I wanna start over
Back to when love
Was kissing and hugging
Makin’ sweet love all night long
Rubies and diamonds
Sex in the shower's all I want
Luther and candles
Stevie and Merlot
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh

[Outro]
Just wanna love
And be loved in return
(Let’s go back)
Oh, I wanna start over
I just wanna fall
Knowing you’ll catch me first
(Let’s go back)
Oh, can we go back to when love didn’t hurt
Oh, Oh, Mm, Mm, Mm
Back to when love didn’t hurt
Ho
Didn’t hurt
Oooh
