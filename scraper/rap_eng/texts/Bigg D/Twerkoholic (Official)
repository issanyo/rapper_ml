(Intro):
She's a twerkoholic
She's a twerkoholic
She's a twerkoholic
She needs me to get her started
My love is gonna get her faded
She said my love is so intoxicating

(Chorus)
Ride, ride
Ride my love and baby
Ride my love and don't stop
Baby, ride, ride
Ride my love and baby
Ride my love and don't stop
Baby

(Verse 1)
If you stay with me, I'll do this verse
I'll be your designated driver girl
I wanna take you home
Straight to the bed lets skip the pillow talk
I know that I deserve you
Baby, show me what that twerk do
Baby, show me what that twerk do
Show me how you work, you too
Hold up girl, just wind it slow
Imma take you where you tryna go
She gone need rehab for sure
Cause everywhere that she go
Hold up, let me clear my throat

(Pre-Chorus):
She's a twerkoholic
She's a twerkoholic
She's a twerkoholic
She needs me to get her started
My love is gonna get her faded
She said my love is so intoxicating

(Chorus)
Ride, ride
Ride my love and baby
Ride my love and don't stop
Baby, ride, ride
Ride my love and baby
Ride my love and don't stop
Baby

(Verse 2)
Shawty turned up to the max
All I want to do is throw stacks
Baby go ahead and look back
Gone and look back at it
Girl you got it
Show them other girls that you know just what you are
Hold up girl, just wind it slow
Imma take you where you tryna go
She gone need rehab for sure
Cause everywhere that she go
Hold up, let me clear my throat

(Pre-Chorus):
She's a twerkoholic
She's a twerkoholic
She's a twerkoholic
She needs me to get her started
My love is gonna get her faded
She said my love is so intoxicating

(Chorus)
Ride, ride
Ride my love and baby
Ride my love and don't stop
Baby, ride, ride
Ride my love and baby
Ride my love and don't stop
Baby

(Bridge)
Ooh, Ah
Girl the way you stop and you go
And I would do whatever
Because, when I come around you lose control
Hold up girl, just wind it slow
Imma take you where you tryna go
She gone need rehab for sure
Cause everywhere that she go
Hold up, let me clear my throat

(Pre-Chorus):
She's a twerkoholic
She's a twerkoholic
She's a twerkoholic
She needs me to get her started
My love is gonna get her faded
She said my love is so intoxicating

(Chorus)
Ride, ride,(ride baby)
Ride my love and baby
Ride my love and don't stop.(baby ride it)
Baby, ride, ride
Ride my love and baby,(oh whoa, whoa, whoa)
Ride my love and don't stop
Baby
