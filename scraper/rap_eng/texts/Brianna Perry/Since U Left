[Intro: Tayla Parx]
I been doing much better
No doubt about it no....

[Brianna Perry]
Who you gon' kiss like that
Who you gon' miss like that
Take her round the world fly trips don't pack
Me? You lost that
Cross my heart, fuck you, it's like that

[Tayla Parx]
Ahh, since you, since you, since you
(Brianna)
Ahh
Since you, since you, since you
Since you left, ahh
Since you, since you, since you
Since you left, ahh

[Verse 1: Brianna Perry]
Now say what? Stay who?
That ain't the case boo
Long list of niggas that been waiting to replace you
Lie to your face but behind your back
These hoes ain't loyal, may I remind you, fact
Cause I move forward
Do you know how many niggas just fiend for it
Do you know how many wanna pay the fee for it
Back on the market, keep missing me, boy get on your target (Pow!)

[Pre-Hook: Brianna Perry]
We ain't together so, miss it forever we, had to part
We coulda did it together
And I know I had to live with the regret
So I had to put you to the left, to the left

[Hook: Tayla Parx]
Since you left
I been doing much better
No doubt about it no
Since you left
I been feeling like money, money, money, oh
Since you left
Since you, since you, since you
Since you left I put you to the left, step
Since you left, ahh

[Verse 2: Brianna Perry]
Live with the fact you did me wrong forever
Good girl goes bad then she gone forever
To be honest, I got me myself & I
Me Myself & I with this money on the side
A promise gets broken without being held
See, that's why a bitch stick in touch with Chanel
See, that's why a bitch can't love these niggas
Wouldn't be fucked up it wasn't for these niggas

[Pre-Hook: Brianna Perry]
We ain't together so
Miss it forever if you
Played your part we coulda did it together (me & you)
Now you gotta learn to live with regret
So I had to put you to the left, to the left

[Hook: Tayla Parx]
Since you left
I been doing much better
No doubt about it no
Since you left
I been feeling like money, money, money, oh
Since you left
Since you, since you, since you
Since you left I put you to the left, step
Since you left, ahh

[Bridge: Brianna Perry & Tayla Parx]
Good girls go bad then they gone forever
Good girls go bad then they gone forever
Watch a first class bitch leave a nigga in coach

[Pre-Hook: Brianna Perry]
We ain't together so
Miss it forever if you
Played your part we coulda did it together
Now you gotta learn to live with regret
So I had to put you to the left, to the left

[Hook: Tayla Parx]
Since you left
I been doing much better
No doubt about it no
Since you left
I been feeling like money, money, money, oh
Since you left
Since you, since you, since you
Since you left I put you to the left, step
Since you left, ahh
