[Intro: Brianna Perry]
Yeah, yeah
Free game, free game
Way back, drop top, yeah

[Chorus: Brianna Perry]
If your nigga comin' home pissed off for no reason
He probably caught his side bitch cheatin'
When the bitch start actin' up, talkin' 'bout she leavin'
She probably with her side nigga, cheatin'
When that nigga start comin' home late in the evening
He probably with his side bitch, cheatin'
If she tell you that's her homie but you never get to meet him
She probably with her side nigga, cheatin'

[Verse 1: Brianna Perry]
I'm at home with these kids like a fool (Fuckin' fool)
He don't even pick they ass up from school (Yo, what you doin'?)
This nigga joyridin', all in my shit, he a cheater
He keep talkin' 'bout that's a cousin, where she at? I wanna meet her
I'ma beat her (Pussy ho)
Do your dirt but keep it gangster with your paper (One hundred)
That's why all these other bad bitches single (Mhm)
'Cause they ain't havin' that (Uh-uh)
So when a nigga hit my DM's, send that picture through the Snap
I'm gettin' summertime fine for that new new year
Any nigga swappin' bitches with the crew too, yeah
All that layin' up cryin' shit, actin' like a soft bitch (Stop)
Get your stupid ass up and cheat back, bitch

[Chorus: Brianna Perry]
If your nigga comin' home pissed off for no reason
He probably caught his side bitch cheatin'
When the bitch start actin' up, talkin' 'bout she leavin'
She probably with her side nigga, cheatin'
When that nigga start comin' home late in the evening
He probably with his side bitch, cheatin'
If she tell you that's her homie but you never get to meet him
She probably with her side nigga, cheatin'

[Verse 2: Ball Greezy & Brianna Perry]
See that's your fuckin' problem (Huh?)
You don't never wanna listen
Everybody on Facebook know my business
You don't never give me head (Never)
And you don't never let me fuck (Never)
We gotta argue every time before I nut (Goddamn)
While you in that king-sized, smellin' good, sleep in peace
I'm in the motherfuckin' streets with that heat, sellin' deep
You ain't never ever ask me how my day went (Never)
(What you mean?)
Ah, go'n on with that fake shit
And I can't even take a shit without you think I'm with a bitch (Goddamn)
Accusin' me for nothin' 'bout nothin' make me pissed
Answer this, what's the last time we kissed? (Huh?)
Goddamn, you make me sick

[Chorus: Brianna Perry]
If your nigga comin' home pissed off for no reason
He probably caught his side bitch cheatin'
When the bitch start actin' up, talkin' 'bout she leavin'
She probably with her side nigga, cheatin'
When that nigga start comin' home late in the evening
He probably with his side bitch, cheatin'
If she tell you that's her homie but you never get to meet him
She probably with her side nigga, cheatin'
