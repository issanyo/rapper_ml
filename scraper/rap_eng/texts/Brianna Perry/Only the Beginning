[Intro]
Cheeze
Look
Look

[Chorus]
Tropicana seven tray, wet paint, I do what your bitch can't
Fish bowl, fish tank, I be where your bitch ain't
Young bitch, pop shit, slidin' through to poke a beam
Flow sick, Heat game, fuck around and coach the team, yeah
I'm on that Henny, damn, that's one too many, yeah
My shoe's Christian but I'm still sinnin', yeah
These bitches mad 'cause I'm winnin'
Used to bend it 'round the city, ho, this only the beginning, yeah

[Verse 1]
I bring that heat to your city
These bitches hatin' 'cause I get it
Don't fuck with hoes, I ain't with it
Snatch the top off of the Bentley, let them bitches see who winnin', yeah
Stunt on all them bitches now, poppin' like a collar now
Gucci runners drippin', I got snakes all on my collar now
Fuck it, pop a bottle now, fuck it, I'm a model now
Catch your nigga lookin', bitch, you're lucky I don't holler now
G5, I'm goin' live, yeah
Homicide when I'm with the guy, yeah
I'm rockin' shorts, I'm showin' my thigh
I got the city on my back, bitch, 305

[Chorus]
Tropicana seven tray, wet paint, I do what your bitch can't
Fish bowl, fish tank, I be where your bitch ain't
Young bitch, pop shit, slidin' through to poke a beam
Flow sick, Heat game, fuck around and coach the team, yeah
I'm on that Henny, damn, that's one too many, yeah
My shoe's Christian but I'm still sinnin', yeah
These bitches mad 'cause I'm winnin'
Used to bend it 'round the city, ho, this only the beginning, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hop in, spend a dollar, fuck a check up in Prada
Pop a nigga like a bottle if we're havin' some problems
Cut you up like a barber
Switchin' lanes down Biscayne
Hit the gas on 'em, full throttle
Perfect timin' on 'em, look how I'm shinin' on 'em
Check out my watch, look how I'm glistenin' when them diamond on 'em
Hope you shy, shut it down, I ain't fuckin' 'round
I pop up on you at the Grammys, have your goofy ass down
Brand new Lamborghini, top off, in my bikini
Disappear like a genie, come and check with the gang
Chanel boots in the rain, triple Balmain
Powder pink, don't come through, hoggin' the lane

[Chorus]
Tropicana seven tray, wet paint, I do what your bitch can't
Fish bowl, fish tank, I be where your bitch ain't
Young bitch, pop shit, slidin' through to poke a beam
Flow sick, Heat game, fuck around and coach the team, yeah
I'm on that Henny, damn, that's one too many, yeah
My shoe's Christian but I'm still sinnin', yeah
These bitches mad 'cause I'm winnin'
Used to bend it 'round the city, ho, this only the beginning, yeah

[Outro]
This only the beginning
You now this only the beginning
You know this only the beginning, man
Brianna Perry, fat checks
Got all these racks in my pocket, man
