BP, ready?
Live from the bad bitch headquarters
Birthing these hoes, I got four daughters
I'm the realest, what I got to show for it
Let Jesus take the will, and I'll show for it!
Peter Piper pick Perry the Push
But I'm the shit, no SPEAK or flush
And now I don't mean to be over their heads
Running, spitting the verses like I'm bunking the beds
Bounce, I could put you late for a stand by
Don't need security, I move like a samurai!
Broke and envious, they're looking with a green eye
I don't roll up, but I ain't high!
Paparazzi, that's what the fame buy
Suited for the game, but it's no tie!

Hook:

Reporting live from the jungle
Now how many real hoes wanna rumble?
Reporting live from the jungle
Now how many real hoes wanna rumble?
Wanna rumble with the beat, huh, huh, huh?
Wanna rumble with the beat, huh, huh, huh?

Never stop, never bow
Can't school me with financial holds
I was bump beneath, I was copping hoes
(See again) It's my time so I'm clocking hoes
You can only do what I let you
Who the fuck are you to say I never impressed you?
Filthy mouth, need POTTY TRAINING
The menace I'm, I could tell from my body LANGUAGE
Anybody could get it, ask'
When I hum for the crown, bitches better bow down
Cause I'm only 21 with a hell of a style
I'm in the bank, you in denial!
I'm too nice to ever PLAY nice
Give advice, look at the bigger picture not the likes!
If you nigga a hoe then you a dyke
I'm provocative but they don't wanna fight

My appearance don't need no clearance
Good critic, nothing in the name of my appearance
Check my balance, check my merits
I can't be broke like 7 (divide that!)
Get pimping, man, he in the peddy!
Keep yourself together, bitch, that's peddy!
I can't socialize with chicks, that's peddy
Fine women like me, pink plenty (noup)
Ain't many, my ego ain't many
All head stincky, respect gotta get me
Rap then again, too many gimmicking
I just put the words to the beat, but I ain't industry!
Just put the words to the beat, but I ain't industry!

[Outro:]
This is not a test
You wagging and get happening
I double dare you
Big Oprah could tell you to do it!
Stop!
