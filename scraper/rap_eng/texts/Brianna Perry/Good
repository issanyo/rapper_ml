[Intro: Brianna Perry & *Trey Songz*]
Welcome home
Uh-huh
*It's good, it's good*
Brianna
*It's good, yeah-yeah*

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I know she can't leave me alone
And I can't wait to see how low she can go
I love how it look but is it good
I can tell she like me cause she dropped it and said
Baby it's goo-oo-oo-oo-ood, goo-oo-oo-oo-ood
Goo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ood
Goo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ood
I love how it look but is it good
Good, good, good

[Verse 1: Brianna Perry]
So good
Gettin' stalkers
With a body looking like Ms. Parker
That bidness, my offer
She knock off, imposters
You hang me up in your locker
You check me out, you doctor
So fly, wanna swat her when you spot her
Money Team like I could've been a boxer
Talk dirty to me on Voxer
Need a bad boy with a chopper
But I'ma good girl talk proper
Benihan, steak with the lobster
Love it, love it, love it when you eat it
Cause I really mean it, I repeat it
Pic Stitch him so conceited
Tell that other chick she so not needed

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I know she can't leave me alone
And I can't wait to see how low she can go
I love how it look but is it good
I can tell she like me cause she dropped it and said
Baby it's goo-oo-oo-oo-ood, goo-oo-oo-oo-ood
Goo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ood
Goo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ood
I love how it look but is it good
Good, good, good

[Verse 2: Brianna Perry]
Miss Goody Two Shoes
Bad heels
Got that yummy, hot meals
I Kill Bill, who got bills?
You push Hot Wheels
With the ice grills
He from the hood
So he pop the hood
If a dude ever wanna take it out the club
Security come with the "Back It Up"
But I'm pushing on him like a Tonka truck
Treat me good but I'm acting up
Cause I'm better than the smell of a garbage truck
Fuck you, don't ask why
Money falling out the sky like it multiplied
Maybe the sky is falling
Maybe the Dow is falling
Gimme his check, gimme respect
He ain't going nowhere
But a nigga won't bet

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I know she can't leave me alone
And I can't wait to see how low she can go
I love how it look but is it good
I can tell she like me cause she dropped it and said
Baby it's goo-oo-oo-oo-ood, goo-oo-oo-oo-ood
Goo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ood
Goo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ood
I love how it look but is it good
Good, good, good

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
Look so good
Wish I could
Baby just relax if you want it then you got a wish on my wood
It's good, so good, it's good
I can tell she like it when I pipe it she say

[Chrous: Trey Songz]
I know she can't leave me alone
And I can't wait to see how low she can go
I love how it look but is it good
I can tell she like me cause she dropped it and said
Baby it's goo-oo-oo-oo-ood, goo-oo-oo-oo-ood
Goo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ood
Goo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ood
I love how it look but is it good
Good, good, good
