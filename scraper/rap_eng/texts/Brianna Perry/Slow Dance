[Intro: Brianna Perry]
Run it up, slow down
Run it up, slow down
Run it up, slow down
Run it up, slow down

[Chorus: Brianna Perry]
Ooh, hoes be hating, yeah
I just slow dance with money
In a romance with the money
In a real trance with the money
While these hoes be hating, yeah
I just be counting a hundred
Really be counting a hundred
Young bitch, I came up from nothing
While these hoes be hating, yeah
I just slow dance with money
In a romance with the money
In a real trance with the money
While these hoes be hating, yeah
I just be counting a hundred
Really be counting a hundred

[Verse 1: Brianna Perry]
Young bitch, I came up from nothing
Way, way down at the bottom
Now I just slow dance with the money
Every red bottom, I got 'em
Used to be hungry for days
Now I got steak on my plate
So wavy, just look at the wave
So wavy, just look at the wave
Yeah I pull up in the Benz
I got that heat on my plate
Killin' this shit, DOA
Killin' this shit, DOA
Coroner, bitch, coroner
Yeah, look at us shinin'
I just copped me the Patek
I call that perfect timing
Look at these perfect diamonds, yeah, I just do it
BlocBoy on my side, and he is a shooter
When we step out, paparazzi wan' shoot us
20/20 vision, drip on these niggas, jacuzzi

[Chorus: Brianna Perry]
Ooh, hoes be hating, yeah
I just slow dance with money
In a romance with the money
In a real trance with the money
While these hoes be hating, yeah
I just be counting a hundred
Really be counting a hundred
Young bitch, I came up from nothing
While these hoes be hating, yeah
I just slow dance with money
In a romance with the money
In a real trance with the money
While these hoes be hating, yeah
I just be counting a hundred
Really be counting a hundred

[Verse 2: BlocBoy JB]
I'ma count up me a check, nothin' less (Nothin' less)
I just spent three bands at Louis V, I must confess (Word)
Jugg and finesse, her ass I caress (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
If her boyfriend got a problem, I shoot above the chest (Rrah)
Thatâ€™s a headshot, no Flintstone, bedrock (Bedrock)
Witnesses say they heard four shots, then his head dropped (His head dropped)
I just bought 'bout five Glocks from the pawn shop (That's on my mama)
Yeah my niggas down, we eat you, like they do lunch stops (lunch stops)
Before I cut some grass, I'ma cut a check, yeah (Cut a check)
Before I touch her ass, gotta get some neck, yeah (Get some neck)
Get my green like Shrek, yeah, serving all the crackheads (Crackheads)
Make his brains hit the skillet like a cracked egg (Rrah, baow)

[Chorus: Brianna Perry]
Ooh, hoes be hating, yeah
I just slow dance with money
In a romance with the money
In a real trance with the money
While these hoes be hating, yeah
I just be counting a hundred
Really be counting a hundred
Young bitch, I came up from nothing
While these hoes be hating, yeah
I just slow dance with money
In a romance with the money
In a real trance with the money
While these hoes be hating, yeah
I just be counting a hundred
Really be counting a hundred
