[Verse 1]
Ridin' down Crenshaw and Rosecrans
Caviar lookin' like toejam
Traded the McLaren for a wedding band
Ride still drippin', that's an avalanche
Writin' love songs, on my shit again
Billie Holliday with the piano man
Talkin' to the Balmain veteran
At the White House, buckin' like let us in, let us in
Sprinkle a little truth, heard the lies in
Clive Davis party, let mom in
Same hotel Whitney died in
Feel like the room let God in
Still talkin' out my heart, love sayin' though
Boy, paint a picture, yeah, Van Gough
Treat the Saint Regis like a bando
Rose petals on the floor, purple candles
On the PJ in my PJ's, out the PJ's
These days I'm in Priv√© with the PA
Need bae, snuck the forty-forty in the club
Still talkin' dirty money, left a ring around the tub, let it marinate
Yeah, let it marinate

[Chorus]
Strange fruit hangin' from a rope, take note
Out here movin' units like dope, take note
I been on my diva shit, Anita Baker
I been gettin' so much bread, I need a baker
I need a baker
Yeah, I need a baker, yeah
Stars on the roof, pledge allegiance
Bellhopper tryna buy a freed
Ever go broke, God let it be
Made money but you can't buy a legacy

[Verse 2]
Young bitch, but I'm so old school
Move the work like I do Pro Tools
Bow your head when you listen, this soul food
I had the H2O since '02
Bitch, I been flew, I'm a movie, hit info
Came a long way from the Pinto
Now I do the pent' floor, and the view is amazin'
Old hoes better go and turn into raisans
Pray for 'em
In the glam and I slay for 'em
I'm the Lauryn Hill in a new form
Greatest story never told, pray I make it though
They be prayin' shit fold, but you should talk to God 'bout somethin' better
Lactose but I'm still gettin' to the cheddar
Ten degrees in the winter but he still sweat her
Caught up in the rapture
Glad my daddy stuck around or I would've been a bastard
And my mama get a Porsche
It would've been some hard times if she got that abortion
Off the porch, now I think about a Porsche
Call me Ms. Perry and Ms. Parker
Had the brains, but not money for Harvard
I don't know a doctor
I don't know nobody who went to an opera
I just learned how to cut, stay proper

[Chorus]
Strange fruit hangin' from a rope, take note
Out here movin' units like dope, take note
I been on my diva shit, Anita Baker
I been gettin' so much bread, I need a baker
I need a baker
Yeah, I need a baker, yeah
Stars on the roof, pledge allegiance
Bellhopper tryna buy a freed
Ever go broke, God let it be
Made money but you can't buy a legacy
