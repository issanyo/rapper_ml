[Intro]
Gotta be nice for what to these bitches?
Yeah, haha
BP, yee
30, you a fool for this one

[Verse]
Bulletproof the windshield, the doors, and the locks
Bloodstains on the carpet probably from poppin' at opps
Played the corner like Deion, primetime in the box
From Dade County, might breeze through the locks, I’m from the block
Name a rap bitch with this kind of flow, oh, I'm the last dragon
Bruce Leroy with the glow, pardon my braggin'
I’m backin' out in the Aston with the MEA on my ass
And I'm laughin' at all these bitches who told me I couldn't pass 'em
Room, bitch, get his as the moon, bitch
Marry a bad boy and get rid of that loon, bitch
Elephant in the room, bitch, it ain't no more room, bitch
And if I ain't top five, my day comin’ soon, bitch
Kick open the bank door when I make a deposit
I got it bustin’ out the trash bag but this ain't no garbage
Don’t carry wallets, I'm cocky
But yet I'm modest
The coolest, but I'm the hottest
You foolish, thinkin’ I'm losin'
I'm smoother than shoe polish
Demolishin' opposition, ho, pay attention and listen
I'ma see the Ricky Rozay and Beyonce
The mission to get the bag and get missin'
Got bigger bags in my vision
I started without a dime and I grind my way to your vision, I saw it
Smoke it out like I'm Marley
Party hard when I party
Like Mardi Gras, I'm the hardest
My plate hearty, they starvin'
I made it out of that bullshit I was in
Hate I bullshitted them but that bullshit in the wind
And these niggas lyin' on they dick for attention, or a mention
How 'bout you leave all that shit that them bitches do to the bitches
Bitch nigga, pop up with that stick, nigga
Unlock like a pick, nigga, I'm built for this shit, nigga
You built like a bitch, nigga, you can't have a dick, nigga
You probably wear panties, I pop shots at your granny
Then catch a flight to the Grammys
You more Sammy than Sosa, you probably sleep on a sofa
You broke bum ass nigga, bread crumb ass nigga
The Patek iced out, lights out
Tryna ride this wave gon' get you drowned, nigga, right now
Surfin' on my page gon' get you found like I Googled you
Drums on all these sticks but I might show you what that Ruger do, hula hoop
Money Team, never lose, Floyd May'
Might pull out that Wraith and get to chillin' bitches, broad day
All they got to say is how my attitude and titties fake
Fuck them bitches, let 'em hate
I don't fuck with them anyway
Pussy ass
