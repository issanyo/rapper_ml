[Intro]
Haha
You know what to do when you see a rich bitch
Cheeze

[Chorus]
305 in the building, cop a Wraith, no ceiling
It's a hell of a feeling, got a hell of a check
Bitch, I'm drippin' in Fendi, know these bitches offended
Stay the fuck out my mentions, get the fuck off my dick, bitch
Richer than rich, bitch
Walk light in them Christians, bitch
Pop shit like missiles, bitch
ASAP, motherfuckin' realest
Fifty racks in the pack
Blue cheese, no ranch, I'm fresh like salad
Swimmin' in carats, big rock, lookin' like I'm married
New drop, come through with your daddy

[Verse 1]
I am fashion, put me in a casket
Killin' these bitches, fuckin' up traffic
That's your nigga, better catch him 'fore I bless him
I ain't goin' back and forth, bitch, you messy
Got a Coke bottle shape, bitch, I look like a Pepsi
Hop out that Phantom, put that ratchet on you, bestie
I'm in Atlanta, up in Magic on a jet-ski
I'm havin' water, I'll drown me a bitch
Dropped a check on that new coupe, I'ma piss these bitches off
Play with me, bitch, I'll take your nigga, let him hit it raw
I'm up in Saks fuckin' up a sack, two tone on the back
I'm a meal, you a fuckin' snack, South Beach with them racks

[Chorus]
305 in the building, cop a Wraith, no ceiling
It's a hell of a feeling, got a hell of a check
Bitch, I'm drippin' in Fendi, know these bitches offended
Stay the fuck out my mentions, get the fuck off my dick, bitch
Richer than rich, bitch
Walk light in them Christians, bitch
Pop shit like missiles, bitch
ASAP, motherfuckin' realest
Fifty racks in the pack
Blue cheese, no ranch, I'm fresh like salad
Swimmin' in carats, big rock, lookin' like I'm married
New drop, come through with your daddy

[Verse 2]
Dade County got it jumpin' like the lunch line
Got your nigga eatin' pussy like it's lunch time
Bitch, move, coochie wet like a Jacuzzi
VVS in my Cuban, it's a one-of-one, Frank Mueller
Cape Town, Ocean Drive, red bottoms, that's how cake walk
His and her Benz, Cartier lens, me and my friend, kick it like men
Come through drippin', spent 'bout a ten
All gold bottles, I don't do tin
Broke lil' bitch better go'n with the wind, yeah
I don't really do the back and forth
Louis top, Balmain shorts
Buyin' 'em, fuck 'em, feed 'em, leave 'em
Kick 'em out, no remorse
Thousand horse on the Porsche
I got a thousand bitches of course
You want my name, bitch, Bri
You know where I'm from, you know where I be

[Chorus]
305 in the building, cop a Wraith, no ceiling
It's a hell of a feeling, got a hell of a check
Bitch, I'm drippin' in Fendi, know these bitches offended
Stay the fuck out my mentions, get the fuck off my dick, bitch
Richer than rich, bitch
Walk light in them Christians, bitch
Pop shit like missiles, bitch
ASAP, motherfuckin' realest
Fifty racks in the pack
Blue cheese, no ranch, I'm fresh like salad
Swimmin' in carats, big rock, lookin' like I'm married
New drop, come through with your daddy
