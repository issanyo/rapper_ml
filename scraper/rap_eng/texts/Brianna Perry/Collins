[Intro: Brianna Perry]
This drip right here
Dumb ass hoes
BP (BP), yeah
Cheese
Yeah

[Chorus: Hood Brat]
Cruisin' down Collins in my two-door (Skrrt)
Point at these bitches (Hey), laugh at these hoes
On your nigga's mind like a new snapback
If you try me, lil' bitch, then I'm gon' clap back
All that talkin', what you sayin', ho? Bitch, don't play with me
Ain't no talkin', we just sprayin', ho, bitch, don't play with me
All that talkin', what you sayin', ho? Bitch, don't play with me
Ain't no talkin', we just sprayin', ho, bitch, don't play with me

[Verse 1: Brianna Perry]
Yeah, buddy want me to come over
Send a deposit, promoter
Diamonds is crazy, bipolar
Pink cup like strawberry soda
Call up the plug, he say, "Hola"
He give me one million dollar
He want that pussy in water
Sick of these niggas, he baller, no lie
Somethin' that you might not know 'bout
'bitch, I grew up in the dopehouse
I don't pull the dope out
Last nigga left me with a broke heart
Why you hustle more, called
Fuck boy, callate la boca
Damn, just came down off a plan
Back kinda hurt so I'm prayin'
Stuntin' all night, Jackie Chan
Gucci fanny pack, European, full of bands
Full of bands, full of bands, goddamn

[Chorus: Hood Brat]
Cruisin' down Collins in my two-door (Skrrt)
Point at these bitches (Hey), laugh at these hoes
On your nigga's mind like a new snapback
If you try me, lil' bitch, then I'm gon' clap back
All that talkin', what you sayin', ho? Bitch, don't play with me
Ain't no talkin', we just sprayin', ho, bitch, don't play with me
All that talkin', what you sayin', ho? Bitch, don't play with me
Ain't no talkin', we just sprayin', ho, bitch, don't play with me

[Verse 2: Brianna Perry]
Me and Paula Dean watchin' Roots, ooh
Let your nigga feed me fruits, ooh
Screech in a droptop coupe, ooh
Had to Casey Anthony the roof, ooh
Bitch, you ain't wearin' nothin' new, ooh
Stayed to my feet like a zoo, ooh
Bein' broke ain't no excuse, ooh
Name of the Lord, I rebuke you
Yes, I'm a real one, you a civillian
After the line-up, run out the pavillion
Look at they face when I step in the building
Bitches collapse and I'm on Wendy Williams, ooh
I'm talkin' millions
At the flea market with my ghetto children
Hit South Beach with the 'Gatti on E
I don't give a fuck what they say about me, I'm cruisin'

[Chorus: Hood Brat]
Cruisin' down Collins in my two-door (Skrrt)
Point at these bitches (Hey), laugh at these hoes
On your nigga's mind like a new snapback
If you try me, lil' bitch, then I'm gon' clap back
All that talkin', what you sayin', ho? Bitch, don't play with me
Ain't no talkin', we just sprayin', ho, bitch, don't play with me
All that talkin', what you sayin', ho? Bitch, don't play with me
Ain't no talkin', we just sprayin', ho, bitch, don't play with me
