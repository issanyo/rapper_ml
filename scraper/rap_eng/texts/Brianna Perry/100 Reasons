[Intro]
Brianna
Hundred

[Chorus]
Hundred reasons they should free Meek (yeah)
Hundred reasons they should free Scope
Might as well let Meech go
Strut out here for these bad hoes
Wipe your nose, wipe your nose, wipe your nose
Hundred reasons they should free Meek (yeah)
Hundred reasons they should free Scope
Might as well let Meech go
Strut out here for these bad hoes
Wipe your nose, wipe your nose

[Verse 1]
Hopped in the shower, shit on my mind
Sick of these fuck niggas callin' my line
Rozay got me readin' the ghetto Qur'an
Loretta Devine, I'm better with time
Heard 'bout the photos from baller alert
Covered in coco and lit like a perc
Two of my dogs in the county on murder
They didn't deserve it, I cried at the verdict like no
Fresh out the feds (yeah yeah)
Fuck up the bread (uh-huh)
She's in a Wraith (yee)
[?] in Hermes (um-hmm)
Open the safe with a keypad
Still at the table with E class
Print so long I didn't need pads
Saint Laurent heels and a ski mask
Lame niggas fuckin' up the game
Y'all give the trap a bad name
Doin' a hundred down Biscayne
High as hell, I feel like Rick James
Tell your co-defendant good riddance
Know it's bad when the plug start snitchin'
Same fools up in the club with you
From the mud with you, give a dub to you, that's crazy

[Chorus]
Hundred reasons they should free Meek (yeah)
Hundred reasons they should free Scope
Might as well let Meech go
Strut out here for these bad hoes
Wipe your nose, wipe your nose, wipe your nose
Hundred reasons they should free Meek (yeah)
Hundred reasons they should free Scope
Might as well let Meech go
Strut out here for these bad hoes
Wipe your nose, wipe your nose

[Verse 2]
Hundred whips, a hundred chains
Hundred politicians playing a hundred games
Man, but understand where I come from
I don't fuck with these flaw rappers
I'm a twelve gauge, what's a Lil Pump?
Fresh off the porch, I was eager to ball
Still got a poster of Meech on the wall
Brisco and Boobie, I'm speakin' for y'all
Got E on a call, like free all my dogs, whoa
Stay patient, motivation
So many niggas fightin' time, sendin' 'em affadavits
Courtroom full of old cases, ain't no tellin' what the boy facin'
Crackers out here lettin' go rapists
But you givin' time for missin' probation
Hundred reasons I could blame y'all
Hundred reasons they should change laws
Hundred reasons they supporting revolutionaries out here tryna stand tall
Heard my dog just got a date
We outside waiting at the gate
Pull up back to back in the Wraiths
Straight to KOD to blow the bank
And the roof on George Jackson
After Trump, I don't do election
In the mall, finna burn it all
Like yeah bitch, still BMF-ing, let's go

[Chorus]
Hundred reasons they should free Meek (yeah)
Hundred reasons they should free Scope
Might as well let Meech go
Strut out here for these bad hoes
Wipe your nose, wipe your nose, wipe your nose
Hundred reasons they should free Meek (yeah)
Hundred reasons they should free Scope
Might as well let Meech go
Strut out here for these bad hoes
Wipe your nose, wipe your nose
