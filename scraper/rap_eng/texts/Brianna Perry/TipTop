[Intro]
Let the BandPlay
CeeO (Street)
Brianna

[Chorus]
Wrist offset, real wet, drip drop, yeah (Yeah)
Givenchy, get off me, stay tip top, yeah (Yeah)
At Saks Fifth, don't got shit your bitch got, yeah (Yeah)
That big bag, no old money, don't hit clocks, yeah (Yeah)
Your nigga salty, I grabbed the check and I dipped off
His face all in it, his lips is drippin', no lip gloss
These Saint Laurent, bitch, you still be coppin' them flip-flops
My wrist is drippin', I'm flooded, bitch, it don't tick-tock

[Verse 1]
Got a main nigga, got a side nigga, and they both think I'm committed
Louis Vuitton wrapped around my arm, probably cost enough to feed a village
Been paid, talkin' lemonade, 'cause the 'frigerator full of lemons
You an intern, let the fish burn, lil' bitty bitch, mind your business, let go
Big shot, Ben Simmons
Pirates with me, Captain Phillips
Dirt bikes and four wheelers
Credit cards and dope dealers
Don't care 'bout no how you refer to me
I know you hoes wanna murder me
Chanel on my panties, the nerve of me
I'm lookin' fresh out of surgery
Poor guy, war ID, clear, no fair, cutthroat
Got a GloBoy, oh boy, poor boy, runnin' shit like Death Row
They got me right where I'm 'posed to be
My niggas never say no to me, ooh
I make 'em sing for it, Jodeci, ooh
We got it straight out the pork and beans, ooh

[Chorus]
Wrist offset, real wet, drip drop, yeah (Yeah)
Givenchy, get off me, stay tip top, yeah (Yeah)
At Saks Fifth, don't got shit your bitch got, yeah (Yeah)
That big bag, no old money, don't hit clocks, yeah (Yeah)
Your nigga salty, I grabbed the check and I dipped off
His face all in it, his lips is drippin', no lip gloss
These Saint Laurent, bitch, you still be coppin' them flip-flops
My wrist is drippin', I'm flooded, bitch, it don't tick-tock

[Verse 2]
Twinkle twinkle with my little star, but these nursery rhymes get big checks
I'm a big deal, that's a big fact, ex still cryin' when his bitch
See mama gave me good DNA, so niggas want my TNA
I got a hood nigga from round the way
We on the run, but no B and J
He ate the cookie for a whole hour while I watched Power, then I got ghost
Went home, took a cold shower, now I'm out trippin' in new 'drobe, ooh
Fendi on, it's a mood, G5 to the Louvre
Balenciagas on me, smellin' like Chanel and OG
If I got a bill and he don't assist, then he don't exist
Cut me a check, bet, 'fore I cut you off, Gillette, next
Rookie, don't play with a vet, wet, VVS all on my neck
I got rank, I just left your baby daddy, now I'm headed to the bank, Ben Frank, yeah

[Chorus]
Wrist offset, real wet, drip drop, yeah (Yeah)
Givenchy, get off me, stay tip top, yeah (Yeah)
At Saks Fifth, don't got shit your bitch got, yeah (Yeah)
That big bag, no old money, don't hit clocks, yeah (Yeah)
Your nigga salty, I grabbed the check and I dipped off
His face all in it, his lips is drippin', no lip gloss
These Saint Laurent, bitch, you still be coppin' them flip-flops
My wrist is drippin', I'm flooded, bitch, it don't tick-tock
