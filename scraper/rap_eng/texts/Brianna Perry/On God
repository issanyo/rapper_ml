[Intro]
Yeah yeah
BP
On God
Ayy, I prayed for this, man

[Chorus]
650 Benz in the back, yeah, on God
Burnin' through the bands, nigga, that part, on God
Richard Mille, clear face, new shit, put that on God
Party right here, nigga, blue strip, that on God
Got the pot jumpin', jumpin', jumpin', jumpin'
Jumpin', jumpin', Kyrie with the pot, bitch
Jumpin', jumpin', jumpin', jumpin'
You ain't gotta wait, you can hate right now
Blow a whole bag in your face right now

[Verse 1]
Catfish money, need a printer
Couple shooters with me in a Sprinter
Chanel or CÃ©line my dilemma
Fuck a nigga, on my Kylie Jenner
Bustin' 12 o'clocks on the back street
Runnin' through the paper like at track meet
And a black puppy in the backseat
Might give the pussy to an athlete
Please don't offend me, beef turn to envy
Never had nothin' I blew 'fore this Bentley
So do not tempt me, brand new Givenchy
Bust on his face like Monica Lewinsky, woo
Dukes of Hazzard, hoppin' out the coupe
Nasty as I wanna be, I feel like Uncle Luke
Surf in my pool, bitch, pay your dues
Fuck up your red carpet in these Jimmy Choos

[Chorus]
650 Benz in the back, yeah, on God
Burnin' through the bands, nigga, that part, on God
Richard Mille, clear face, new shit, put that on God
Party right here, nigga, blue strip, that on God
Got the pot jumpin', jumpin', jumpin', jumpin'
Jumpin', jumpin', Kyrie with the pot, bitch
Jumpin', jumpin', jumpin', jumpin'
You ain't gotta wait, you can hate right now
Blow a whole bag in your face right now

[Verse 2]
Swagger Viagra, go hard on these niggas
Run through your paper like I'm Robin Givens
Told you get money but you hoes don't listen
AMBER Alert 'cause my roof came up missin'
Cookin' that work, me no play in the kitchen
Lookin' like I'm Rachel Ray in that kitchen
Never let broke hoes fuck up your position
I had to learn that from Khloe and Tristan
Likes in my DM out to Cabo
Head game got him suicidal, ayy
Black and white Lambo, gelato, ayy
Gucci prints all on my Bible, ayy
Fuck up your mood, step on the blues
Dance with the money like I'm Victor Cruz
Cup spilleth over with the D'usse, ayy
In the Rolls-Royce spillin' Kool-Aid, ayy

[Chorus]
650 Benz in the back, yeah, on God
Burnin' through the bands, nigga, that part, on God
Richard Mille, clear face, new shit, put that on God
Party right here, nigga, blue strip, that on God
Got the pot jumpin', jumpin', jumpin', jumpin'
Jumpin', jumpin', Kyrie with the pot, bitch
Jumpin', jumpin', jumpin', jumpin'
You ain't gotta wait, you can hate right now
Blow a whole bag in your face right now
