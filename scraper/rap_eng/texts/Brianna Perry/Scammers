[Chorus: Gunna]
Wanna fuck hoes, I can do the same thing
I'ma bust down the Rollie, I can’t rock the plain jane
Wanna fuck hoes, I can do the same thing
I'ma bust down the Rollie, I can't rock the plain jane
I get money and I still fuck with scammers
I get money and I still fuck with scammers
I get money and I still fuck with scammers
So much money, bitch, I might buy a bando

[Verse 1: Brianna Perry & Gunna]
Wanna fuck hoes, I can do the same thing
I might do the bustdown, I might do the plain jane
When I make it rain, boy, it make my panties rain
If they hatin’ on us, fuck 'em all, run the train
Swipe for the Balmain (Swipe for the Balmain)
Swipe for the Balmain (Swipe for the Balmain)
Swipe for the Dolce (Swipe for the Dolce)
Swipe for the Dolce (Swipe for the Dolce)
I be in and out boutiques, say my stylist so unique
He say I look like a freak, I'm in Gucci every week
I wear Louis every Sunday just to hear my pastor preachin'
Fendi prints on me just so I can spot a leach
Just met with the plug, now you gone off the drugs
Now you gone off the drugs and the streets show me love, 'cause

[Chorus: Gunna]
I get money and I still fuck with scammers
I get money and I still fuck with scammers
I get money and I still fuck with scammers
So much money, bitch, I might buy a bando
I get money and I still fuck with scammers
I get money and I still fuck with scammers
I get money and I still fuck with scammers
So much money, bitch, I might buy a bando

[Verse 2: YM Babie]
All the D-boys really like me but the scammers tryna wife me
Fly me out and take me shopping, guess this piece is really poppin'
This Céline bag cost five bands, no you can't cop at Hot Topic
And my Cuban link on freeze, like my jeweler Baskin-Robbins
His old hoes don't compare to me, he know bad bitches ain’t cheap
I’m in Saks like every week
I like the bag, get paid a fee (Swipe)
Paid in full, no fuckin' lease
These LV on my fuckin’ feet (Period)
He blowin' bags on a real bitch
New condo out on South Beach
Hold up, I got money, might steal Swizzy for a bando
Bustdown on my wrist make my hand glow
Gave me the black card, that pussy got him whipped (Goofy)
Only thing these bitches wrappin' is a fuckin' gift (YM)

[Chorus: Gunna]
I get money and I still fuck with scammers
I get money and I still fuck with scammers
I get money and I still fuck with scammers
So much money, bitch, I might buy a bando
I get money and I still fuck with scammers
I get money and I still fuck with scammers
I get money and I still fuck with scammers
So much money, bitch, I might buy a bando
