[Chorus]
It seem like every time I try to tell you somethin'
You try to flip it into somethin' else
It seem like every time I try to tell you somethin'
You try to flip it into somethin' else
Ooh, you love to flip it
Ooh, you love to flip it
Ooh, you love to flip it
Ooh, you love to flip it
You love to flip it, you love to flip it
You love to flip it, you love to flip it
You love to flip it, you love to flip it
You love to flip it, you love to flip it

[Verse 1: Brianna Perry]
Niggas got emotions like a bitch
Ooh, no I can't fuck with no bitch
That moody, it go triple, shit wet
So how I'm comin' back, boy, that dick crack
Paragraphs in my phone, write a book or somethin'
All that time on your hands, cop a Rollie or somethin'
Why you standin' in my face like I owe you somethin'
All that talkin' with your hands, I'ma show you somethin'
You got some good head but some bad vibes
Need a break from all the games, nigga, halftime
You tryna find my location, I think we need a vacation
Feel like I'm losing my patience, call it a fightin' temptation
Now watch how you flip it

[Chorus]
It seem like every time I try to tell you somethin'
You try to flip it into somethin' else
It seem like every time I try to tell you somethin'
You try to flip it into somethin' else
Ooh, you love to flip it
Ooh, you love to flip it
Ooh, you love to flip it
Ooh, you love to flip it
You love to flip it, you love to flip it
You love to flip it, you love to flip it
You love to flip it, you love to flip it
You love to flip it, you love to flip it

[Verse 2: Brianna Perry]
Ooh, hate an immature nigga
It's already insecure niggas
Kanye, sick in the head, need a cure nigga
You just lost the baddest bitch, shed a tear, nigga
I caught you fuckin' the bitch, you know I'm done with this shit
I let you run with the shit, just to keep under my shit
I'm havin' fun with this shit, pussy all under your lip
Beggin' to stick in the tip, I tell him to stick to the script
I need Balmains, you bought me Levis
I'm used to Prime 112, you bought me french fry
You're on a decline, and on my free time
Hold up, let's rewind, I need some me time
Now watch how I flip it

[Chorus]
It seem like every time I try to tell you somethin'
You try to flip it into somethin' else
It seem like every time I try to tell you somethin'
You try to flip it into somethin' else
Ooh, you love to flip it
Ooh, you love to flip it
Ooh, you love to flip it
Ooh, you love to flip it
You love to flip it, you love to flip it
You love to flip it, you love to flip it
You love to flip it, you love to flip it
You love to flip it, you love to flip it
