[Intro: Brianna Perry]
Dope man, wanna be the dope man (Yeah yeah)
Dope man, wanna be the dope man (Perry)
Wanna be the dope man
Wanna be the dope man

[Verse 1: Brianna Perry]
Damn that dope look stepped on
Got a side nigga I crept on
With a pink little Jeep like Pepto
With a sick little drip like strep throat
Highlight with a little green on it
Lil' pump with a little beam on it
Gucci gang, make a nigga sing on it
Queen B, got a lil’ sting on it
Freeze up, lil' bitch too cool
Graduated but I used to skip school
Got a piston with a pistol
With to shoot that any time the rent due, yeah yeah
I seen things, I don't tell
Buy bands for the YSL
Funny lil’ nigga, SNL
Out in Paris coppin' shit I can't sleep (What's that?)

[Chorus: Brianna Perry]
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Flaw nigga, you trap
Cryin' 'bout a ho, that's cap
Bro keep a cup full of Act'
Finna put a beam on the map, stat
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Ride for the team, all black
Fake Margiela, that’s cap
In the trap, finna take a nap
Flaw ass nigga, you cap

[Verse 2: Lee Mazin]
Loubs with the Louis, that’s drippin'
Blood on the bottom, that’s sticky
Step in battle like 'Seppe
I don't like broke niggas, bitch, I'm picky
Lil’ deuce-deuce in my bag
Yeah, I gotta do somethin' bad
It's a lil' boss ass bitch out eatin'
And I'm at the BP, hustle with BP, skrrt
He the a dope boy like Meechy
And my at, stick my ass up, don't freeze me
All in the kitchen, he whippin' the pot
Fuckin' that bitch up then hittin' the block (Skrrt)
Stay in your lane like Tory
If you get grabbed, don't tell no stories
Bet you can't find my ass like Dory
'Cause I'm on the block with my dope boys

[Chorus: Brianna Perry]
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Flaw nigga, you trap
Cryin' 'bout a ho, that's cap
Bro keep a cup full of Act'
Finna put a beam on the map, stat
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Ride for the team, all black
Fake Margiela, that's cap
In the trap, finna take a nap
Flaw ass nigga, you cap

[Verse 3: Brianna Perry]
Got a white bitch, that OJ
Diamonds dancin' on me, that Soul Train
Suicide door, that Cobain
'Bout to make a movie, that Kim K
Platinum Rollie handcrafted
Cut a pill, it's Xan-tastic
Pull up in the same Aston
Pin off, no trackin'
All flashy, fantastic, woo
Straight from the bottom, pocket full of moo'
Too much of the jewels, pray for the blue
See your red bottom, we take 'me and blew
You don't wanna take aride in my trunk
I got a Zoe, mouth full of golds
At the Four Seasons, we meet up in O
Forty got his pants saggin'
Niggas on my bandwagon
Boss bitch, no cappin'

[Chorus: Brianna Perry]
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Flaw nigga, you trap
Cryin' 'bout a ho, that's cap
Bro keep a cup full of Act'
Finna put a beam on the map, stat
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Everybody wanna be the dope man
Ride for the team, all black
Fake Margiela, that's cap
In the trap, finna take a nap
Flaw ass nigga, you cap
