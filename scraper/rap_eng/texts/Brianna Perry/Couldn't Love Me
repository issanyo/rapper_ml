[Intro]
Yeah, Brianna
Sometimes it's so complicated, you know
It’s just complicated

[Chorus]
He couldn't love me, though he liked me a lot
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn’t love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Nigga couldn't love me, though he liked me a lot
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me

[Verse 1]
That nigga couldn't love me, though he liked me a lot
He kept runnin' back and had to check for the block
Had to check for his boys and send a check for his boys
And slide through his mama crib and his dunk makin’ noise
And I, I would wait for him, up late for him
Save a plate for him, even pray for him, wanna change for him
But, see all he brought me was change
Yeah I fucked another nigga but had him on my brain
’Cause I fell for him, but he couldn't love me the same
Gucci, Balenciaga, had me drippin’ in game
He in these streets and he sneakin' with these freaks
So what make it so bad, when they see me, they ain't gon' speak
He just a raw nigga so these hoes want a piece
When he get a bustdown Cuban link every week
Muddy water and it stank, so I know he can’t think straight
Wanna slow down but he tell me that he can't, bae
We don't do dates
And I know he stressin', thinkin' 'bout his court dates
And if them crackers get him, I'ma bill his JPay
'Cause I'm just that bitch
And though I love him, man, he still ain't shit
I'm tryna tell you, though

[Chorus]
He couldn't love me, though he liked me a lot
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Nigga couldn't love me, though he liked me a lot
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me

[Verse 2]
You had this bitch in your crib takin' pictures and videos?
I'm layin' next to you, actin' like I ain't even know
I'm lookin' at the door sayin' damn, I should really go
I knew he was a dog, but I ain't think he would go so low
I still love his kids like they mine, though
And he be tryin' me, must think I'm a blind ho
And he say, "You gon' leave me for these lyin' hoes?
You my lil' baby, I don't see 'em like a blindfold
You the only one I spend on and switch timezones"
I caught him cheatin' and he bought my ass a condo
And I ain't even sayin' that on no fly shit
'Cause every night I'm in this bitch on some cryin' shit
On some tired of tryin' shit
On some I could be back at my mama's shit
I know you need me but you sleazy
Put my sweats on and my Yeezys, playin' cheesy
It ain't easy, but I gotta go

[Chorus]
He couldn't love me, though he liked me a lot
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Nigga couldn't love me, though he liked me a lot
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me

[Verse 3]
But I forgive him 'cause he one in a million
The way we look in them pictures is the way we walk in them buildings
I got some loving to give him, might just text him I miss him
It was some lies on his lips but I'm still finna kiss 'em
'Cause he mine, though
And no matter how it look, I know he tryin', though
And yeah, he a bad boy, but that's my kind, though
Yeah I love him and I like him a lot
Us forever, that's the twist to the plot
We on the way to the top

[Chorus]
He couldn't love me, though he liked me a lot
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Nigga couldn't love me, though he liked me a lot
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me

[Outro]
He couldn't love me, though he liked me a lot
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Nigga couldn't love me, though he liked me a lot
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
Though he liked me a lot, he couldn't love me
