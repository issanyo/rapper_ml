[Intro: T-Pain]
Hey, Yung Joc, T-Pain, Nappy Boy!
Ohh ahh, put you on a mollie, girl

[Hook: Yung Joc]
(Girl) put this on your tongue, let me show you how this
(girl) put this on your tongue, let me show you how this
(girl) put this on your tongue, let me show you how this
(girl) put this on your tongue, let me show you how this mollie work (look out for this mollie)
How this mollie work, how this mollie work
How this mollie work, how this mollie work
How this mollie work, how this mollie work
Put this on your tongue, let me show you how this mollie work

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
Ladi ladi, we came to party
Roll up the loud, who got the molly?
Lot of bad bitches, serve still the cop
Some balling on the budget but them bottles still popping (still popping)
I've got a fistful of dollars
She left her lipstick on my collar
Let me introduce you to the mollie
Have a lip service in my Audi

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yung Joc]
Girls, girls I do adore
One more due, I need three or four
Is just you, me and mollie, on my floor
Now your panties dropping on my floor
On the floor, floor, baby you're the one
Transform, form, when you put this on your tongue
Don't run, run, drop it on the one
I'm like yum, yum, girl your sweets is bubble yum
You make the girls dutty wine, dance like no spine
The mollie make me want to join in from behind
The girls dutty wine, dance like no spine
Mollie make me want to bu-bu-bump and grind

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
I got a girl that I've planning love with
She always got me ready for that club shit
She got me giggling and watching these booties wiggling, jiggling
And I'mma hit it and split it
And if you with it I'm with it, oh!
I think I bring a smile coming on
I can run a hundred miles from a hundred bones
You wanna see me do it first
Had to pop a Mollie just so I could do this verse
Put this on your tongue baby you gonna feel horny
Put this on your tongue baby you gonna feel horny
You ain’t never had it, baby I’ma bless you right
Have your chain going left and right and right and left and right

[Bridge: Yung Joc]
Girl, you're the life for this party
I say you're the life for this party (the life for this party)
You're the life for this party
I say you're the life for this party
And I don't care what nobody say
You're the baddest motherfucker in here (I swear, oh yeah)
And I don't care what nobody say
You're the baddest motherfucker in here (I swear, I swear)

[Hook]

[Outro: T-Pain]
She's got an opening there that keeps her cold
She's not able to keep her clothes
