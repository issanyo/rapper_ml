It's tearing me apart every time I realize
What we used to have is finished
And what I wouldn't give to rewind the past

I'm tired of walking around with my head
Hanging down, beating myself up about it
Gotta make my mind up before it's too late

I can't blame you
After all the shit I put you through
Even gonna lie to you
I've got some issues

I must admit that I was wrong
I've got some issues
Didn't know what I had 'til it was gone
And I don't know if I deserve

For you to come back home
'Cause I got issues
Girl, I got issues
Don't hold it against me

And I just can't walk away
(Just can't walk away)
'Cause my life is faded
(Faded)
I'm trapped in 2 different worlds without you

I've been tracing my footsteps
But keep going in circles
And you say your done with me
Girl, I can't try

I can't blame you
After all the shit I put you through
Not even gonna lie to you
I've got some issues

I must admit that I was wrong
I've got some issues
Didn't know what I had 'til it was gone
And I don't know if I deserve

For you to come back home
'Cause I got issues
Girl, I got issues
Don't hold it against me

In spite of my own issues
At least I'm man enough to tell y'all
You can't nudge me for being honest
(No)
I see you acting like you wanna leave
But don't turn your back on me

I've got some issues
I must admit that I was wrong
I've got some issues
Didn't know what I had 'til it was gone

And I don't know if I deserve
For you to come back home
'Cause I got issues
Girl, I got issues

It's tearing me apart every time I realize
What we used to have is finished
And what I wouldn't give to rewind the past
