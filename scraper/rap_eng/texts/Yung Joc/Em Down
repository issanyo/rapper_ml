[Verse 1 - 8Ball]
It's about the cash flow, it's about the hustle man
It's about the bank roll, it's about the hustle game
We talkin' green money, we breakin' green down
You bustin' swishin' swishes, we burn it by the pound
We talkin' stacks of bricks, whatever it takes to make it
We talkin' crack a his, when they is tryin' to take it
It's about their bad bitch, it's about their pretty car
Taking long trips, and smokin' good cigars
It's about that shoe jane, it's about that new chain
It's about that fresh breath, it's about helpin' yourself
It's about what's in your heart, it's about if you got heart
You gotta be one hundred, nigga finest car

[Hook]
I can't live without it, I gotta go and get it
Money makes the whole world go 'round
And if you talkin' 'bout gettin' it I'm down, I'm down
I can't live without it, I gotta go and get it
Money makes the whole world go 'round
And if you talkin' 'bout gettin' it I'm down, I'm down

[Verse 2 - 2 Chainz]
I have sex to my girl to a rap song (rap song?)
So not even my baby comin' at heart
I tell 'em on to the little bit sour talk
I used to keep eight thous in my sock drawer
Every session is progression, every each is rhyme
One life, no fast forward or rewind
I'm never satisfied, couldn't talk I'm tryin' to climb
You know life's a bitch with no panty line
Money in my Louie bag, it's how I carry mine
Every time you see a nigga it is camera time
Money make the world go round and round
That's why I go block to block, movin' pound for pound

[Hook]
I can't live without it, I gotta go and get it
Money makes the whole world go 'round
And if you talkin' 'bout gettin' it I'm down, I'm down
I can't live without it, I gotta go and get it
Money makes the whole world go 'round
And if you talkin' 'bout gettin' it I'm down, I'm down

[Verse 3 - Yung Joc]
I got bills on top of bills, I got problems just like you
But it is what it is, I gotta solve 'em just like you
I'm ridin' with no ills, I go to jail just like you
Oh yea and I got a baby momma, I catch hell just like you
So miss me with that rap shit, now ain't got no rap shit
That don't mean I've done stuff
That mean I did my shit to stool
I keep a fuckin' banker, every time I hit the streets
Tryin' to get this paper, G 14 that's what she'll sweat
I be bitch, break a bitch, it's a wrap
Buy 'em low, sell 'em high and I care
I went from chrome to bricks to lay 'em down with the straps
Okay now hit it, I feel like ballin' tittie and that's a wrap

[Hook]
I can't live without it, I gotta go and get it
Money makes the whole world go 'round
And if you talkin' 'bout gettin' it I'm down, I'm down
I can't live without it, I gotta go and get it
Money makes the whole world go 'round
And if you talkin' 'bout gettin' it I'm down, I'm down
