Dope boys lose they mind when they hear me comin
All the haters get to runnin when they hear that chopper drummin
Brrrrrrrrrum-pum-pum, brrrrrrrrrum-pum-pum-pumpin

Dope boys lose they mind when they hear me comin
All the haters get to runnin when they hear that chopper drummin
Brrrrrrrrrum-pum-pum, brrrrrrrrrum-pum-pum-pumpin

[Verse One]
Y'all already know me you ain't even gotta wonder
I was voted number one rapper to drop this summer
A one hit wonder, how the hell ya figure that?
My rhymes like crack, fiends screamin gimme dat
A fiend like a monkey in that '73 donk
Need a Desert Eagle reefer smellin like the skunk
Got a bitch named Judy with a real big booty
Boost all day, keep a nigga ridin Coogi
If it's a problem I suggest you let it go
Got some killers over there on Headland and Delowe
I beat the block up, you can hear me when I'm comin
If it's a problem then the choppers start drummin, drummin

[Verse Two]
My niggas flip birds, yo' niggas flip burgers
My niggas got work, yo' niggas just workers
My niggas we get heard, yo' niggas unheard of
My niggas mur-der, yo' niggas get mur-dered
My niggas wet niggas , yo' niggas get drenched
My niggas play the field, yo' niggas ride bench
My niggas is quarterbacks, yo' niggas just receive
When I say go fetch boy, yo' niggas retrieve
My niggas take the coke, and let the shit cook
Yo' niggas experiment with the dope and get hooked
Now ain't that somethin let the story be told
As the plot thickens, the script unfolds

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
I get ya back around three we can do it one mo' gen
Message to them hater middle finger to the wind
Let my chain swang with a limp in my walk
Baby hush your mouth respect a pimp when he talk
E'rybody know that I do it for the hood
Help feed the hungry, now my homies all good
Word on the street, Joc got the heat
Suede on the seat, 28's on my feet
Two bottle of Crist' baby go on spend money
When ya add it up now I'm drinkin rent money
My wrists on froze, make 'em jump up out they clothes
Go on enjoy your night cause in the mornin gotta go (gotta go)
