[Intro: Yung Joc]
Hey love, you remember your first time? (New Joc City)
Get dat with a real nigga? (Block Entertainment)
Well let's talk about it (Bad Boy South)

[Hook: Marques Houston]
It ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shorty, best beware
There ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shorty, you best beware

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
This ain't no love song, mo' like a cut song
You say your day was long, well tell daddy what's wrong
I'ma tell ya one time, just relax and unwind
Whisper sweet nothings now you're blushin' chills down your spine
Oh yeah you hot and tempted, oh no not Pretty Ricky
But when you grind on me, Imma leave you hot and drippin
Slip in those satin sheets, now go and roll over
Oh yeah its up and down motions like a rollercoaster
I see she up on top, you all on my jock
I'ma do it non-stop until your cherry pop
I'ma keep goin' and goin', the Energizer Bunny
Mr Long John all in your tummy

[Hook: Marques Houston]
It ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shawty, best beware
There ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shawty, you best beware

[Verse 2: Yung Joc & Marques Houston]
Won't ya let me introduce ya, to thug Karma Sutra
This ain't no lovey dovey, nah but watch how I seduce ya
Girl I'm the man, I- I- I'm the man
I push the right buttons and the sex on demand
Oh yeah I like it slow, baby, be easy
Ooo, watch ya teeth, baby, be easy
Tell me your Vicky Secrets, tell me all the dirt
You smell like peaches, must be Bath & Body Works
Love the way yo' body work, I'ma make yo' body rock
Once you climax, you feel the aftershock
I know I got you hooked on this lovin
Don't get it twisted, we just cuttin', baby

[Hook: Marques Houston]
It ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shorty, best beware
There ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shorty, you best beware

[Verse 3: Yung Joc]
Yeah, I know I know, I still ain't went soft
But I gotta go, let's hit the shower baby, it's time to rinse off
I'll wash yours, you wash mine, I'll adore it the first time
I blew yours, you blew mines, sometimes I'll drop you a line
But look, don't tell nobody, just keep it on the low
Not your best friend, not your cousin, nobody's gotta know
I know it sounds crazy, but that's just how it is
Yung J-O-C, long live, long live

[Hook: Marques Houston]
It ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shorty, best beware
There ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shorty, you best beware

[Outro: Marques Houston & Yung Joc]

Mmhmm, yeah I know y'all wasn't expectin' that
M.H. and Joc, shorty we gon' give it to ya, girl
