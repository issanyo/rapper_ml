[Hook: repeat 2X]
Ever seen a do or die, ride or die nigga (well I'm him)
Ever seen a nigga flip a pie quicker (well I'm him)
Well have your ever seen a young fly nigga (I'm him)
Well have your ever (I'm him) well have you ever (I'm him)

I'm a grown man, lil' boy get gone
This is my life my hustle my song
Is your maaaad? I'mma mastermind
Hit you with the fo'-five, leave your ass absent-mind
Me a fuck boy? That's asinine (whassup with that?)
Ain't a nann 'nother Chevy out here fast as mine
Twenty-six, no inch with the Alpine
I meet a bitch, break a bitch in my pasttime
I'm the truth dog, that's my word
Do yourself a favor, don't get served (you don't want none)
And if you got questions, here's the business
Gotta stay on top, of your competition
If your work good, just hold out
So when the drought come, e'rybody sold out
That's when your double up, and watch it bounce back
Do that again times ten then your count that

In eighty-eigh I took your J's and your bomber coat
(Take it off nigga) Nowadays it's your J's and your bomber coke
Y'all cats turn gangsta on ProTools
I'mma professional gangsta with pro tools
You got beef? Whoa man
To me you as soft as a wo-man
Bitches'll never know how I get mine
When I put her on the track better get mine (bring it back shawty)
Yeah, that's how it's done 'round here
Quiet as kept (shh) nigga I'm the Don around here
Now check my rap sheet, I ain't a convict
Go to jail, get right out, and they cut shit

[Hook]

[Yung Joc]
I know a lot of cats, real hood niggas (what's happenin)
Some steal, some kill, some good niggas
But they'll never be, quite like me
I love the mighty dollar, that excites me
Yung J-O-C come see me
I got heat, see it up close 3D
I give you brainfreeze, I'm so raw
Like coke turn your cabbage into coleslaw
Squeeze trigs, split your wig like a mohawk
Ya brought it on yourself, it's yo' fault
Now e'rybody on the block know who did it
But uhh, where your body and the dope? Man I hid it
