[Chorus]
I bought a couple bags just so I could fuck
I popped a couple tags just so I could fuck
I threw some rims on the Jag just co I could fuck
Even said I be your man just so I could fuck
That pussy so (good), that pussy so (good)

[Verse 1 - Yung Joc]
I got a bad bitch, let me tell you about her
Compliments me real, hell yeah, she a rider
And every time we fucking on the step she call me daddy
I guess it’s safe to say that I’m her fucking step daddy
If she say she want it, I get it
'Times I feel like Tity: "It's mine, I spend it"
Said she want a condo, down town, got her one
Jaguar on Piedmont took her there, got her one
Know I’m not a trick, I just like to treat
Halloween 6, Freddie Kruger in them sheets
Ha, treat you like my uzzi
Finger fucking till you ooze
Let her blow 20 bands in Gucci, Cash Money like Tunechi

[Chorus]
I bought a couple bags just so I could fuck
I popped a couple tags just so I could fuck
I threw some rims on the Jag just so I could fuck
Even said I be your man just so I could fuck
That pussy so good, that pussy so good

[Bridge - Ebony Love]
I got that X right, got that come back
I love to tussle that nigga tell me run it
He with it. He riding around and he gettin' it
He know as long as he hittin' it, it comes down to those digits

[Verse 2 - 2 Chainz]
No freestyle then we for the paper
Hair weave killer, I’m the undertaker
Take her home, turn of the phone lick on her neck
Drop a tone and make her moan
Wake up my neighbor
All these money on me, I’ma buy some acres
Got so many acres, I’ma buy some neighbors
We can go bag shopping, shawty what’s your favorite
You must have dropped your watch all that time that you wasted
No hesitation, this is celebration
And you never grind, so that’s grind deprivation
No navigation, pussy my location
First I put her on my team, then I put her in rotation

[Chorus]
I bought a couple bags just so I could fuck
I popped a couple tags just so I could fuck
I threw some rims on the Jag just co I could fuck
Even said I be your man just so I could fuck
That pussy so good, that pussy so good

[Verse 3 - Yung Joc] (Ebony Love)
Ah, slanted eyes on the coop, like my car is Asian
Plus the bitch triple white, my cars' Caucasian
Sell the bitch, dreamer, tell her what she wanna hear
Put some stones in her ears, so she can hear me loud and clear
I don’t, I don't do the crowd now it's way too loud in here
Get'cha back to the house, yep we blow it loud in here
In the words of sweet James Jones, bend over let me see the fucking thong
(Would you pay my bills for me?) Yeah, if I gotta keep to
(Would you buy them heels for me?) Louis Vuitton or them Jimmy Choo's?
(Would you steal for me?) Yeah, just so I could keep you, you, you, you

[Chorus]
I bought a couple bags just so I could fuck
I popped a couple tags just so I could fuck
I threw some rims on the Jag just co I could fuck
Even said I be your man just so I could fuck
That pussy so good, that pussy so good
