[Yung Joc]
Is that right? (Block... E-N-T ho!)
Hustlenomic$
A G is what a G does nigga
My momma told me that (E-N-T ho!)
Dro, Bun B, Yung Joc (BLOCK~!)
Let's go

[Hook]
I'm the seventh letter of the alphabet (I'm a G)
And in my pocket it ain't ever nuttin less (than a G)
And if your bitch fucked me she fucked the rest (she a G)
Cause I'mma (A-B-C-D-E-F-G)

[Yung Joc]
You can catch me in the A, check my DNA
What can I say? I'm a G one hundred percent all the way
The block on lock, just like the chain gang
The Hustlenomic$ piece back and forth when the chain swang
I'm blowin grandaddy just so I can maintain
I'm a G and I'll tell your bitch the same thang
Middle finger to ya pussies, nigga no shame
'77 Chevelle, same color cocaine
In ninety-two Ball and 'G were playin in the deck
Out with the younguns nigga, get money and respect
You and that name droppin get you and your mans wet
Nigga I'm a G, now who the fuck you think you playin with?

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Young Dro]
This your boy Young Dro right here
You know I'm a G~! Ay look
Pull up on the scene, bitch I'm cleaner than chlorine
Block star comin, I'm proud of sellin codeine
Shoot a nigga ER from off the street, no beam
Work for my cousin down in Florida named Doreen
All I want is some mo' cream, my wrist on Jack Frost
Tell 'em again they see it man my wrist on Jack Frost
I ain't gotta say how much the motherfuckin Vette cost
Thirty inches touchin on the Escalade, 'llac cost
Bitch I'm from the projects you can miss me wit that rap talk
Catch me up on Section Road, tearin up the asphault
Took a lot if cash and bought, jewelry, 'scuse me
Eights on the dump make it hard to turn steering
Swinging on them niggas, swear I got the fists of fury
Trappin at the hotel, you can catch me at the Drury
A general, I'm surely, man I'm sittin pretty
I got this shit locked, tell momma don't worry

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Bun B]
You see me hop out of a oh-eight, somethin on 24's
Rockin the newest earrings, some next seasons clothes
I guess that's the reason hoes stop drop tuck and roll
Like an inferno, they turn over and suck the pole
I'm so fuckin cold I give a polar bear frostbite
You see my jewelry and you know what it cost right?
You see my toolery it's bigger than your arm so
No tomfoolery and you won't see the bomb blow
Need a bomb ho, Yung Joc got the work
I need some bomb 'dro, "Best Thang Smokin'" got the purp'
Let me hear them on the church, and orchestrate a rendezvous
We meet some boppers, bottles, and don't forget the bombay too
Who, you know who's keepin it trilla
Just name any thug, gangster, soldier, or gorilla
I snatch him up by his shoulders and strip off his stripes
Cause when you trill you don't trip off the height, that ain't my type
