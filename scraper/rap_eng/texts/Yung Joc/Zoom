[Verse 1: Lil' Boosie]
I'm Boosie, Bad Azz and I zoom right by ya
760 partna, krispy kreme on the tires
Smoke that fire purple kush by the pound
Ask my dogg Webbie this is how it goes down
From my hood, to yo hood mayne we makin' money
In the club we poppin' bottles, the room we hittin' models
Rollin through the bottom all the kids hollerin' Boosie
This life a nigga livin like I'm starrin in a movie
Fresh out the jacuzzi, little powder on my chest
Got thirty on my neck, Turk and Mel just cut the check
Now I'm zoomin' in my Charger on them twenty - fo's
Gotta think about Big Head and Pimp, so slow ya roll
Ice cold from my neck to my wrist, we gettin paid
On my feet I got them J's, play with me I got them K's
Red gucci shades, me and Joc gettin paid
Now the whole United States takin' pictures of our face

[Hook]
A fresh pair of J's, I hit the club stuntin
With a fresh pair of shades, makin' that money
Everybody gettin' paid, everything lovely
And I'm doin my thing, my thing, my thing
Everybody like - zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom (Zoom)
We on them dubs like - zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom (zoom)
We walk up in the club like...

[Verse 2 - Yung Joc]
You see the way I hustle, they think I'm Rick Ross
Just as soon as I fuck e'm - tell them hoes to get lost
Alot of niggas mad they all pissed off
If a nigga think he bad tell him jump like Kriss Kross
I pop a couple tags, but the wrist cost
Hate to see me splurge - just bought a brick of soft
Just ask my nigga Boosie he tell you what it is
Face card good cause the face card Trill
Nigga got a problem I suggest you head home
You in the red zone, nigga leave ya head gone
Don't hit me on my chirp nigga, that's the fed phone
You talkin bout the work nigga know you dead wrong
Yeah believe I keep the beams, for them hoes sell e'm dreams
Ain't no hoes on my team - I like my clothes crisp and clean
I like my dough crisp and green, six - fo'on lean
That's my nigga Mouse and Turk who got the drugs for the fiends

[Hook]
A fresh pair of J's, I hit the club stuntin
With a fresh pair of J's, makin that money
Everybody gettin paid, everything lovely
And I'm doin my thing, my thing, my thing
Everybody like - zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom (Zoom)
We on them dubs like - zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom (zoom)
We walk up in the club like...

[Verse 3 - Lil' Boosie]
I be zoomin in my drop top, mobbin thru the city
Fresh fade, fresh J's with two bad bitches
One name Sara, one name Tina
Together they make weather like Katrina
They a fool shawty - red, she a rough rider
She get on back of that motor bike
And all you see is back on that motor bike (WOO)
I drive fast car, they call me Nascar (ya feel me)
But I'm in love with that Hemi
I get retarded in Ferrari's, I get loose in a Coupe
Paranoid like Pac so I keep that Glock when I zoom, zoom
And after that it's to the room, room (I'm V.I.P.)
I need a dime piece, a fine freak
Get on the back, you can ride on the bike or in the 'Lac (huh bruh)
Now we got everybody zoomin, the little kids zoomin
Look like you gotta hit Boosie (yeah)

[Hook]
A fresh pair of J's, I hit the club stuntin
With a fresh pair of J's, makin that money
Everybody gettin paid, everything lovely
And I'm doin my thing, my thing, my thing
Everybody like - zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom (Zoom)
We on them dubs like - zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom (zoom)
We walk up in the club like...
