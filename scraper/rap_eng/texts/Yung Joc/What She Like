And my mind is right, my mind is right

When she yawning

What she like, what she like, what she like oh?
What she like, what she like, what she like oh?

She like it when I tickle that
When I sit it on her back
She like it when I toss that ass up
Flip her like an acrobat
She dig it when I digging that
Squeeze that ass she pleased with that
She like it when I make her lose her mind
Just like that jeezy cat
We was at the Libra on that seagrams and a keyshia pad…
I never said a word an I’m content and I’m gon leave with that
Go creep with that, gon sleep with that
Make her pay a fee for that
She like the way I tax that ass, wax that ass

Them Legs cocked , knees bent, face off in my pillow bitch

When she yawning

Six o’clock in the morning
I wake up to head
She my alarm clock

My breakfast in bed (good mornin)

I like them soft she like them hard
In the morning
I swear to God, I’ma beat it up!
Assault charge!
Fitted hat, to the back

Hotel complaints, the front desk trippin, I just keep on beating it

What she like, what she like, what she like oh?
What she like, what she like, what she like oh?

I make her juice box wet, damn near break her neck
One leg up, and I hit her with the flex
I’m kissing her on her neck
Girl you know what’s next
Scratching up my chest, with her minks all in my flesh
What she like, what she like?
When I’m on my Mr. Marcus shit
Fuckin wit my boots on
Extra grip is hard to slip
What she like, what she like?
When we do it to this song
I toot it and boot it, throw the deuces and I’m gone
Im yellin ohhhhhhhh, I know what she like
I know what she like
I know what she like
Im yellin ohhhhhhhh, I know what she like
I know what she like
I know what she like, in the morning
When she yawning
I like it when she moanin
When she on it
What she like, what she like, what she like oh?
What she like, what she like, what she like oh?
