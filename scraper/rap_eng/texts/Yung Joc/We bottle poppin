I pull up to the club, jumpin out of Rovers
Lookin like a car show, thats the way we roll up
Dope boys showin love, all the hoes know of us
Need extra security, they know they can't control us
I see some niggas hatin, I keep that Super Soaker
So I VIP my way, standin on the sofas
Now watch me demonstrate the way a playa 'possed to
I done buried your weight, you know we throw them toasts up
Say youre gettin guap, well, shawty, we ain't heard bout it
Finna set up shop, well, we ain't even worried bout it
Word on the block, oh, they say you servin pies
I think you need to stop, I got some killers that'll get that work up out 'em
I dont got love for you busta's, unless you my kinfolk
Yeah, you smell that fruity fruit every time the wind blow
I throw away that chump change, Im all about that bigger dough
Joc, he a hood nigga, just like Gorilla Zoe

When the money start droppin all the hoes start jockin
When them hoes start jockin bottles start poppin
When them bottles start poppin you know that we're not stoppin
Ima keep bringin bottles then them models start flockin
Ima throw a stack, she gon' throw it back
I pop the rubber band, she gon' pop her back
She know that I ball, she gon' grind the wall
She gon' bust it open for me and my dawgs
Got boys in the club comin fresh from the trap
Watch them boys cuff their girls cuz they know we got them stacks
We in the middle of the flow from blowin cush packs
I got my workers in the bathroom sellin pill packs
Now the 40 dont stop cuz they know we got that guap
She gon' make her booty clap and Ima throw another knot
When the money still phat they know that its a wrap
Bottle poppin over here, tell the DJ run it back
We bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin

When my nigga Steve died, you know we popped them bottles
Niggas tried to run and hide, we went lookin with them choppers
Now its time to take a ride in that all black Impala
If you niggas think Im lyin' I put that on my momma
And thats why every time his birthday come up
Ima hit the town from sun down to sun up
Buy a couple rounds til they all get drug up
For my nigga Im a clown like the number 1 stunner
Yeah, we in the club, my niggas on a pill or two
Throw that bitch a dub, tell that hoe Im feeling you
Pour her some of this bub, yeah, thats what Im finna do
And then I ask the question, "Shorty what youre in to?"
Then she started blushing, told me bring a friend or two
A whole lot of rubbers, we gon' cut her like a Ginsu
Flexin 'bout some money, thats the shit beginners do
She know Im gettin money and she wanna be a winner too
