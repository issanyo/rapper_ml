[Intro] Yung Joc
Look, we all goin through trials and tribulations. I dont know to many people in the hood that can even fill up they mutha fucking gas tank right now, know what im talking bout. I woke up this morning and I was listening to this record and I said damn man, I could jump on this shit and talk about me, but I said know what, I know a nigga who goin through alot of pain now, lemme speak my mind, Hey Tip..

(Yeah)

Alot niggas scared to say thank yah, but i ain't though
Cause of you i can go places that they can't go
You took me on the king tour with yah, preciate it
You looked me in the and said jov be patient
But i was anxious dog, and im feeling guilty
Ben wouldn't jumped on stage big phil would be still living
I saw yall mash out, we lost a good nigga
Heard the pain in ya voice when i called to see whats good witcha
What do ya know 07 rolls around, we getting big cake
Fucking the baddest hoes around, (Yeah)
I seen bigs witcha, i shoulda let ya know
Tip, i ain't trust that nigga, thats the reason i had to let him go
BET awards right here in the ATL, 20 minutes later TI goes to jail
DAMN, i just seen that nigga, now 20 undercovers on the scene for that nigga

I ain't dead (nah) I ain't done(nah)
I ain't scared(of what), I ain't run(from who)
Still I stand (yeah)
No matter what pimpin here I am
No matter what
I ain't break(never), I ain't fold(never)
They hate me more(so?)
Yeah I know
But here I go
No matter what shortie, here I go
No matter what shortie

You let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
I'm showwed to be jail til 2027
Rather see me in the cell in-
-stead of this new McLaruen
God will take you through hell, just to get you to heaven
So even tho it's heavy, the load I will carry
Grin and still bear it, win and still share it
Apologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it
Life can change ya direction, even when you ain't planned it
All you can do it handle it, worst thing you can do is panic
Use it to your advantage, avoid insanity matters
To conquer, every obstacle, make impossible possible
Even when winning ilogical, losing still far from optional
Yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But, one life throw punches, block the counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside mi castle too long, I did a song
To make it known that the king lives on Pimpin

I ain't dead (nah) I ain't done(nah)
I ain't scared(of what), I ain't run(from who)
Still I stand (yeah)
No matter what pimpin here I am
No matter what
I ain't break(never), I ain't fold(never)
They hate me more(so?)
Yeah I know
But there I go
No matter what shortie, here I go
No matter what shortie

Even in solitude, Theres still no hotter dude
I show you how to do, what you do, you ain't gotta clue
All you do is follow dudes, sound like a lotta dudes
I'll weather whatever storm, make it out without a bruise
I understand why, now when my hands tied
They taken shots cause if I'm out there it's a landslide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckas will get served better know this
Guess it was understood, for me it's over with
But I don't quit, if you ain't noticed yet
They couldn't wait to say goodnight shorty
So they can try to rhyme, act and look like shorty
Go get a beat from toomp, and make a hook like shorty
Before ya know it I'm back what it look like shorty
I lost my partner and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here
Yeah, and I hope the picture painted clear
If your hearts fill with faith then you can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin
Easy, let go and let god deal with it

I ain't dead (nah) I ain't done(nah)
I ain't scared(of what), I ain't run(from who)
Still I stand (yeah)
No matter what VA here I am
No matter what
I ain't break(never), I ain't fold(never)
They hate me more(so?)
Yeah I know
But there I go
No matter what shortie, here I go
No matter what shortie
