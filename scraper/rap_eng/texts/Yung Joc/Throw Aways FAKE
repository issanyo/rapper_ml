Chorus (Yung Joc)
Servin' birds and totin' K's
Chevrolets on top of blades
All of us got throw aways
Bustin' out the Escalade
Bustin' out the Escalade
Bust-bustin' out the Escalade
Bustin' out the Escalade
All of us got throw aways

Verse 1 (Yung Joc)
Whole lotta niggas got a lot to say
Save your breath or state your case
Speak your mind or be on your way
Ain't got time for the games you play
Every nigga in my squad got a strap
Grind hard to put the block on the map
If the city ain't sellin'
And the people ain't yellin'
I'm tellin' ya I'm goin' back hard in the trap
Hustlenomics all I know
Flip that money stack that doe
Think its funny slap that hoe
Take his money text that hoe
Yeah I said it I'll say it again
When I play it I play it to win
Choppa chop of all your limbs
Doc' it ain't no savin' him

Chorus (Yung Joc)

Verse 2 (Trae)
Niggas mad but I'm here for the crown
Mark ass niggas betta lay the fuck down
Homie I'm the king when it come to these streets
You don't wanna go there nigga sit the fuck down
Voices get low everytime I come 'round

If I take you to the hood you will never get found
When I come out with the K
Everybody better pray
If I bust you can hear it from the other side of town
Get a few of these runnin' at you light fast
Dumb fly ass niggas get dropped to the land
Then I got a few goons on stand for a grand
I'm a asshole sittin' with a nice set of hands
G for real I put the H on that
Talk shit bitch I'ma get a case on that
Fucc rap I done put 'em in they place on that
I'm the certified truth goin' off on a track

Chorus (Yung Joc)

Verse 3 (Gorilla Zoe)
Fuccin' with a nigga like me get your whole head bust
Cock back I bust
I stay strapped cuz I love that rush
Hollow point slip when they push your guts nigga
Head on the pillow you in a coffin
Momma she cryin' your kids they orphans
Ain't no shells cuz niggaa we found them
I'm the problem you can't solve him
Cook 'em chop 'em serve 'em shop 'em
We go broke my nigga*a we robbin'
Eat what we kill why you all play possum
Shop witcha boy my product's awesome
We stay strapped one five carbon
18 flat and ain't no bargains
Got my work so we up'ed my margins
It's a drop so yeah I charge 'em

Chorus (Yung Joc)
