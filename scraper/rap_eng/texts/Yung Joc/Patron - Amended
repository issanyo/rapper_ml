Ohh, uh, huh, shit, what up Chino Dolla?
New Joc City', here it is
But right now you 'bout to witness a nigga gone off that Patron
Aight, I'm talkin 'bout seven shots up, y' know what I'm talkin' 'bout?

Seven shots, shit
' Boyz 'N Da Hood ', the next round on you nigga
Now what I want y'all to do? What chu want me to do?
Take that shit to the motherfuckin' head to the flo' nigga, let's go

I just bought a zone, J's on my feet
I'm on that Patron so get like me
I just bought a zone, J's on my feet

E'ry, e'rybody love me, I'm so fly
Niggas throw the deuces e'rytime I ride by
E'ry, e'rybody love me, I'm so fly
Niggas throw the deuces ery'time I ride by

C'mon me tell me what it do? I do it for the A
When the top drop, rock the platinum Cartier
Got that Microsoft so they call me Bill Gates
Ice links 'round my neck lookin' like I build gates

I'm Mr. Amoco, yeah, I got the pumps
Pockets on swoll lookin' like they got the mumps
I'm 'bout my change, gotta get the riches
From the look of thangs y'all gettin' JC Penney's

Pass that Patron, the lime's right thurr
Rock with it, lean with it in my Nike urr
Wink my eye at your bitch now she wishin' she could touch
See the J's on my feet and she love the diamond cuts

Fresh to death, everyday like I jumped up out a caskets
Ask Chino Dolla 'bout that dope boy magic
Connected like apartments, keep one in the cartridge
Chevy seats ostrich, name in the carpet

I mix Patron and Everglow, I call it anti-freeze
Take one sip, her drawers fall to her knees
Mister V.I.P., get it like me
Ice piece on my wifebeat I call it Ice-T

Kush by the seven, I call it Mike Vick
She call me officer, I hit her with my nightstick
My swag so mean need anger management
You call it what you want, I'm on some ol' eleven shit

These niggas wanna hate, God dammit we can handle it
Mad 'cause I got juice, call me Tropicana, bitch
Joc feel good, joc buy the bar
Catch me in the hood pimp, rollin' on a gar

I plead to the judge, I'm guilty of the charge
I'ma ballaholic, can't help it I'ma star
You see the yellow ice, you holla oh my God
Tryin to guess the price, about thirty large

I just bought a zone, J's on my feet
I'm on that Patron so get like me

E'ry, e'rybody love me, I'm so fly
Niggas throw the deuces e'rytime I ride by

E'rybody wanna know, how I do my thang?
Yeah I get money and I let my nuts hang
Pull up to curb, cut it to the left
My rims sittin' tall 'til I dim the knee steps

I just see what I want then I go get it
The apple jelly Chevy with the peanut butter in it
So don't get mad, pimp keep it cool
I hang with them goons and the boys keep them tools
I hustle all day that's just how I live
Stack them big faces, give the strippers dollar bills

Check the dictionary for a P I M P
And when you look it up, partner tell me who ya see?
Young J O C, yeah that's me
Twenty eight G's, on my feet twenty three's
