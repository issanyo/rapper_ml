Inny meeny miny mo
How many bitches from the club won't go
(I know you see it, I know you see it)

Ms. B
I'm like inny meeny miny mo
How many niggas in the club won't go
(I know you see it, I know you see it)

Yung Joc
Now you can call me tipdrill, they playing my song
Throw a couple ones, then she throw away her thongs
When she bust it open, take a picture with my phone
She love my cologne, call it perk body zone
Now she pussy poppin', it's goin' down
Slap the waitress on the booty, tell her "get another round"
And when I make it rain, money all over the ground
Fresh force ones, Sean John button down
And then I'm like "oh boy, a clique fulla stars"
Big four fifth, big dick, and big cars
At the end of the day, when it's all said and done
I need four freaks 'cause I need more than one

(Chorus)
Yung Joc
Inny meeny miny mo
How many bitches from the club won't go
(I know you see it, I know you see it)
I'm like bim bam, I know you want some
She chewing on the dick like a piece of bubble yum
(I know you see it, I know you see it)
Ms. B
I'm like inny meeny miny mo
How many niggas in the club won't go
(I know you see it, I know you see it)
Then I'm like bim bam, I know you want some
You chewing on the pussy like a piece of bubble yum
(I know you see it, I know you see it)

Ms. B
I ain't never been the type to show off in the club
Real laid back poppin' plenty bottles of
Bub, don't smoke but I got much purp
Get that nigga real high, make him slurp it then burp
Could you be a groupie? I hear you singin' my song
Like I see you, lemme feel your tongue
It's me, Ms. B. nigga, let me get you laced
Take a step back, blow the pussy in ya face
I ain't talking cush nigga, talking a rat race
So many to choose from, give 'em all a little taste
Gotta house fulla pussy, the madam of hip hop
My bitches are superstars, so gushy you need a mop
Yea

(Chorus)
Yung Joc
I got stacks on deck, snowflakes on my neck
New J's on my feet, make my outfit complete
(I know you see it, I know you see it)

Ms. B
I got stacks on deck, niggas love my flow
Got a mohawk blowin', air forces that glow
(I know you see it, I know you see it)

Yung Joc
Inny meeny miny mo
How many bitches from the club won't go
(I know you see it, I know you see it)
I'm like bim bam, I know you want some
She chewing on the dick like a piece of bubble yum
(I know you see it, I know you see it)

Ms. B
I'm like inny meeny miny mo
How many niggas in the club won't go
(I know you see it, I know you see it)
