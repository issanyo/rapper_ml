Verse 1- Joc
Damn she pop bars
Plus that lil move that she doin on the flo gotta nigga rock hard
Call me cookie Monsta eat that thang for dinner
You gone fuck around and make me pull it out and put it in ya (in ya)
Juicy, Juice in them thongs when I bend-a
Ova then I cutter like a sword from a ninja
I been stroking, I ain't, in the back of the phantom, legs up, doors open- mayne
Similar to Chris Brown, I teller to run it (Run it)
That arch in her back, now im digging in her stomach
Like a bill collector, she keep runnin from it
Neighbors hearin Screams so they think the house is haunted

(Chorus 1x)- Slim
Verse 2- Joc
I remember that night, at club ?????

I was on Ciroc on the rocks, she was Goosed up
Headed out the door, down the street to the Flame
Your homegirl was working so we went and threw some change
Bout 2 O?clock on the dot we was out
You, Me and her bucket naked on my couch
All I remember, it was in December
Her name was September, munchin on my timber-mayne
Then I went and pinned her down and we was round two?n it
And you was in the middle of us two an? now we doin it
Blowin on my blowpop, Now they both is chewin it
By the way they do it I can tell they ain't new to this

(Chorus 1x)- Slim
(Joc) Ha Ha that?s right, we gone end this thing right
Aye, Lets Go

Verse 3- Joc
When im on my tippy toes, you know im in my zone
She want me to beep beep all night long
And play wit that pussy, I man up in it
Im juggin in her box, I stand up in it
I said im playin wit that pussy, I man up in it
Im juggin in her box, watch me stand up in it

(Chorus 1x)- Slim
See imam give em what they want
Why not?
