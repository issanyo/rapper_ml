[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
Well, I must say everything cool in the game
Between me and you, baby
You be doing your thang
Girl, you make me 'bout to lose it when you call my name
And I really dig the way your booty bang!

[Verse 2: Jessi Malay]
One snap of my finger
And I clear out your whole crew
I put on my Sunday best and they go get a spoon
One look at my hair
And they ask, "Is it Vidal Sassoon?"
I put on my low rides and they howl at my moon!
(Boom!)

[Hook: Jessi Malay]
I'mma give 'em something to talk about
A reason to keep my name in they mouth
Every time I come through
I turn it out
'Cause my booty bangs! (Watch me) (2x)

[Verse 3: Jessi Malay]
I'm so super sexy
Bet she can't do it like me
I push up the twins
And you get scared and take a seat

I'm the shit in real life
You just look good on TV
If you watch me closely
You might learn a thing or three!

[Bridge: Jessi Malay]
Why you gots to do her like that?
I know you're mad I had to come back
Why you gots to do her like that?
'Cause I'm sexy as hell with my toned-up legs
Now WATCH ME!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Yung Joc]
Ay, you know what?
I got Swiss on the wrist
Haters can't afford this
Tryin' to climb to the top of the Forbes list
Yeah, the game I spit's sorta like an oil slick
No offense, I ain't gotta say it
You know I'm the shit!

I only got one question
Tell me, what you gonna do
When a boss player drop big pimpin' on you?
[?] stilletos
I got you geeked up
All the suckers want this spot
But they can't keep up!

Now won't you run and tell them suckers go play, okay?
No time for them sucker cliches, no way!
Your booty bang, Jessi Malay
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!
(Watch me!)

[Hook]

[Outro: Jessi Malay (Yung Joc)]
I'mma give 'em something to talk about
A reason to keep my name in they mouth
Every time I come through
I turn it out
'Cause my booty bangs!
Watch me!
