When I drop the work in the pot it bounce back like elastic
How you do that I call it Dope Boy Magic
Watch me work them plays like that 95 Madden
How you do that I call it Dope Boy Magic

I get it nine in the mornin by night it just plastic
How you do that I call it Dope Boy Magic
I'm fresh ta death everyday like I jumped up out a casket
How you do that I call it Dope Boy Magic

[Verse 1]
I'm numba one to turn a pair of Bo Jackson Raiders and two
A fresh pair of Mauri allgators three
Out of ten niggas is some haters before it's to late five shots to your tater
Six hundred chromed fronted cotton candy coated Benz
Seven grams of presidental blowin in the wind
At 4 A.M.the eight at nine touchdown a beautiful play
In my neighborhood so what now got one
O left you can snatch it for the seven nigga
Keep your chirp on alert just like nine eleven the
12 creepin threw the hood like jason keep it movin
Friday 13th but bitch this ain't a movie
I was only 14 when I dropped my first deal
Made a two-way disappear like David Copperfield
Wala, I recorded this a 2 15 left dope boy magic beating through your 15's

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Chino is the dopest work the water like Moses
Tadow check my footwork, It's Dope Boy Magic
How it match my ice and t-shirt, I'm packin and stackin bread
Duckin and dodgin feds, a ho with some good head, shawty I love dat
It ain't no secret just look at my 26's every time you see me
Make you move like Russell Simmons
Check my position, I'm the boss of some wise guys
Wanna know some, we'll teach you how birds fly
Show you how gats cry, trap or your fuckin die hit it with the soda
Bring it back with some fi fi
Oh my look what it done to me
That Dope Boy Magic got me rich as I want be
Say oh my look what it done to me
That Dope Boy Magic got me rich as I want be

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm some like David Blaine
When it come to movin this cane
Ten years off in the game
Y'all niggas just doin this thang
Concrete niggas straight from the street
Different bitch everyday of the week
Different wheels with the different feet
Keep my pistol off on my beat
Puttin that work till the dope is sold
Every other day got brand new clothes
Every Cadillac got brand new boes
Candy pain with the suicide do's
Makin deals, I'm a grab my phone
Feds tappin on my phone
Hatin cause a nigga money long
Dope Boy Magic made this song
Magic city gone buy a bitch
Hood niggas is gonna stay hood rich
Ridin round them foreign whips
Let my car straight pull a bitch
Dope Boy niggas gone ride with me
Suck up game, I charge a fee
If you never heard of me
