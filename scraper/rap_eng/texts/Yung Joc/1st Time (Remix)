[Intro: Yung Joc]
Hey love, you remember your first time? (New Joc City)
Get dat with a real kid? (Block Entertainment)
Well let's talk about it (Bad Boy South)

[Hook: Marques Houston]
It ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shorty, best beware
There ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shorty, you best beware

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
This ain't no love song, mo' like a cut song
You say your day was long, well tell daddy what's wrong
I'ma tell ya one time, just relax and unwind
Whisper sweet nothings now you're blushin' chills down your spine
Oh yeah you hot and tempted, oh no not Pretty Ricky
But when you grind on me, I'm gon' leave relieve your symptoms
Just slip in them satin sheets, move a lil closer
Take you on the scream machine like a roller coaster
Let's turn it up a notch, kiss your hot spot
I'ma do it non-stop until your legs lock
I'ma keep goin' and goin', the Energizer Bunny
Mr. Make You Feel Good, what you want from me?

[Hook: Trey Songz]

[Verse 2: Yung Joc & Marques Houston]
Won't ya let me introduce ya, to thug Karma Sutra
This ain't no lovey dovey, nah but watch how I seduce ya
Girl I'm the man, I'm the man
You love in my mouth, not in my hands
Oh yeah I like it slow, baby, be easy
Gon' dip it low, baby, be easy
Tell me your Vicky Secrets, tell me all the dirt
You smell like peaches, must be Bath & Body Works
Love the way yo' body work, I'ma make yo' body rock
You take a deep breath, you gon' feel the aftershock
I know I got you hooked on this lovin
Don't get it twisted, we just cuttin', baby

[Hook: Marques Houston & Trey Songz]
It ain't nothing like the first time

[Verse 3: Yung Joc]
Yeah, I know I know, your lips so soft
But I gotta go, let's hit the shower baby, it's time to rinse off
I'll wash yours, you wash mine, I'll adore it the first time
You got yours, I got mine, sometimes I'll drop you a line
But look, don't tell nobody, just keep it on the low
Not your best friend, not your cousin, nobody's gotta know
I know it sounds crazy, but that's just how it is
Yung J-O-C, long live, long live

[Hook: Marques Houston & Trey Songz]
It ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shorty, best beware
There ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shorty, you best beware
