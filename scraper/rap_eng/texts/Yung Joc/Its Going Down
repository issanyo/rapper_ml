(Into)
This a nitty beat (boing)
Here we go again
Ghettoville U.S.A. (uh Oh)
You know I go by the name Nitti right (uh huh)
I gotta introduce you to another motherfucker out my squad right (who dis nigga mane)
Dis nigga go by the name of joc (joc?)
He resides in collegepark (collegepark cp)
But for right now what we gotta do for y'all (what we gonna do)
We gotta give y'all a hit (huh)

(Verse 1)
Niggas in my face
Damn near er' day
Askin a million questions like
Joc where ya stay
Tell 'em collegepark
Where they chop cars
In 20 grand spend a grand at the bar
Just bought a zone jays on my feet
I'm on that patron so get like me
69 cutlass wit the bucket seat
Beat in my trunk ballin just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood posted at the sto
Pistol in my lap on the phone countin dough
If a girl chews let her do her thang
Just like her mama nice ass, nice brain
Er'body love me I'm so fly
Niggas throw the duces er'time I ride by
I know ya wonder why
I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what cha do (ok)

(Hook)
Meet me in the trap its goin down
Meet me in the mall its goin down
Meet me in the club its goin down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

(Verse 2)
Verse numba 2 do the damn thang
Cubes on my neck pockets full of ben franks
When I'm in the mall hoes just pause
I pop a few tags give me that on the wall
Time to flip the work make the block bump
Boys from the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope boi magic seven days a week
Numba one record long as Nitti on the beat
Oh I thank they like me betta yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggas know my crew we certified stars
Valet in the front 'bout 35 cars
Bitches in the back
Black beamer coups
Girls likin girls time to recruit
If ya got a problem say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time any place

(Hook)
Meet me in the trap its goin down
Meet me in the mall its goin down
Meet me in the club its goin down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

(Verse 3)
Time to set it off let these nigga know
Have ya every seen a Chevy wit the butterfly doors?
I ride real slow no need to speed
Gotta make sure ya see the buckets on my feet
Feds on my trail but they don't thank I know
I keep my hands clean cuz I never touch dope
Every time I see 'em look 'em in the eye
Ask 'em how I know its me, surprise!
Put it in the air rip where ya stay
Take a step back blow the kush in they face
Stuntin is a habit let 'em see the karats
I'ma make it rain nigga I ain't scared to share it

(Hook)
Meet me in the trap its goin down
Meet me in the mall its goin down
Meet me in the club its goin down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

(Outro)
Yung Joc?!
Nitti strikes again
This a Nitti beat
