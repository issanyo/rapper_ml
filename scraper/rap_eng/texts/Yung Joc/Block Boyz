The reason y'all ain't blowin' up, cause you too lazy, (get up bitch)
That's why I don't do niggas favors, fuck you pay me

[Verse 5: Big Duke]
Now from Candler Road to Glenwood
Whole life been hood, we don't talk, we get to it
Block a day we went through it
Can't you tell with forty shells where I dwell
Eastside the ATL, the closest thing I been to hell
Home of the cutthroats, big dope and robbin' crews
This is Block Ent, we don't know how to lose
Bang it out, shoot it out, it don't matter, you can choose
Evil muthafuckas we gon take you back to school

[Verse 6: Yung Joc]
My nigga welcome to my block, where the hustle don't stop now, (stop now)

My nigga Big Block call me up, (call me up)
He said yung nigga what the fuck is up, (fuck is up)
I said I'm with it, if you with it, let's go, (let's go)
Hop in the chevy, hit the gas and get loaded

[Verse 7: Gorilla Zoe]
I done played every side, zone, hood and every slum, (slum)
I live by two rules, get money, bar none, (none)
See most these niggas flexin', lyin' bout where they from, (from)
Not respected in they hood, they sweet and soft like bubblegum
A lot of these niggas pussy, they ain't built like the don
Any type of confrontation, they run like Vince Young
And I'll bust a nigga gun when it come to my funds
Welcome to my block, drugs, money, sex and guns

[Verse 8: Durty]
I'm a hood nigga, the block is where I'm hangin' out (ha)
Started seein' quarter ounces, now I'm seeing birds fly
Yung dirty'll bust yo shit, just to let you know dawg (that's right)
Menace to Society, the real life O-Dog (haha)
Block Ent, ain't no fuck niggas harmin' this
Trappin' pushin' pills like a CVS pharmacist (haha)
