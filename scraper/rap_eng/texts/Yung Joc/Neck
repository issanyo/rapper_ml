[Hook: Yung Joc]
I woke up this morning, to an ass so enormous
Already bitch in my bed, she be an all night performance
She 'bout to preach for the lord, I think she want to come join us
Told her I want some action, baby let's start recording
I want that neck, neck, neck, neck, neck, neck, neck
(Girl I want that) wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet
(Ain't about my) check, check, check, check, check, check, check
(You love the way I) flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
Got an avatar named Blue, swear to god she bout 6 'sum
Thick some, fucked her all night, kicked her out 'bout 6 'sum
Got a room for one night, on the 6th floor, it cost 6 'sum
Got a call from Chi, say God you don't feel like 6 of 'em
So I slip on my Louis Vuittons, the cheapest pair cost 6 'sum
Valet go get the whip, he say which one, all six 'em
I pick one and I hop in, that drop Benz on 6 'sum
Thank god for this here car

[Verse 2: Yung Joc]
My Coutore came from Europe, I'm on my
I feel like Shakira, I fuck hoes by the plural
I'm leaning out the sir, my money mature
That shit go so fast, it feels like a blur
No love for these bitches, these hoes insecure
No love for these niggas, ball hardcore, 'er
Get her to the crib, take her on a tour
Saw them battery that pussy, I might need a juror
