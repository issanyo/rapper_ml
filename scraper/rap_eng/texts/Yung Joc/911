[Pre-Chorus: Yung Joc]
Shawty gotta problem
It's ok 911
I'm on, im on tha way
I know what it take
Grab you by tha waist
I'ma lay it down and have myself a taste
I'ma slow it down, down, down
I'ma speed it up, up, up
And we gon roll around,round,round
And I'ma beat it up, up, up

[Chorus: Yung Joc]
I'm, I'm on tha way
I'm on tha way
911, 911
I'm, I'm on tha way
I'm on tha way
911, 911

[Verse 1: Wale]
Ohhhhhhh, couple diva's standin on tha couch
We out standing while you mother fuckers standing out
And to be honest I don’t know what niggas talkin bout
We trying to run the city, you niggas run your mouth
I gotta little clout
DMV they know me well
Bitch got all them booty shots
That’s what I call a fairy tale
You give bitches tiffany
I give bitches dick and leave
You be in they call log
I delete they history
When you talkin illest rapper
How you not gon mention me
Ballin, them box scores, and yall shit be dnp
Lobsters and shrimp im good
Cocktail to get my bizz
Apollo to these broads
Rub the wood and ima show em love

[Pre-Chorus: Yung Joc]
Shawty gotta problem
It's ok 911
I'm on, im on tha way
I know what it take
Grab you by tha waist
I'ma lay it down and have myself a taste
I'ma slow it down, down, down
I'ma speed it up, up, up
And we gon roll around,round,round
And I'ma beat it up, up, up

[Chorus: Yung Joc]
I'm, I'm on tha way
I'm on tha way
911, 911
I'm, I'm on tha way

911, 911

[Verse 2]
Look look uh
I'm tryin' to get this whole place jumpin
Be as your way
Gotta make a way ta skate wit us
I told her move somethin'
I said shake somethin'
She told me erything is real

Weaved up, fly shit, sleeved up
High shit im treed up
Lookin Vietnamese up
Hate it when I leave
And she say she can't live witout it
Ok I hear you talkin
Now moneys talkin louder
Standin on a table
This motha fucka crowed

And bijies like im out and
She love me
She like that
I make her cum a lot
She always comin back

[Pre-Chorus: Yung Joc]
Shawty gotta problem

Grab you by tha waist
I'ma lay it down and have myself a taste
I'ma slow it down, down, down
I'ma speed it up, up, up
And we gon roll around,round,round
And I'ma beat it up, up, up

[Chorus: Yung Joc]
I'm, I'm on tha way
