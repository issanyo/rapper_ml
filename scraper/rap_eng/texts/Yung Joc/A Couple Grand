A couple grand price tag on your head leave you laying where you stand
A couple grand price tag on your head on your head on your your head
A couple grand price tag on your head price tag on your head
A couple grand price tag on your head leave you laying where you stand

[Verse 1]
Watch him die slow then his eyes roll in the back of his head
Now his body cold a couple grand a couple shots
Couple drip drops now your leakin won't stop bitch
I'm the man just ask block
Shots rang out you could hear it for a couple blocks
Bitch whats my name call me Yung Joc
I got a great aim all I need is one shot
Everybody talking in my neighborhood I got great lawyers
Cause my paper good leave your body riddled wheezing and coughing
Hear about it live Fox Five with Monica Coffin
You fuck with mine I'll cause your life line
I'm a graffiti paint chalk outlines
And the worst part (What it is) is I'm not a coward
Visit your wake and give your mama dead flowers

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
This is not a movie (cut) no reruns (aww)
All sales final no refunds
Once I make the payment the hits out
I'm not Jeezy I ain't swappin shit out
First I tell'em (what you tell'em)
Where I what done in the back yard
Ight in front of your son then I tell'em (what you tell'em)
Where to drop him off in the Chattahoochie
With his dick chopped off (damn)
Yeah it sounds harsh but it's well deserved
Feed his ass to the sharks for hors d'oeuvres
No remorse no pity
This could happen to you in New Joc City

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I gotta couple killers down in free trail
Put glass in your boogie shit your guts leak out
The sheriff call your mother and she freak out
Got her hittin member up got him on speed dial
Ooh it ain't nothing but a call away
Come home find your baby sister in the hallway
911 but it's too late
She looking like a maxi pad bleeding through the duct tape

[Hook]
