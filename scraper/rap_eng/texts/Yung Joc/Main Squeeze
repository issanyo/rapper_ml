This song right here this that medicine
Urban Mystic, hmm yeah, Young J O C
This one right here dedicated to all the number one's out there
You know what I'm talkin' about

I ain't talkin' 'bout the bust it baby's
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
I'm talkin' 'bout the ones you don't mind going home to
If you chose to ya dig this what I'm talkin' 'bout

Aye, look I love her like my Nina Ross, that's my main squeeze
Lil' mama take it off you know I aim to please
I let her lick the rapper, she like my lollipop
Like a jaw breaker until I tell her stop

I'm stutterin' she make my toes curl
She said who's is it daddy? I said it's yours girl
Joc don't play games, Joc play for keeps
That's the reason she's my main squeeze 7 days a week

Eat her like ice cream, treat her like ice cream
She treat me like a lollipop, she treat me like a lollipop
I like the way the girl scream, girl scream, girl scream
She hold it 'til the last drop, she hold it 'til the last drop

When I wake up in the morning, when I wake up in the morning
I get her feeling horny, feeling kinda horny
She make me feel good, she make me feel good
I be feeling like morning, feeling like morning

Then she make my breakfast, my breakfast
Talk'n 'bout gritz and eggs
When she ask for the car, when she ask for the car
I tell her go ahead, go ahead

That's my girl, that's my girl and she rocks my world
Rocks my world
It don't matter what it is, the time, or the reason
My girl give it to me, she give it to me, ohh

Shawty got me feelin' good
She give that thug love good like a nigga like
I ain't never gotta worry 'cause shorty getting' it right
She my main squeeze, she's my main squeeze, ohh

Shawty keep it straight hood
She's a freak in the sheets and the sex good
I ain't never gotta worry 'cause shorty getting' it right
She my main squeeze, she's my main squeeze, ohh

She got me on her iPod, she got me on her iPod
Every time my song play, song play
She like it with the lights on, like it with the lights on
'Cause I freak her in the best way, best way

When we go to the mall, to the mall
We ball like a dawgg, yes sir
Runnin' in and out of stores, fits and fresh clothes
Just in case you ain't know, I do it

That's my girl, that's my girl and she rocks my world
Rocks my world
It don't matter what it is, the time, or the reason
My girl give it to me, she give it to me, ohh

Shawty got me feelin' good
She give that thug love good like a nigga like
I ain't never gotta worry 'cause shorty getting' it right
She my main squeeze, she's my main squeeze, ohh

Shawty keep it straight hood
She's a freak in the sheets and the sex good
I ain't never gotta worry 'cause shorty getting' it right
She my main squeeze, she's my main squeeze, ohh

My girl's so fine, she's one of a kind
She's shaped just like a bottle, she could be somebody's model
I got her off MySpace, now she back at my place
You wish your girl be this fine, but I tell 'em

She mine, she mine, she mine, she mine, she mine
She mine, she mine, she's mine, she a dime, she a fine
She mine, she mine, she mine

Uhh, Urban Mystic, aye look
You ain't never heard the name, get used to it
Young J O C, aye look
Mama this one right here is dedicated to you and you
Hold up, hold up, hold up, yup, I like the big girls too
