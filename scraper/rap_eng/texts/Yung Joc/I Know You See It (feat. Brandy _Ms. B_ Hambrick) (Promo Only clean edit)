[Intro: Yung Joc] + (Ms. B)
Eenie, meeny, miney, moe
How many girls from the club won't go
I knowwww you see it; I knowwww you see it)
(I'm like Eenie, meeny, miney, moe)
How many players in the club won't go
(I knowwww you see it, I knowwww you see it)

Yung Joc
Now you can call me tip drill, they playing my song
Throw a couple ones, then she throw away her thongs
When she bust it open, take a picture with my phone
She love my cologne, ???
Now she jockin', it's goin' down
Slap the waitress on the booty, tell her "get another round"
And when I make it rain, money all over the ground
Fresh force ones, Sean John button down
And then I'm like "oh boy, a clique fulla stars"
Big four fifth, big d**k, and big cars
At the end of the day, when it's all said and done
I need four freaks 'cause I need more than one

(Chorus)
Yung Joc
Eenie, meeny, miney, moe
How many girls from the club won't go
(I knowwww you see it, I knowwww you see it)
I'm like bim (bim) bam (bam) I know you want some (some)
She chewing on the d**k like a piece of bubble yum
(I knowwww you see it, I knowwww you see it)

[Hook 2: Ms. B]
Eenie, meeny, miney, moe
How many players in the club won't go
(I knowwww you see it, I knowww you see it)
Then I'm like bim (bim) bam (bam) I know you want some (some)
You chewing on the butt like a piece of bubble yum
(I knowwww you see it, I knowwww you see it)

[Ms. B]
I ain't never been the type to show off in the club
Real laid back poppin' plenty bottles of
Bub, don't smoke but I got much purp
Get that nigga real high, make him slurp it then burp
Could you be a groupie? I hear you singin' my song
Like I see you, lemme feel your tongue
It's me, Ms. B. n***a, let me get you laced
Take a step back, blow the pussy in ya face
I ain't talking kush n***a, talking a rat race
So many to choose from, give 'em all a little taste
Gotta house fulla p***y, the madam of hip hop
My bitches are superstars, so gushy you need a mop
Yea

(Chorus)
Yung Joc
I got stacks on deck, snowflakes on my neck
New J's on my feet, make my outfit complete
(I know you see it, I know you see it)

[Ms. B]
I got stacks on deck, n***as love my flow
Got a mohawk blowin', air forces that glow
(I know you see it, I know you see it)

[Yung Joc]
Eenie meeny miney, moe
How many girls from the club won't go

I'm like bim bam, I know you want some
She chewing on the dick like a piece of bubble yum
(I know you see it, I know you see it)

[Ms. B]
I'm like Eenie meeny miney, moe
How many players in the club won't go
(I know you see it, I know you see it)
