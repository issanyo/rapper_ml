Might as well, might as well, might as well
Trap stupid (boy you comin through)
Club jumpin (boy you comin through)
My girlfriend say she ain't wanna fuck with you

Roll a blunt for me, and roll one for you
Fuck with me, you're fuckin with the whole crew
Say whattttt (might, might, might as well)

Joc eyeball the purp, I don't need no scale
Got a real trap house, and real clientele
Buy 72, the biggest motor chevy made
Built 7 on the horses, real heavy weight
I get head then cake, everyday my birthday
Birthday sex with your bitch, fuck her everyway
Bought to mount it up, goin throw them 30's on it
Paint stupid wet, boy i put my ladies on it
Im a guap boy, body all mugged up
Tryin to be a hot boy, get your body ___
In high school I brought jewels for show and tell
Oh well I'm fly as hell, might as well

Smash that, make you tires scream like a choir
Stare at me with butterflys like mariah
I bought them all, and all the tires I desire
Swag team I started my own empire
3 strikes and the judge be the umpire

So i do my dirty night like a vampire
I aim higher than you could put your lighters
I hope you got heat, my whole team fire fighters
My sway make your granny wet, make you change her diapers
The bitch that you with...pshhh I one night her
Rowdy rowdy typer, that boy ring bells
Beat that nigga til he swells, might as well

Trap stupid (boy you comin through)

Cuz of your shades, fresh fade, make em look

Crawlin out the chevy, what you sittin on
Oh halle berry I wanna take her home
