Hold up (hold up)
Wait a minute (wait a minute)

Baby you're so sexy
Can't put into words
So I say ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh

Don't know what you do to me
And I can't find the words
Make me say ooh-ooh-ooh (ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1:]
Boy, I can see you over there lookin' fly as ever
If I let you go
Couldn't forgive myself
Gotta let you know what your eyes do to me

They way you look at me
You can see right through me
Baby, when you walk
I can see that swagger

The ladies lookin' at you
But they can't have ya
Let 'em know you're mine
Baby you're all mine

[Hook:]
Baby you're so sexy
Can't put into words

Don't know what you do to me
And I can't find the words
Make me say ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 2:]
You know it's been a few years
And you still got it
Always keep it fresh
Always keepin' it hot and
Don't worry 'bout them haters

They can say whatever
When it's all said and done
We gon' still be together

The way you lick ya lips
Still do somethin' to me
And it feels even better when you say that you love me

Darlin'

So glad that I'm with you

Shawty, you so fly
Everytime you walk by

You seem to make temperature rise

Make me say
Oooh I

[Bridge:]
Baby, this is how I feel
The way you kiss me gives me chills
A feeling I just can't explain

So good
I don't know what to say, so

Ladies, if you got a man
Just take him by the hand
And oooh, ooooh, ooooh

Fellas, if you with your lady
Let her know that she's your baby
And she's the only one for you
Ooh

[Repeat hook 2x:]
