[Chorus: ]
I know what she like
I know what she like in the morning!
When she’s lonely
I like it when she moanin'
When she on it
What she like, what she like, oh?
What she like, what she like, oh?
What she like, what she like, oh?

[Verse 1: ]
She like it when I tickle that
When I sit it on her back
She like it when I toss that ass
Or flip her like a acrobat
She dig it when I dig in that
Squeeze that ass she pleased with that
She like it when I make her lose her mind
Just like that jeezy cat
We was on that [?]
I never said a word [?]
I'mma leave with that, gon creep with that
Gon sleep with that, make her pay a fee for that
She like the way I tax that ass, wax that ass
Now bring it back
Them legs cocked, knees bent, face off in my pillow
Bitch
She scremin' joc cause she in shock
[?]
She like it in the mornin
[?]

[Chorus: ]
I know what she like
I know what she like
I know what she like
I know what she like
I know what she like in the morning!
When she’s lonely
I like it when she’s…
When she’s..
What she like, what she like, what she like, oh?
What she like, what she like, what she like, oh?
What she like, what she like, what she like, oh?

[Verse 2: ]
Six o’clock in the mornin
I wake up to head
She’s my alarm clock
My breakfast in bed
I like them red
I like them dark
I like it soft, She like him hard
In the morning
I swear to God I’ma beat it up!
Assault charge

[Chorus: ]
She lovin’ it!
She touch her toes!
I’m touching it
I know!
To be told,…
Cause she keep on dreaming it
Oh,…complaints… I just keep on beating it
[Chorus]
I know what she like
I know what she like
I know what she like
I know what she like!
I know what she like in the morning!
When she on it
When she’s lonely
I like it when she’s…
When she’s..
What she like, what she like, oh?
What she like, what she like, oh?
What she like, what she like, oh?

[Verse 3: ]
[?]
I’m kissing her on the knee
Girl you know…
Scratching on my…
What she like, what she like?
What she like, what she like?
[?]
What she like, what she like?
What she like, what she like?

[Outro: ]
I know what she like it
I know what she like it!
I know what she like it
I know what she like it!
In the morning, what she own it
What she moan it
What she like, what she like, oh?
What she like, what she like, oh?
What she like, what she like, oh?
