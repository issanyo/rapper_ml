Say my name when I beep, beep, beep
We can do it in the pool or the jeep, jeep, jeep
'Cause girl you know your turnin' me on

Turn you out let me sneak a peak
Turn you out on the late night creep
Ain't playin no games tonight

[Chorus: Bobby V]

[Verse 3: Yung Joc]
I can tell the way she watchin' me
She love the way I swag out
Got enough to go around
Might as well pass it out
She said she like the way I work her out till she passin' out
Wanna be with a star well mama I'm a astronaut
Let her lick the wrapper I call that the jaw breaker
If her back was the law then call me a law breaker
Love the way she roll her hips
Is like she on the bean shoppin'
Make her lose her boy just like she on the scream machine
She said my Cavalli cologne be turnin' her on
And she a fiend because my black snake be makin' her moan
Like beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
All night we gon' freak, freak, freak, freak, freak

[Chorus: Bobby V]
Shorty been eyein' me
She lookin' like she thinkin' 'bout tryin' me
She want it she can't take no more
I'm 'bout to take her to my spot
I'm a get it hot, she gonna turn around and let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
She gon' let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
I am tear it up when I
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
She gon' let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep
I'm a have her screamin' like
Go, go, go, go, go, go
I'm a have her screamin' like
Go, go, go, go, go, go
I'm a tear it up

[Outro: Bobby V]
I'm a do it just like that
I'm a do it just like that
