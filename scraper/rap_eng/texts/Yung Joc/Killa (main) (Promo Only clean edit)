Cherish
They make me wanna lose control
Yea
You know who it is

Im in a wife beater two seater cruise control
Pull up and ya girl might lose control
Not playas circle but a duffel bag boy
Guarantee they can't get enough of dat boy

Saw him from a distance and i watched him make his way to the floor
He walked up to me slowly whispers and he says i know who you are, i wanna get to know you
I can tell he was a player but he knows just how to make ya lose control
Somehow i knew..

Shawty is a killa
But i really want him
And i gotta have him tonight
Straight heart breaker
But it really dont matta
Cause i really want him tonight

The way he licks his lips im in a infatuated state of mind
Oooh yea
Hes so hard to resist
I got to tell ya baby boy is so fine
Just got ta have you
Ooh yea'

I can tell he was a playa
But he knows how to make ya lose control
If you only knew..

But shawty is a killa
And i really want him
And i got to have him tonight
Straight heart breaker
But it really dont matter
Cause i really want him tonight

Shawty is a killa but i really want him
And i gotta have him..tonight...
Straight heart breaker..heart breaker

But it dont really matta
Cause i really want him..
Cause i really want him tonight...tonight..

Ooo...it feels so wrong that it must it must be right
And im so high, dont wanna come down just let me fly

Ay ay let me talk to um
My whips push but no car keys man
Pop the top like a sardine can
Wrist stay flooded like New Orleans man

Lil boy can't stop i be ballin man
Yea im pretty sure dat ya heard da rumors
Got beef bull wit some big cawholas
Im a pretty slick nigga like rick da rula
Keep one eye open and my hand on dat ruda
I rock da cladio
My shades gazel
I break hearts
I heartbreak hotels
I treat yo chick like a pair of ones
Wear ha ass out one good time and shawty...

Shawty is a killa
But i really want him
And i gotta have him tonight
Straight heart breaker
But it really dont matta
Cause i really want him tonight

And i gotta have him tonight

Straight heart breaker
But it really dont matta
Cause i really want him tonight
