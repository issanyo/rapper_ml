I believe I can fly, fly, fly
I believe I can fly, fly, fly
I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high

I believe I can fly, fly, fly
I believe I can fly, fly, fly
I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high, I believe I can fly

Bitch I'm sittin' so high, I believe I can fly
The coupe looks delicious, the rims are waving bye
Money long like Diddy, I put on for my city
Cologne Kush and Henny, I'm gone in that hemi
I'm gold but you don't hear me
Four to the dome if you can hear me

I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high

They say I need a pull up, when I pull up I'm the shit man
When I grow up I wanna be like T-Pain, a hit man
But do yourself a favor partner, don't be talkin' shit man
You're broad done up and broke your heart
My whole squad hit man

Hold up I see dead people
It's just the dead white guys on my bread people

Fly, fly, fly, I believe I can fly, fly, fly
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high

I believe I can fly, fly, fly
I believe I can fly, fly, fly
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high
I believe I can fly

I'm high as the moon and I'm flier than a mosquito
Stackin' my chips, I got a bag full of Doritos
I'm too cool for school so I'm teachin' a class
Chiefin' on that purple rain partner, puff, puff, pass

See I'm higher than the price of gas, gone off vanilla cream
Rollin' off of Mac Dre leanin' like a triple beam
I got my wrist froze up like computer screens
So fresh, so clean exhale sticky green

I got the top steady droppin' like record sales
Paint changin' colors like Tyra Bank's finger nails
Choose the fast life, I'm the flashy type
Diamonds in my mouth sparkle look like sprite
'Cause I'm fly

Fly, fly, fly, I believe I can fly, fly, fly
I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high

I believe I can fly, fly, fly
I believe I can fly, fly, fly
I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high, I believe I can fly

I believe I can lean spite and codeine
Someone's sleepin' on the scene
That's a hell of a dream, I'm a hell of a guy
That's a hell of a blunt, fire it up, lets' get high

You can call me G five 'cause I be in the clouds
Somewhere in the club with my clothes smellin' loud
And never will I smile 'cause I be bitin' down
Rollin' off a P probably muggin' with a frown

But no, ain't nothin' wrong how could he be on rich
Bitch looked at my whip, bitch looked at my wrist
My wrist is tricked in ice, my neck is dripped in ice
Bitch look at my life, don't you wanna be my wife?

Would you like to be my girl?
Don't you wanna change your life?
I can change your life
Grab the credit card and swipe, like see?

Fly, fly, fly, I believe I can fly, fly, fly
I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high

I believe I can fly, fly, fly
I believe I can fly, fly, fly
I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high, I believe I can fly

Fly, fly, fly, I believe I can fly, fly, fly
I'm so high, I'm so high
