[Bridge]
If I need the work I'mma call my chulo
Fuck her by myself, she can't take the duo
Still want the same bitch, I can't trust a new hoe
Off two bars on the playin', for like I'm not secure

[Hook]
What you mean, bitch, tell me what you mean, ayy
Your man crushing putting xannies in your lean, ayy
I need a bean, tell your friend to come between, ayy
What you mean, bitch, tell me what you mean (ayy ooh)
What you mean, bitch, tell me what you mean, ayy
What you mean, bitch, tell me what you mean, ayy
What you mean, bitch, tell me what you mean, ayy
Your man crushing putting xannies in your lean

[Verse 1: $teven Cannon]
Chiefing on the smoke, she knows I ain't broke
I don't keep no hoes, I tell them adiós
I look better than your bitch, xan man Fabio
Been finessin' so damn long, I lotta let adió'
Cops swoop, I throw the pills into the dash though
My pornstar put the coke in her asshole
I'm the type to put the lean in the flask, yo
Mom when I'm recording they know rats in the lab though
Juice, juice, pour the lean in the juice
I wouldn’t dare to try that nigga, on my momma that’s the truth
I don't fuck with niggas all these niggas [?]
Xanax in the whip throw your titties out the roof
Your mom look better than your girl doe
Bitches playing on the net I know real hoes
You ain't playing on my court, I own the field though
My xans ain't on the street, they in the hills though

[Hook]
What you mean, bitch, tell me what you mean, ayy
Your man crushing putting xannies in your lean, ayy
I need a bean, tell your friend to come between, ayy
What you mean, bitch, tell me what you mean (ayy ooh)
What you mean, bitch, tell me what you mean, ayy
What you mean, bitch, tell me what you mean, ayy
What you mean, bitch, tell me what you mean, ayy
Your man crushing putting xannies in your lean
