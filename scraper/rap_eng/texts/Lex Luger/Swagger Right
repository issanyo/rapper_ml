[Hook]
I got my swagger right, call me swagger right
I got my swagger right, call me swagger right
I got my swagger right, call me swagger right
I got my swagger right, call me swagger right
Keep grinding, keep grinding
Keep grinding, keep grinding
I'm shining, I'm shining
I'm shining, necklace blinding

[Verse 1]
Nigga snitched on me for two grams of weed
Pussy ass nigga, nowhere near a G
You ain't from Riverdale or CB
I heard shawty flexing, he ain't from MT
Whip designed on it, he ain't Morrow on it
He ain't Fab 5 and he ain't Brick Squad
Got his momma saying: "I'm finna call twelve
And if my son die, I bet you I'll go to jail"
Chaz, chill out, Slim, what's up?
Dae Dae, what it do? J-Mike, me and you
Rolling off a pill, trying to get right
Codeine with the Sprite, got the clique, good night
Straight trees, nigga, blow trees, nigga
O-Z's, nigga, a 550 nigga
That's the cost, I'm a boss
Triple beams, call me Flocka Ross

[Hook]
I got my swagger right, call me swagger right
I got my swagger right, call me swagger right
I got my swagger right, call me swagger right
I got my swagger right, call me swagger right
Keep grinding, keep grinding
Keep grinding, keep grinding
I'm shining, I'm shining
I'm shining, necklace blinding

[Verse 2]
Do this shit my own way, fuck with all the DJs
Make my own leeway, chase my own dreams, bae
Teacher named Gucci, hard work, no play
Signed a record deal, so I gotta chase a mill, bae
Perform like a rock star, used to be a block star
Now I'm dropping records, climbing up the hip-hop charts
The shooter's favorite shooter, the dope man young, nigga
Only two things: don't run and shoot your gun, nigga
Hit Squad Taliban till the day I die
Them boys taught me this, them boys taught me that
Mix it up with Gucci, now I'm balling with the sack
Me and Young Sac pushing party packs

[Hook]
I got my swagger right, call me swagger right
I got my swagger right, call me swagger right
I got my swagger right, call me swagger right
I got my swagger right, call me swagger right
Keep grinding, keep grinding
Keep grinding, keep grinding
I'm shining, I'm shining
I'm shining, necklace blinding

[Outro]
Clayco got that swagger right
Brick Squad got that swagger right
Shawty got that swagger right
My homies got that swagger right
Blood got that swagger right
Piru got that swagger right
West got that swagger right
East got that swagger right
North got that swagger right
South got that swagger right
Got that swagger right, got that swagger right
I got my swagger right, call me swagger right
I got my swagger right, call me swagger right
