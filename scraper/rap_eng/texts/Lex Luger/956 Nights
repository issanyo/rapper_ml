[Intro: Doe Boy]
If Esco don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
You know how we rockin' for young Future man

[Hook: Doe Boy]
I got 56 shots, nigga play with Esco
Choppers start boomin', nigga play with Metro
But nah this ain't no Metro, this a beat by Lex though
FBG the gang, bitch come sign to Death Row

[Verse: Doe Boy]
This ain't gangsta rap, I'm just bringing hood back
Let a savage in the game, I make 'em feel like Suge back
All my niggas shoot straps, sell dog and cook crack
He a pussy with some money so you know we took that
9-1-1, the streets need me
The streets love Beezy 'cause the streets believe me
Bitch my hoe card don't exist
Cross and you gon' meet the stick
Bitch we riding like a Lyft
Wit guns we can barely lift
Bitch I'm flexin', I'm cappin', you lackin', I'm jackin'
I pull out this cannon, demanding, not asking
You rappin', not trapping, I'm savage, you acting
You taxing, they snatching, they pull up, get active
Why these pussies tryna beef, I'm not even in they reach
Got some youngins tryna eat, I'll feed you to the streets
Oh these niggas think it's sweet? where you at, I'm tryna link
Got that draco on the seat, make 'em JuJu on that beat
Hopped in da Audi, shooting then I'm outty
Niggas at my neck but I got all these goons around me
Broke niggas bore me, you can fight this .40
Magazine clip, I'll let it tell a story
Ridin' through the trenches but we pulling up in Porsches
Shooter on the streets but go to jail and get extorted
That's why I don't need the MAC
This the truth, it ain't a rap
Last nigga ran up on me on the Fam, he took a nap
He ain't really 'bout that life that pussy boy just talk that
Fifty thousand 'round my neck, I swear yo life don't cost that
I can't pay that boy attention 'cause he ain't no boss yet
I got niggas that catch bodies they just ain't get caught yet
Hold on

[Hook: Doe Boy]
I got 56 shots, nigga play with Esco
Choppers goin' boomin', nigga play with Metro
But nah this ain't no Metro, this a beat by Lex though
FBG the gang, bitch come sign to Death Row

[Outro: Doe Boy]
Streets need me nigga
Gang gang
Doe!
