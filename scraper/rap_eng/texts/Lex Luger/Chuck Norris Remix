[Chorus]

I don’t know about you
I think I’m Chuck Norris
What the hell you gonna do?
I think I’m Chuck Norris

F. COSTA

[Lyric]

I think I’m Rick Ross, the big boss, Rozay
Waka Flocka Flames and Gucci Mane
Burning reefa like Wiz Khalifa, Taylor Gang
Zan with that lean like Soulja Boy, but I sip it like Little Wayne
Dirty Money, I’m feeling like P. Diddy
And I’ll be running this game like 2Pac and Big dit it
I think I’m Lil B, cooking chicken in the kitchen
I hear they talking shit, but I ain’t listen
I think I’m Snoop Dogg, sipping Gin and Juice
I dont love these hoes, this is the truth
I feel like Dr. Dre, hell yeah, on Dre Day
I think I’m Ludacris, bitch get out the way
I think I’m Florida, driving a lowrider
I write my lyrics, I don’t need a ghost writer
I don’t rhyme so fast like Busta rhymes
But I can break your neck, like Busta Rhymes
I want a 5 star chick, like Yo Gotti
I don’t care about you, I think I’m Chuck Norris
Chuck Norris, I think I’m Chuck Norris

[Chorus]

RUDAH ZION

[Lyric]

I'm like Charmilionaire when them see me rolling
I'm like Jay-Z when I ride with my Beyonce
I'm like Bone Thugs Paper Paper money money
I'm like Nas & Damian Marley smoking in the bong
Thank God is Friday Night
I'm like Ice Cube
Google me bitch
Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It
I'm like Eminem I'm a Motha Focka Slim Shady
Loosing my self my name is what  I'm not afraid
I'm like Game when I dream
So Lets ride
I'm like Meth & Redman so Lets get
I'm like Outlawz smoke all 2Pac ashes
I'm like Fat Joe & Drake I'm half black
I'm like Evidence solitary same folk
Bury me Alive I loose my mind like Young Buck
Like Trick Daddy Outkast in the Nelly Ville
Slow motion for me bitch I'm Juvenille
I think I'm like a Morpheus like a new and all the crew
I'm think I'm Chuck Norris from Brazil keeping the real

[Chorus]
