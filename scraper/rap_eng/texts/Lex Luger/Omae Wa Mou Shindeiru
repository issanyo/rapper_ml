[Intro]
Before I sell this dope, I gotta smoke some
Before I fuck your bitch, I gotta roll some
Before these hoes start talking, I expose 'em
Yung 9C the demon
Spit the flame and roast 'em, toast 'em

[Verse]
Diamonds, they wet like a pussy, aye
I put some weed in my cookie, aye
Smokin' this dope to the face and it's killing my brain
It's probably mushy, aye
I am a vet, you a rookie, damn
You had a chain but I took it, damn
Now I be pimping these bitches and flexing on rappers
I used to be bullied (Let's go, bitch!)

Throw that ass back
Throw it back
I love ratchet bitches
I do not fuck with lame hoes
I must keep my distance
Go two hundred percent 'cause a hundred is not enough
Spent two hundred bucks on some bud
Put it in the trunk

Diamonds wet just like a shark
Shades are very dark
I got money in my pocket like I'm Tony Stark
Take your bitch and break her heart
Boy, don't even start
Run up on me, you get hit up by a fucking dart

Omae Wa Shindeiru
Omae, Omae Wa Shindeiru
I pull up like "who are you?"
I pull up, I'm like "who are you?"
I'm balling out of control
Look at my dro
Haters out of my scope
Run up a check on a hoe
Stack up my dough
Sippin' on lean in the coke

Young boy
Hit him in the body
Put a bullet hole in your Maserati
Smoking dope
Imma hit the sky
I'm too high, but I'm not a pilot

Fuck hoes
Don't give a fuck about 'em
You ain't a G
You don't hang around 'em
[?] foreign put a chain around it
And it freeze up like a glacier 'round it

I'm smoking on that purp
Sipping on that purp (lean)
And I came in this bitch
High as shit like Captain Kirk
You running up, you get murked
Your face stuck in the dirt
And all I care about is money
I been putting in work
This chain full of them blue stones
I fuck hoes
I got hella bones
Ride around on my side of town
Got codeine in my styrofoam
Ease the pain
Gang shit, bitch
I got purp mixed in my Sprite drink
I dividend 'cause I'm flipping bands
Despite what a boy might think

If it's not about the fucking money I'm not interested
Rolling up my dope
I be thumbing through my Benjamins
Charlie Sheen
I got tiger blood in my bloodstream
I got hoes that shave
I like the pussy bald like Mr. Clean

Kirby Super Star
I'm a super star
When I hit your girl
Might be super hard
I got yellow Xans
I call them super bars
'Cause when I pop them I am so high
I am super far

I whip my dick out and take a piss on your coupe
Fuck your car
Flick the glass on your Lambo
I cut my wrist with the shards
Sora Su came with the blade
It's big as all of my woods
Run it up
I run it up
I keep it G in my hood
And that bitch you fell in love with, she just sucked my dick
She told me keep a filter on my words
I'm not with that shit
It's the return of the pimp
My blunt feel like a blimp
I chase money
You chase bitches
I'm that G, you a simp, lil bitch
