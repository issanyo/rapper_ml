[Hook 2x: Snap “The Writer”]
Praying to Jesus Christ is the right kind of nice (2x)
Praying to Jesus Christ
Pa pa praying to Jesus Christ (2x)
Is the right kind of nice

[1st Verse: Snap “The Writer”]
I’m doing heavenly things
I am a heavenly being
I’m doing heavenly things
While I am heavenly seeking
Through the Holy Bible for support
While I’m giving thanks to the Lord
Crank or put this one on record
If you feel what I feel accord
Ding too how Jesus send his graces upond us
I’m fresh as an ice box or the breath that a orthodontist breath
My Lord and savior forgive me please
For the ether I spat on beats
When I thought that I was a beast

[Hook 2x: Snap “The Writer”]
Praying to Jesus Christ is the right kind of nice (2x)
Praying to Jesus Christ
Pa pa praying to Jesus Christ (2x)
Is the right kind of nice

[2nd Verse: Snap “The Writer”]
I will praise the Lord as long as I live
I praise em long as I’m his
Believe that he brings that gift
Of joy right back to that kid
He saves me from the mouth of the lion
Cause without him I am dying
My Lord and savior is eying
The whole universe
That is a reason why I use a verse
To get back with em
Just like a person wearing his emblem
And that’s the cross
Believe that I’ll easily get involved
In holy churches where they really take Jesus Christ as the boss

[Hook 2x: Snap “The Writer”]
Praying to Jesus Christ is the right kind of nice (2x)
Praying to Jesus Christ
Pa pa praying to Jesus Christ (2x)
Is the right kind of nice

[3rd Verse: ML Trey]
Every morning I wake up I thank the Lord that I’m breathing
Say your prayer and thank em
The blessings I’ve been receiving
Keep the bible in hand because the devil’s very deceiving
Praying to Jesus Christ to get rid of these evil demons
Not here to judge I’m here to teach you a lesson
Hopefully when I die get to meet the teacher of Heaven
My heart is clear of evil won’t let the Devil pursue me
No need to worry clearly Jehovah is talking to me

[Hook 2x: Snap The Writer]
Praying to Jesus Christ is the right kind of nice (2x)
Praying to Jesus Christ
Pa pa praying to Jesus Christ (2x)
Is the right kind of nice
