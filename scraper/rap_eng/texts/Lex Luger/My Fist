[Intro]
I step off in the club, I'm in the club
I'm in the club
Swish
(Six rings, cuz
Six rings, cuz
Six)

[Hook]
I step off in the club, man, I'm balling like a ballplayer
Six rings on and my house is like a mall, player
Championship-sized rings sitting on my fist
Championship-sized rings sitting on my fist
I step off in the club, man, I'm balling like a ballplayer
Six rings on and my house is like a mall, player
Championship-sized rings sitting on my fist
Championship-sized rings sitting on my fist

[Verse 1]
I got six rings on and my team strong
Swagging down the court and I'm blowing on that strong
And I'm swishing like a net 'cause my check be straight-up blowing
With these VVS diamonds like a NBA plug
With these big red diamonds like some droplets of human blood
This Young Juiceman and I got it out the mud
And my pockets hold them racks, two hundred thousand, I'm [?] bud
With them racks, just call them Shaq and your money like Spud

[Hook]
I step off in the club, man, I'm balling like a ballplayer
Six rings on and my house is like a mall, player
Championship-sized rings sitting on my fist
Championship-sized rings sitting on my fist
I step off in the club, man, I'm balling like a ballplayer
Six rings on and my house is like a mall, player
Championship-sized rings sitting on my fist
Championship-sized rings sitting on my fist

[Verse 2]
I step off in the club like a lightbulb
Swishing like a net and I'm high just like a bug
Your hoe is like a tick 'cause she hunting for a Blood
And I'm stupid guacamole, so she wet just like a tub
With all these rings on me and I need a extra thumb
All about them green guys, you can call me Uncle Tom
With my house just like a mall and and them bricks, I get them gone
Ooh, it's halftime, so I'm working on my phone

[Hook]
I step off in the club, man, I'm balling like a ballplayer
Six rings on and my house is like a mall, player
Championship-sized rings sitting on my fist
Championship-sized rings sitting on my fist
I step off in the club, man, I'm balling like a ballplayer
Six rings on and my house is like a mall, player
Championship-sized rings sitting on my fist
Championship-sized rings sitting on my fist
