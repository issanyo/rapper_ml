[Hook]
I'm on a money makin' mission
(money making mission)
I'm on a money makin' mission
(money making mission)
I'm on a money makin' mission
(money making mission)
I'm on a money makin' mission
(money making mission)
I'm on a money makin' mission
And I'm icy, snow cone, and she like me, who don’t

[Verse 1]
You been selling dope since ’96, you still ain't got a brick
You might just need to quit, or slit your wrist
So you know that I’m back bitch, I just left Saks Fifth
I could make that pussy backflip, I could make that pussy backflip, I stay with two hoes, Jack trip (I stay with two hoes, Jack trip) and They say three is a company and four is a crowd
But not if you wanna the illest realest niggas around
And the way that I'm feeling its like the ceilings my ground
And when I was selling the white you was smokin' on brown

[Hook]
I'm on a money makin' mission
(money making mission)
I'm on a money makin' mission
(money making mission)
I'm on a money makin' mission
(money making mission)
I'm on a money makin' mission
(money making mission)
I'm on a money makin' mission
And I'm icy, snow cone, and she like me, who don’t
