[Hook]
Meet me at my hotel
Don’t tell nobody, no
Meet me at my hotel
Girl I gotta watch my back
‘Cause I’m not just anybody
Hotel
Nobody gotta know
Meet me at my hotel
Girl I gotta watch my back
‘Cause I’m not just anybody

[Verse 1]
Back on road, creepin’ on the low
Here we go again
After show, just knock on the door
I’m on go and shit
Privacy, then I gotta leave
I can’t pose miss
Tip the valet like skkrt
Just might uber [?] for dope dick
[?] fit these dubs baby
You won’t find love in club baby
But I be the one that you run and call
When you want the drugs and fuck baby
Text you the number, get in the car
I came through the lobby, you know who I are
Don’t keep me waiting, you can’t be that far, baby
I been grinding
Now we unwinding
She on the floor ‘cause she on the wine and
She dutty wining
She out of control
Just another room, another pair of panties on the floor again
They call my room
They say they smell smoke

[Hook]
Meet me at my hotel
Don’t tell nobody, no
Meet me at my hotel
Girl I gotta watch my back
‘Cause I’m not just anybody
Hotel
Nobody gotta know
Meet me at my hotel
Girl I gotta watch my back
‘Cause I’m not just anybody

[Outro]
Back on road, creepin’ on the low
Here we go again
After show, just knock on the door
I’m on go and shit
Privacy, then I gotta leave
I can’t pose miss
