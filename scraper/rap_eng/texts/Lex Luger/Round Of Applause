[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Let me see you, bust it, bust it
Baby drop it to the floor and bust it, bust it (Drop it down and just)

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bounce that ass, shake that ass like the Twerk Team
Hair long, ass fat, shawty mean
That girl look like Halle Berry when I'm on them beans
When I hit the scene girls yelling and they scream
"Flocka can you be my baby daddy?" (Yes!)
Pimping like I'm Dolemite, hoes jump in my Caddy
Smoke like I got cataract in the strip club throwing up them stacks
Got racks on top of racks
Bust that pussy, make that ass clap, clap, clap
I ain't done with you, baby bring that ass back
Still got 20's, still got 50's, even got them hundreds
Throw some money, throw some money I'mma let it go
Waka Flocka Flame, better known as Mr. Let It Go

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Let me see you, bust it, bust it
Baby drop it to the floor and bust it, bust it (Drop it down and just)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Bust it like you can't afford a car
You a star, you look in the mirror, you know who you are, right?
Cool, take it low, take it way lower than that
I fly private when I go, ain't no layover on that
Yeah I made it to the top, took a seat, still sitting man
I'm up in Stadium in D.C. still tipping man
She coulda paid tuition five times, still stripping
I just throw a couple bills, and she'll have a pair of heels
Oh no, there I go, magic tricking on your ass
Throwing every president except for Nixon on your ass
Make you rich, I feel like I should make commission on your ass
Wonder what you would ever do if I went missing on your ass

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Let me see you, bust it, bust it
Baby drop it to the floor and bust it, bust it (Drop it down and just)

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Throwin' them stacks, OMG
SMH when I'm on that stage
Pourin' Rose all on her ass, a round of appeal baby pop that pussy
Drop it down for me girl do a split, do you smoke girl? Gotta zip
White RÃ©my Martin, who wanna sip? 45 on my hip
But I gain one deep and every word I say is slurrin'
Vision, man is blurrin', drunk too much liquor
Smoke too much weed, bitch I'm on too much E
I'm so high, y'all will miss me
In love with strip clubs, shorty I'm a big tipper
Two hundred then I pull down my zipper, ughh
Shawty say she want me and she wanna meet my crew, Squad
Niggas know we go hard, Squad

[Alt. Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bounce that ass, shake that ass like the Twerk Team
Bust it, bust it, like the Twerk Team
Bust it, bust it, like the twerk team
Bricksquad monopoly, shorty that's my home team
All the smokers they gangsta green, can't do no G talk
I need a classy girl in the bed, she ain't gotta be a freak ho
Bust it, bust it, lay down on that floor girl
Bust it, bust it, give me some more head girl

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Round of applause baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor make that ass clap
Round of applause baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor make that ass clap
Let me see you
Bust it Bust it Bust it
Bust it Bust it Bust it
Baby drop it to the floor
And
Bust it Bust it Bust it
Bust it Bust it Bust it
