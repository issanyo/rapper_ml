[Hook] x3
I should'a played for the Raiders, I should'a played for the Hawks
I should'a played for the Raiders, I should'a played for the Hawks
I should'a played for the Raiders, I should'a played for the Hawks
Cause I'm ballin', but I'm in the backseat

[RiFF RAFF]
I grab heat, I'm Dwayne Wade
I'm candy Hummer high school, LeBron James
Them black 500's with shades, The taper fade
I should'a won a Grammy for my freshest braids
My lemonade is sprayed with the codeine
I did a lot of drugs, but I'm not a dope fiend
Maybe I am,I'm flipping candy yams
Pontiac Trans Am, my wrist Toucan Sam
Polyester suit, my coupe minus the roof
I'm Sheryl Swoopes, Ballin', Babe Ruth
I'm hooping stratosphere, Bill Laimbeer
RiFF RAFF, Lex Luger, we outta here
