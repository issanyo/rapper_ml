[Hook]
Sometime's it's just like Romeo and Juliet, got it out the boat yeah

Money stack can't fold yeah, money stack can't fold
Just like Romeo and Juliet, got it out the boat yeah
We can't die alone yeah, love is all we know yeah
We gon' work the stove yeah, she gon' work the pole yeah
Money stack can't fold yeah, money stack can't fold yeah
How you doing, how you doing, nice to meet you
Lil bro keep that tool whenever I might greet you
How you doing, how you doing, nice to meet you
I keep that .30 tucked whenever I might meet you

[Verse 1]
I just hit a stain, took his chain, in the rain
If a goofy want the pain, big bro .30 to his brain
K, on the way, only good gas what I bake
Eat that bitch like steak, I don't understand why they hate
Lame nigga, stain nigga, you not what you claim nigga
Gosha on my sleeve and my teeth by Johnny Dang nigga
Bang nigga, bang nigga, no I do not bang nigga
But I hang with the gang boy, boy you just a lame boy
Salute, salute, all of my shooters they shoot
You know that I got the proof, I skeet your hoe in the coupe
Salute, salute, all of my shooters they shoot
I pour a four in the juice, I pour a four in the juice
Salute, salute, all of my shooters they shoot
You know that I got the proof, I skeet your hoe in the coupe
Salute, salute, all of my shooters they shoot
I pour a four in the juice, I pour a four in the juice
Bitches on me heavy, Beamer hold that Chevy
Fuck that bitch she petty, them boys just ain't ready
Red like sauce, spaghetti, oh my god she wealthy
In the cut, I'm stealthy, I'm so hot like melted
I done ran off with your sack, you can't get it back
All I know is tax, all I speak is facts
Fendi on my bag, your bitch smoke that crack
Lips all on my sack, press you like the Mac
Richer than Richie, I might drop 50
TEC in my Dickies, gas in my Swisher
Richer than Richie, I might drop 50
TEC in my Dickies, gas in my Swisher

[Outro]
Salute, salute, all of my shooters they shoot
You know that I got the proof, I skeet your hoe in the coupe
Salute, salute, all of my shooters they shoot
I pour a four in the juice, I pour a four in the juice
