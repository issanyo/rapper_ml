[Verse 1]
Another flight, another highlight
Fuck what you talkin’
Sacrificed everything, got my grind right
Like so every often
I stuck a Sprite, it tastes like the limelight, hey
Had to go through this shit to get my mind right, hey
I take a trip over ocean
I done caught me a wave, I’m coasting
Like what do you want from me
Nigga you want me to teach you the hustle
Nigga I got my own family to feed
Lot of shit do not matter to me
I ain’t sharing one gram of weed
Ain’t no sharing no jewels, we eating
Block a bitch down, she come home to me
[?] niggas really hate it, I see it
His baby mama wants this wave right now
Million dollar nigga fucking a diva
I used to love and trust ‘til you showed me that it’s nothing
Said I used to love and trust ‘til you showed me that it’s nothing

[Interlude]
Sittin’ back
Rollin’ one
To the stars
Nigga I deserve to ball
Takeover

[Verse 2]
Say that money when you say my name
All this faith even with the fate
I said I would, niggas swore I ain’t shit
I deserve to blow a little change
Man this lifestyle make a lot change
Sell a bill, buy a couple chains
I’ll never forget all the fucking pain
Nah I’ll never forget all them fucking days
Niggas tried to treat me like a fucking lame
I done fell in love with progression
I just want what is owed to me, no I don’t want nothin’ extra
Hop out the coupe and I’m flexing
She follow me to my section
Told me no, she don’t need nothing special
She just want to have sex and my necklace, bless it
Everything manifested
These niggas second guessing, I can see it
Hoes want this wave right now
Groupie bitches walkin’ ‘round like some divas
I used to love and trust ‘til you showed me that it’s nothing
Said I used to love and trust ‘til you showed me that it’s nothing

[Outro]
Walk in this bitch and I spend every dollar on it
Spend that shit nigga
Takeoverrr
