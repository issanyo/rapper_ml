[Verse 1]
Smoked out, just boarded my flight
TSA all in my face in line
I smell like gas and a bag every time
Even when I’m up, my nigga I’ma grind
When I’m down niggas can’t tell ‘cause I shine
Went out my way, made sure I got mine
Plate getting scraped, only thing on my mind my nigga
Got richer, got smarter, got flyer, got better my nigga
Fuck bitches, fuck niggas, go and get your cheddar my nigga
If they gettin’ it, don’t trip, get yours, it’s levels my nigga
I said I’m done with the evils for good and I know that the devil gon’ miss me
A nigga worth something, can’t risk it
You tryna hurt something, that’s iffy
A nigga murk something ‘bout this shit
Still comfortable in my city
Every time I burn something, thank god ‘cause he with me
When I’m in the hills, don’t get no service
When niggas tryna hit me, work to get busy

[Hook]
Look at my whip, look at my bitch
Look at my fit, look at my clique
Look at this shit, look at the jewels
Look at the view, nigga this shit sick
This came from working nigga
Nobody gave me shit, this came from working nigga
You better get yours too
Look at my whip, look at my bitch
Look at my fit, look at my clique
Look at this shit, look at the jewels
Look at the view, nigga this shit sick
This came from working nigga
Nobody gave me shit, this came from working nigga
You better get yours too

[Verse 2]
Started getting paid, been geeked ever since
Stacking my change, I ain’t tryna buy shit
Fuck getting laid, nigga tryna ride Benz
Happy or rich, damn why I gotta pick?
Little D’usse when I’m with a nigga’s bitch
She love this song, nigga this her shit
I love them walls, nigga her shit grip
From where the niggas my age either on t-shirts
Or they upstate stretched on beds
Gotta stay down on the way down
Shit take time when a young nigga blessed like this
Young nigga flex like this
Say one word, bitches wanna have sex like this
Grind with the best I did
Niggas getting checks in the e-mail and text message
Taylor and Lex the shit
Niggas still mad, I’m high, I ain’t pressed for shit
Think I’m ‘bout one, backends
Up all night getting right, getting these tracks in
Working, this shit don’t stop
Worried ‘bout me, better get you a pound or a block
Nigga like me can’t watch
Nigga like me need it off top

[Hook]
Look at my whip, look at my bitch
Look at my fit, look at my clique
Look at this shit, look at the jewels
Look at the view, nigga this shit sick
This came from working nigga
Nobody gave me shit, this came from working nigga
You better get yours too
Look at my whip, look at my bitch
Look at my fit, look at my clique
Look at this shit, look at the jewels
Look at the view, nigga this shit sick
This came from working nigga
Nobody gave me shit, this came from working nigga
You better get yours too
