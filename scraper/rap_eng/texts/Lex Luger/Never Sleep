[Hook]
I'm on the grind, I never sleep
You niggas on a diet, you never eat
I'm on the grind, I never sleep
You niggas on a diet, you never eat
You niggas never eat
You niggas never eat
Nigga is you on a diet? You never eat
I'm on the grind, I never sleep
You niggas on a diet, you never eat

[Verse 1: Young Lace]
I got that money in my pocket
Got that money on my phone
I got a chick sittin' at home
And she don’t like to be alone
Daddy gotta go like some dice I gotta roll
Gotta keep that money coming like some pussy on the show
And a nigga undisputed, you know that I eluded my competition
And now when niggas they gettin' recruited
And they want my John Hancock up on the dotted line
But I'm like "fuck the mainsteam," I got a pocket full of dimes
Can't a nigga tell a nigga shit about himself?
And I ain’t talking no 13 I got that Louis on my belt
Shout out to my niggas that's sittin' behind the wall
Tryna got a package, letter, or a three-way call (what up?)
Baby mama drama, no visitation on weekends
Trippin' bout the latest baby mama s'posed to sneak in
I know that I'm flyer than the next man
Flyer than your current, your best and your ex-man

[Hook]

[Verse 2: KTB]
Bitch I can’t sleep, but it ain't kid got me inside me
But you know about that, gettin' money in the the traps
And the weed by the side, don't lie
But I pack (Heim?)
Big Red up on my belt, they think is Christmas
Gucci on my waist, gotta wear that Louis just to diss us
Take a hit of that blunt, my top just rise like a dinner roll
Used to fuck with ratchet bitches, now I'm fucking centerfolds
Hey nigga that's real shit
Mine is on kill switch, I just eat them niggas for dinner, ho
Why don't yo nigga go ahead up on this beat?
Kill a cam up on this beat
Someone text a jam up on this beat, nigga
See these other rappers is cowards
My Nina play the fat five, my nigga Jawan(sic) Howard
Like the white I got that (?) Benjamin showers me
We got your bitches knock them down like Twin Towers
Smokin' so much vision's clouded, hella trees they won't allow it
You say that you gettin' money, my niggas say that we doubt it
