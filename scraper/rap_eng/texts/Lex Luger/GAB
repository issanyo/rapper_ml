Coop White But its a purple seater; Hit his ass with bout 30 meters; You niggas sweet like margaritas;
With my Jason Mask; Hide em in the bleachers; Its Yung Zu; and we get it poppin' mention Treasure Money;
And the hoes flawkin'; 40 cal. with a mop; had to clean his brains with a mop; Said it Ain't no thang;
Way we play the game gotta small circle like 360; Bought a pound then I broke it down; the way I twist it up;
It smoke like chimneys; Closed mouths don't get fed that's why im open hands; Like bitch gimme; You come fast;
And ill blow yo ass; If you come for mine you can feel the semi; I was raised not to fear a man; Since time began;
Not a bitch In me; You niggas sweet like Peter Pan; Quick to snitch and shit Hit The Fan; Ice cold Like Poltergeist;
Smoking loud pack straight Northern Lights; Cops come I don't stop for nothing; I ain't talking trains when I say im busting;
Thought you was; when you really wasn't; got Big guns with clips for dozens; Bury me in a gold casket imma cow boy til my souls passing;
You a lame and that's so drastic; Shoot his ass like Oh what Happened? ; Lil nigga don't want war cause ill die for mine like roman catholics; its Yung Zu;
