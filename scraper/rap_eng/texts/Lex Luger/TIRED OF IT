[Chorus: Flat Affect]
Oh we got cold souls
Come bring that lighter make em burn
We try to uplift
If you ain't with it you will learn
Lot of fucked up
Sadistic people in this world
Sometimes its hard to cope
But in the end we make it work
Man I’m tired of it
If you don't like us speak your words
Cause man I'm tired of it
I swear that most of you the worst
I did all kinds of shit
Time to repent, for good I yearn
At least I’m trying shit
While you're too cucked to use your words

[Post-Chorus]
Cold souls
Come bring that lighter make em burn
We got cold souls
Come bring that lighter make em burn
We got cold souls
Come bring that lighter make em burn
We got cold souls
Come bring that lighter make em burn

[Verse 1: Flat Affect]
Man i got absent eyes
You all have seen it
Swear ain't my fault
I watched some family die
Pain in my heart, scream at the walls
Got thoughts on homocide
I got a shrink, but she's the worst
I see my mother cry
I swear that makes me feel the worst
But I been goin hard
Trying so long to make it work
And now I'm bout to shine
I really want this fucking world
Oh your life's so hard?
Tell me about it, ok word
I hardly give a shit
Got my own problems you got yours

[Chorus: Flat Affect & BRUHMANEGOD]
Oh we got cold souls
Come bring that lighter make em burn
We try to uplift
If you ain't with it you will learn
Lot of fucked up
Sadistic people in this world
Sometimes its hard to cope
But in the end we make it work
Man I'm tired of it
If you don’t like us speak your words
Cause man I’m tired of it
I swear that most of you the worst
I did all kinds of shit
Time to repent, for good I yearn
At least I'm trying shit
While you’re too cucked to use your words

[Verse 2: BRUHMANEGOD]
We the lifeline
You better get down on your nubs you fucking parasite
It's like you're tryna die
Enraged and aged quick
So tired of satan im
Further impatient on the daily, i ain caving in
Dead soul adrift and scattered with the everything
It's simple
You think what’s out there gives a fuck about a people
We peddle everything for dust and so we out of luck
If you ain't hearin, piss away but don't come cryn to me
I told you once you shouldn't waste that should be all it takes
Go head and make your last mistakes it's fuckin judgment day
You can't jus give back what you took y'all bouta die today
Yamudaa holiday les celebrate
