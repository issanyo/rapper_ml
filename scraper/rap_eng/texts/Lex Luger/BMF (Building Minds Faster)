[Lupe: Talking]
Uh huh, friend of the People
Yeah, I mean c'mon
What the fuck do I gotta do
This one for the fans here Jack

[Refrain]
I think I'm Malcom X, Martin Luther
Add a King, add a Junior
Some Bible verses, couple Sunnahs
An AK-47 that's a revolution, nigga
Think I'm 2Pac, Bob Marley
Fela Kuti, Marcus Garvey
Them the real ones, light a lighter for 'em
Letcha know, that I'm ridin' for 'em

[Verse 1]
Gon' gimme some, a lil' more beat
Call your friends around, then call the police
I'm ridin' with my flow, it take up four seats
So I'm gon' ghost ride but with no sheets
One man by myself, even then I'm four-deep
Like hotel swimming pools, that's four feet
These niggas like the rooms, so suite
Priceline, so cheap
I'm the cell phone, they the room keys
I'm some shell toes, they some shoe strings
I turn 'em off, I take 'em out
I'm Reverend Run, with the laces out
Adidas, so adios
All day I dream, like I'm comatose
That's your ship sinking, and I'm so afloat
I'm T-Pain, I'm on a boat
Not the slave one, DiCaprio's either
Hear the waves come, they started in the bleachers
So I'm swag surfin', the pool's getting deeper
You still sweet though, here come them room keepers
Ok I'll be the strings, you be the shoes
But guess what, now they Jimmy Choo's
I wear the pants, you Winnie Poohs
Yo shit meows, my shit awoo
I got a fifth flow, call me Brother Man
Africa the set, yea that's the motherland
For that BP, I shed fifty tears
In Nigeria that oil been spillin' for like fifty years
Fifty years? Hell naww
Hell yeah, I'm tryna tell ya'll
At this rate, niggas gon' lose
Can't search for water, or grow your own food
Tell me what's gon' happen, when them stores close
And ain't gon open up, no more
Yeah that's the realest shit
You gon' feel that, hunger's your enemy
But you can't kill that
Nigga wake up, don't join the army
Kill your own peoples, but fear
Illuminatis and they ain't even real, or are they
But you ain't even know, because you par-tay
Too fuckin' much, if you start to doubt
They already in yo mind, and comin' out yo mouth
Its not a trick, nigga, it's a trap
Survival of the fit, is what they aiming at
And niggas ain't fit, fat as hell
Fat in mind, body fat, as well
Who use most the drugs? Americans
What's in Afghanistan? Heroin
You think that's by mistake? They can't stop that
Don't think you safe though, because you not black
Greed is colorblind, so I'm colorblind
They gon' fuck with yours soon as they done with mine
They say I try to hard, verses overwhelm
I learned most of this, from niggas sittin' in jail
Where you think I'm from? I'm from the streets nigga
Triple OG's told me to teach nigga
And that ain't made up, nope, that's a fact
They say that gangsta shit is the shit I rap
Look who I attract, look at my inner circle
Bunch of street niggas, and a couple Urkels
Look at my fanbase, oh yes
Fuck what Pro say, look at this protest
Where they do that at? Who they do that for?
Must mean I'm doin' bad, and things is movin' slow
We talkin' revolution on public radio
Then catch me down in Houston, sittin on them 84s
Trae, wassup? ABN
Gotcha back nigga, sink or swim
Free Chilly Chill, shake off your masters
Pray to God, build your mind faster

[Hook]
I think I'm Malcolm X, Martin Luther
Add a King, add a Junior
Couple Bible verses, and some Sunnahs
An AK-47, that's a revolution (nigga)
Think I'm 2Pac, Bob Marley
Fela Kuti, Marcus Garvey
Them the real ones, light a lighter for 'em
If you ain't know, I'm ridin' for 'em
