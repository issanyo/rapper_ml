[Hook x2]
Mane I get so much money
Mane I get so much money
A nigga like me don't give a fuck about a price
Mane I get so much money
Mane I get so much money
I gotta a P. Diddy swag, and a Hugh Hefner life

[Verse 1]
Man I get so much money, love a bunch of snow bunnies
Take em to the crib, get em in the pool and then fuck em
Take them bitches gamblin', and do some shit that Hammer did
And go and blow a hundred racks and it were from no gamblin'
Foreign cars, push-buttons, anything to keep me stuntin'
Foreign chicks are freaky sumthin, pull it out she start suckin
Bitch I got the best weed, Cali keep me puffin'
And I do alot of drugs, just like David Ruffin

[Hook x2]
Mane I get so much money
Mane I get so much money
A nigga like me don't give a fuck about a price
Mane I get so much money
Mane I get so much money
I gotta a P. Diddy swag, and a Hugh Hefner life

[Verse 2]
Man I get so much money, I ball like the NBA
But I don't run down the court, I be on a paper chase
Heard they got a brand new Lamb', I'm gon' flip that shit today
I'm gon' find miss Halle Berry, Flip dat bitch like Eric Benet
15 racks, 20 stacks, in the strip I got to waste, money
Cause I can bitch, just for all you niggas hatin'
I love them stripper hoes, pretty smiles all races
And I would love to nut in any one of them hoes faces

[Hook]
Mane I get so much money
Mane I get so much money
A nigga like me don't give a fuck about a price
Mane I get so much money
Mane I get so much money
I gotta a P. Diddy swag, and a Hugh Hefner life
