[Intro: Tootie Ro]
Before the Rap
Ro
These Niggas can't fuck with my plug (Nah)
Told me if I keep it up he'll show love

[Hook: Tootie Ro]
These niggas can't fuck with my plug (Nah)
Try to rob, get bust with my plug (Bop, bop, bop, bop)
You can't say the wrong stuff to my plug (Huh?)
Told me if I keep it up he'll show love (Love)
My plug (My plug)
With my plug (With my plug)
These niggas can't fuck with my plug (Nah)
My plug (My plug)
With my plug (With my plug)
Told me if I keep it up he'll show love

[Verse 1: Tootie Ro]
These niggas can't cop from my plug (Nah)
I got hitters on on the block with my drugs (Old money)
Niggas always come short I just show love (What?)
Throw out G's on the dope just to build buzz (Where we at)
But that was back then I'm talking bout now (Bout now)
Mommy said if ain't Vic then watch who you around
Lot a shit been going on but I'm with whatever (Whatever)
I love my hood
I hug the block just like a sweater (We [?] ready)
Can't wait til we get closer I can cop a leather
Two niggas, two Glocks, we will rob the devil
My trap house hotter than Zig Zags
I be with the shotta's like Jamaicans (Bop bop)
