She dancing like she fucking, she dancing like she fucking
The way lil mama dancing you would swear lil mama fucking
She dancing like she fucking, she dancing like she fucking
The way lil mama dancing you would swear lil mama fucking, let’s go
Show me how you throw it back, show me how you ride it
Shawty pop that pussy like that mane was inside it
Show me how you throw it back, show me how you ride it
Shawty pop that pussy like that mane was inside it

[Verse 1]
Oh shit, this nigga Juicy funny
He walked up in this club with bout 3 or 4 bunnies from the 90210
Boss shit, straight stunting
I was throwing out ones, but this nigga throwing hundreds
Pockets so overweight cause cake on my dinner plate
Got bitches going ham, I flip them like real estate
Keep clapping it for me, dollars stuck to your cheeks
Rolling on ecstasy, mane I done reached reach my peak
Bombay in lemonade, drink of a stunner, bro
Rosé is popular, but I drink what I wanna, bruh
Richer than Uncle Sam, higher than Amsterdam
VIP full of strippers, block niggas like they fam
It’s ridiculous how she drop it into a split
Took her Corona bottle and show me her magic trip
That abracadabra shit, she grabbing all on my dick
She opening up her mouth, I think it’s a perfect fit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She pop that pussy on me, she don’t got no panties on
And I’m drunk as fuck god damn I’m bout to take her home
Lil mama throw that ass like a majorette baton
I love these white girls but I’m not an uncle tom
Know we about to fuck so it ain’t no need to speak
I like it standing up, bend over and touch your feet
No I don’t know this bitch, all I know she a freak
Dick sucking marathon, her and her friend compete
I’m fucking 2 bitches, it ain’t one but of me
How slutty is these hoes, boy I'm about to see
One of them is finna suck, one of them finna eat
Makin easy money pimpin hoes its still Tennessee
