[Verse 1: Cartel MGM]
I'ma give it to you, mami, let me sell another brick
From the southside, so I'm on some gangsta shit
A gangsta-ass nigga needs a gangsta-ass bitch
Gucci, Louis, Prada, I'ma buy you all that shit
I let her hold my strap and I make a good gram
Help me count money, you can keep a couple grand
You ain't never met a guy with this much steelo
Be the first guy to show you how to cook a kilo

[Verse 2: Chaise]
I see you on some gangsta shit and yeah, I could fuck with it
You see who I'm rolling with, some down-ass Georgia chicks
And no, we don't care if you're chilling on the corner, we say no
We don't care if you're floating in the Lambo, we say go
In order to get it,  [?] and you got to keep it tight
You got to commit me, but you know that I'm not [?]
Ask my girls, I'm not just any girl, a fly girl
Yep, I'm a Zay girl
