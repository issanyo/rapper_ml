[ my part ]
Verse: B-a-r to the motherfuckin z
Its the lyricist you hearin this you cannot fuck with me 
Dawg I got my own steez y'all feedin off my energy
Enemies-- steady clockin bitch y'all look like fans to me 
Im the shit I'm on top my nig --tell me when it registers 
The same ones that were slump suddenly blowin up my cellular 
I can't stoop to y'all level , never catch me being regular 
Y'all may get tight from my girl but just know you never checking her
I ain't have lunch yet so this beat im gonna fuckin eat
And if you talkin out yo neck ill leave your head across the street
Should I repeat i think its clear that i am in my fuckin bag
I think its sad that people tweet a life they know they do not have
And I just laugh I end up weak 
In highschool these people peaked 
They can't compete where they dont compare
Just know im not going anywhere
B-a-r to the motherfuckin z
Its the lyricist you hearin this you cannot fuck with me

Verse : got jala lookin bad in the passenger...
Ima kill her box no massacre 
Nut shit be the questions y'all askin her 
Dont matter like a car I keep gassin her
Pockets be leanin I'm coolin and stackin 
I don't need a .40 to never be lackin 
I'm movin smooth like my name Michael jackson
I am the shit , the latest attraction
