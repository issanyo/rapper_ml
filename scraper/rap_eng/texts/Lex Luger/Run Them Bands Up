Okay

[Hook]
Every day I wake up, gotta answer my phone
6 cellphones, call me Get It On Jones
Bust a 36, 12 hundred for a zone
Gold mouth dog, I'm just looking for a bone
Run them bands up, run them, run them bands up (2x)
Getcha grams up, getcha, getcha grams up (2x)

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning then I washed my damn face
Give a thank to God, helped me see another day
He still with a nigga, helped me avoid a drug case
Bailed on 12, he tried to spray me with some mace
Running down the Crest, I led him on a foot chase
Cut through the Valley, young Juiceman, he got away
Early next day, same spot selling yay
Fuck what you heard dog, I'm tryna get paid

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Got them grams up then I ran them bands up
Fresh out the shower, hundred dollar haircut
Then I hit the Crest to go run them plays up
Hundred to one thousand, niggas can't play us
Been in the hood, Sun Valley raised us
Texaco 'til the bus stop paid us
All day trapper, all the J's love us
12 can't stand us but they can't bust us

[Hook]

[Outro]
Trap-A-Holics, real trap shit
Know we trapped out like a 9 to 5 nigga
Chyeah, 32 Entertainment
Chyeah...
