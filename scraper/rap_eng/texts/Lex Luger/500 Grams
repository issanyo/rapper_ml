Bitch fall back my chevy all black
Best believe im about bag of chips and all that

(verse 1)
I said these bitches on my head like a fitted holmes
And these bitches give me head then get headed home
I keep em sleeping on my bed but I sleep alone
Said these pill get you dead get you dead and gone

Did you pay for that? I know she didn't
Got the devil on my back bitch im hell driven
God in my heart smoking Ls in hells kitchen
Rich got the weed workin at the post hilton
Jim morrison Kurt cobain
My bitches real skinny they sniff cocaine
Please listen to me they momma complain
Like im just tellin them to shoot pills in your veins
What it do momma? how you feeling baby?
I took the juana so obviously im feeling lazy
People out of high school tell me that I made it
What it do baby? im real fucking faded

Bitch fall back my chevy all black
Smoking baseball bats with some mallrats
Getting mad bitches preety face hoes
Even she knows she trying to find me those
In my prime ho I got that lazy flow
But the bitches on the way say its crazy though
Why you hating for? thats why they pay him for
These bitches taken for up in satan store
Nostra high 95 state of mind
State troops ain't taking no bag of mine
Past my mind what they had to find what they didn't find
But I had the kind
Zips taped to my baby blue plates
Got the high grade grape but I get it out of state
N im ill, wait bitch im fucking great
Get it got it straight
Tell em they gotta fall back....
