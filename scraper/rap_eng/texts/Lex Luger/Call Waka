[Verse 1: Cartel MGM]
Whipping through the cake in the black inner tube
All I see is cocaine money coming through
Pyrex pot, make it do what it do
Re-rock the work, make one into two
Cartel got goons trapping out the back door
18 for a deuce, 35 for a four
My bitch get mad 'cause she cooking all the time
Check the work out when my bitch hit a line
Million dollar cellie always stay ringing
Dope so good, got the J's always singing
What the fuck you want, shawty? Feeling on herself
Shawty want a eightball, tell her call Cartel

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Selling weed and crack, fuck nigga, can't you tell?
Made my first ten thousand with a pocket scale
Hooked up with Cartel, now I got it by the bale
Where we from, shawty? (Cutthroat Riverdale!)
Where them niggas gangbang, roll dice, and smoke kush
And these boys got power like they George Bush
In the trap with some Mary or cocaine
Them boys say they jacking, tell them we on the same thing
Still the same nigga, ain't shit changed
They think I won't cock back and blow out his brain
You fuck with Cartel, better yet, MGM
Kinto, Psycho, Brim, that's my partner them

[Verse 3: La Chat]
I chief-a the reefer, I blow-zo that dro-zo
I sip-o that lean-o, I pop some them Rozo's
I-I get so high, bitch, I-I cannot lie, bitch
I pop a Superman and I believe that I can fly, bitch
I-I got to take a smoke, I take a pull and I inhale it
I don't fuck with that average ass shit, I don't want it if I can't smell it
What the fuck you smoking on? What the fuck you drinking on?
I'm smoking on fruit loop and I chase it down with Goose and 'Tr√≥n
And I'm with that huffing shit, I pop and roll and jump all night
I'll throw you for your 5's and the 10's and the 20's to get my money right
I keep that green and dro, green and dope that'll make you choke
And I keep that icy watch, that's why that make you want to rob your hoe
La Chat, that high bitch, promethazine with codeine
Mix it wit some yellow and some Reagan, I'm a dope fiend
Yeah, I'm gon' keep it real, I get so wild, I'm full of pills
It's something that you gon' have to try to find out how I feel
