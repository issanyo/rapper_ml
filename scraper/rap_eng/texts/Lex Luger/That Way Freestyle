[Chorus: Jeremih]
I apologize, I don't recollect your name
(Ooh baby, I don't know your name)
But let me tell you that them heels
Really complement your frame
(Look at your body, baby)
Girl, lemme get them ooh aahs
Then I gotta catch my plane
Say you miss me and ya wishin' for some private time
Girl, how could we get that way?

[Verse: K Bicknell]
On my quest to making paper
Call me Georgia-Pacific
Like so many others in the game
Gotta keep it realistic
Oh, and did I mention that I am Autistic
Trynna make it in this game, don't call it Special Olympics
I want it that way, like I'm from Backstreet
Oh, man, I'm feeling helpless
Just like a foxes' fleet
Shout out to 50 Tyson
Shout out to Chief Keef
We need to work together
We need to squash beefs
We gotta get eggs straight from the golden geese
Hey, you wanna hear a joke? Autism Speaks
They callin' us burdens, they call us diseased
You claim to speak for us?
Forever hold your peace
