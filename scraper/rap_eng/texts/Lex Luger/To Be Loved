[Intro: Gucci Mane & Ester Dean]
I think I love her (hey, hey, hey)
..met a girl name Susie, I let her join my...
..met a girl name Susie, I let her join my...
Well, my name is Susie and Gucci think I love him
Well, my name is Susie and Gucci think I love him

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
It ain't no love in this city
Shit this industry so finicky
I rather fuck a stripper to be loved
And I'm thuggin' in the club
In the hood, in the mall, anywhere
I do not want to be loved
It's too emotional, it's business never personal
I coulda went commercial but that's not what I does
You need a hug lil' nigga
You a scrub lil' nigga
I'm a shooter, I do not want to be loved

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
[?] reminded, you've been blinded
Looking for a squad like mine you can't find it
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, jay
Bricksquad records go hard in the paint
Got my shirt just like Wooh Da Kid
Ain't nothing changed, Bricksquad the shit
Came out reppin' straight drop
I signed myself, now Gucci rich
Heavy gonja rolling bricks, 200K on promotion
Funny thing about it, did it all in just one weekend
Homie want to be a soulja but the books are closing
I'm D'd up in my office, hit the button curtains open
So you can keep your love baby, bust that pussy open
Cause I'm the king of diamonds, East Atlanta, I'm the spokesman
I'm boastin', takin' pictures posin'
Smoking like a locomotive
This man serve since Souuth Dakota
Touch down with 100 soldiers
Taking cola, taking over, should be in a rockin' roller
Hall of fame, is Gucci Mane, my chain is colder bipolar

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
It ain't no love in this city
Shit this industry so finicky
I rather fuck a stripper to be loved
And I'm thuggin' in the club
In the hood, in the mall, anywhere
I do not want to be loved
It's too emotional, it's business never personal
I coulda went commercial but that's not what I does
You need a hug lil' nigga
You a scrub lil' nigga
I'm a shooter, I do not want to be loved

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane & Ester Dean]
These hoes don't love me
There tryna fool me
You cannot trick me, yellow my time piece
Gucci Mane, I love you, I really love me
That's why I'm buying diamonds, my flow is that sweet
Gucci Mane is so street, I love South Beach
Shout out to Wyclef, I love Haiti
Shout out to Bun B, we miss Pimp C
I love 8 Ball & MJG, fuck niggas hate me
Fuck with [?] the long way, big ups to Master P
These lames ain't gotta like me or come and hug me
White girl with me, snortin' off her car keys
You don't love me, nigga you don't love me (I think I love her)
I'm back bitch, yeah I'm back bitch
Did you miss me or miss my raps bitch
I'm writing history I'm writing history
You niggas OV, yeah ain't you history
(It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
It ain't no love in this city
Shit this industry so finicky
I rather fuck a stripper to be loved
And I'm thuggin' in the club
In the hood, in the mall, anywhere
I do not want to be loved
It's too emotional, it's business never personal
I coulda went commercial but that's not what I does
You need a hug lil' nigga
You a scrub lil' nigga
I'm a shooter, I do not want to be loved
