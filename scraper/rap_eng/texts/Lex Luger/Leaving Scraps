[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
I put on now we coming up
Stay rollin' up on that good stuff
She poppin' beans and I'm off the lean
I'm about to take her back to my hood spot
Don't disrespect my new order
White magic will get him no problem
My generation needs solvin'
Bout' to take em' up we evolving
Beastcoast nigga your chick already know
Pulled up on her outside my show
I was like hop in she just say no more
"You the motherfuckin' nigga with the new god flow"
Might take a bit, elevate her shit
Now she looking at you niggas like you
Fake and shit
Put her faith inside the god tell her make a wish
She said "Damn Issa you my favorite"

[Bridge: Issa Gold]
You know I rep indigo
Way of power came from the flow
Give em' a taste
These niggas want more
Fuck the rap game, we kickin' in the door
And I'm like

[Hook]
Gimme' that takin' everything I'm only leaving scraps x2

[Verse 2: AK]
Straight off the flight, like where the weed at?
Smoke so loud shorty giving me feedback
Turn up with the crowd
Young lord so they bow, to the floor, when the gods round'
Zooted at the compound, plottin' on a million
So they can't stop now, tick tock your times out
Elevate your lifestyle amigo
We deaf to the ego, only stress for the Evo
We next nigga, Beastcoast
Groupies lookin at me like she seen a ghost
Livin' legend in your presence
So receive the growth
Spreadin' treasures every sentence
So a verse is like a blessing
Try to show the adolescents that the world is yours
Motherfuckers better maintain
When this new shit drop we finna' game change
Cop a new ziplock of that flame strain
Now I'm meditating at the top of the game mane'
