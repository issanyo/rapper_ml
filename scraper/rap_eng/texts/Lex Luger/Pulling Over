[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame (Sampled)]
I'm feeling her...
I'm feeling her...
I'm, I'm, I'm feeling her...
She feeling me...
I'm liquored up...
I'm liquored up...
Pulling, pulling over, I had enough
Pu-pu-pulling over, I had enough

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame (Sampled)]
I'm feeling her, she feeling me
I'm feeling her, she feeling me
I'm feeling her, she feeling me
I'm living life like a movie
I'm liquored up, I'm drunk as fuck
I'm pulling over, I had enough
Pulling, pulling over, I had enough
Pu-pu-pulling over, I had enough

[Verse 1: Jurrarri]
I'm pulling over, shawty say she feeling me
All red Maserati, shawty started lick on me
Two-hundred on the dash, shawty rolling on two, double dash
Shawty got me pulling over and said she wanna suck my D
While I drink on yellow lean, while I smoke on hella green
Shawty got me pulling over, now she 'bout suck on Ju
Now I'm 'bout to fuck you, then I'm gonna lick on you
Then Flocka living life, shining like the movie star
D4L, rubberband shawty made a movie
CEO of Ju Records, now we in a movie
Porn star, porn star, shawty is a porn star
Now she got me in her flick, fucking like a porn star
And her pussy good, and I found it on the OnStar
OnStar, I found it on the OnStar
Took her to the crib and then she fucked all my homeboys
She fucked all my homeboys

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame (Sampled)]
I'm feeling her, she feeling me
I'm feeling her, she feeling me
I'm feeling her, she feeling me
I'm living life like a movie
I'm liquored up, I'm drunk as fuck
I'm pulling over, I had enough
Pulling, pulling over, I had enough
Pu-pu-pulling over, I had enough

[Verse 2: Jurrarri]
I'm pulling over and now I'm 'bout to nut on Tasha
Yeah, she steady sucking Ju, now she wanna lick my jewels
Neck full of diamonds, pissy yellow, pissy brightly
Pissy yellow diamonds, sucking on my diamond
Atlanta Station motion picture, watching Tyler Perry
I'm kissing on her first, 'cause she look like Halle Berry
Kush blunts in the air, smell like Halle Berry
Nigga wrist glaring, got everybody staring
Yellow diamond shawty, 'Rarri watch full of Carats
Passport shawty, this guy back from Paris
Overseas balling and I bought a couple carats
Ju, I bought a couple carats

[Outro: Jurrarri & Waka Flocka Flame (Sampled)]
