Yeah! They gone get this work
Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce uh yeah! Lego!

[Hook: Hugh Lee]
I got no game it's just some bitches understand my story
(I got no game it's just some bitches understand my story)
And niggas love me cuz I spit that realest allegory
(And niggas love me cuz I spit that realest allegory)
I got no game it's just some bitches understand my story
(I got no game it's just some bitches understand my story)
And niggas love me cuz I spit that realest allegory
(And niggas love me cuz I spit that realest allegory)

[Verse 1: Hugh Lee]
It's Hugh Lee the chosen one
Morbidly outspoken one
Claiming y'all all beasts
But take a look you just awoken one
Lapped a couple lappers
I done wrapped a couple rappers
Everybody sleeping on me I could nap a couple nappers
The shit I spit vivid abstractly depicted
Causing phonic euphemisms and ocular wicked visions
Always going over heads so all that shit you probably missed it
Intuitive abstract thoughts I'll describe if you insist it
Murder the service excursion perverted re word it: perverted and murdered and hurted interning eternal inferno regurgo the furtho with worth though not wortho the value of first though
That's the the type of shit I'm thinking all the time
I goes crazy in my mind but when it comes out it's fine
Cuz I'll never let a nigga steal my shine
Fuck yo glory bitch I'm all about my grind
So Fuck with me no really fuck with me
Like we tag teaming bitches nigga fuck with me

[Hook: Hugh Lee]

[Verse 2: Rekless]
No guts no glory take notes on legend artist before me
Used to ignore me, but now they fiend for more of my story
I spit the crack on the mic priceless you can't afford me
Real nigga been placed in real niggas categories
A nightmare in the making some think it's horrible
I'm the music oracle verses should be historical
Keep in mind sight of the future call me the visual
They never see it coming untypical unpredictable
Bitches love me a smooth cut individual
Never planned to be stable L double H is too critical
Feeling like I'm a God, I'm spiritual and I'm lyrical
Freeing all of my demons pad and pen it's a ritual Rekless
And I'll never let a nigga steal my shine
Fuck yo glory bitch I'm all about my grind
SO Fuck with me no really fuck with me
Like we tag teaming bitches nigga fuck with me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hugh Lee]
Turn up... ok stop that shit
Niggas saying go get that Molly man you ain't never pop that shit
Talking bout a bird you ain't cop that shit
Got a 22 man you ain't mop that bitch
Just Holding on to these lies man drop that shit
I just get tired of them feeding me lies
We Copy what these rappers say cuz we look up to these guys
Screaming Bitches love Sosa no bitches love diplomas
It's 13 on the clock it's like we ain't even woke up
Its a gift when people feel what you saying
I'm a educate these niggas cause y'all rather have they brains decaying
Y'all ain't worth the cash they paying
Y'all ain't worth the gas I'm spraying
Y'all ain't worth the masses playing
But I'll never let a nigga steal my shine
Fuck yo glory bitch I'm all about my grind
So fuck with me no really fuck with me
Like we tag teaming bitches really fuck with me

[Hook]

I spit that realest Allegory
I spit that realest Allegory
Chi-raq the whole city rockin' with me
So I gotta take the whole city with me
