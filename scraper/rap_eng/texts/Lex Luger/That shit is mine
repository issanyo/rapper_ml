I am always holding my head up I share the world but mine won't let up
Familiar actions up on my chase
Push myself when I know my place
Got some thoughts that I can't erase
They get ahead but they can't replace
Let em go touch down and then I touch base(x3)
Lead it up, let it go, then I embrace(x2)
Paradox, walking on stilts while I'm wearing socks
No time for this shit and then my caring knocks
Stick with you for a bit and then my caring stops
Taking my own time for my own therapy
Constantly on the change and that's prosperity
Continue to tell the truth with transparency
Demon's to fight and they ain't sparing me(x2)
They asking for my help because of jealousy
Really I can't help cause it's my destiny no less to me
Back up off my back and you especially
Take it all in, I am breathing heavily heavily
Make it look easy cause it's my specialty
They just can't do it with my fidelity
Handle my business take the game I hold it down
Can't kill my flow cause I make it drown
Still flying high cause I'm gaining ground
Whatever it takes to define you
Looking at you at eye view
Soul connections hang and tie you
Trippy shit when you hang with my crew
Blind view reach inside and realign you
I tread lightly, then I'm mashin
Law of attraction is my fashion
Walk talk and then I'm dashin
Make my mark so hold the line
City above the city like that shit is mine (x2)


Yeah, like that shit is mine, that shit is mine
That shit is mine, that shit is mine

Walk around like that shit is mine
