[Intro]
And the kids sing
Yea, I like that, I like that, kids sing

[Chorus]
We will understand if they don't
We don't want they bullshit no more
We will understand if they don't
We don't want they bullshit no more

[Verse 1]
Alright, alright
You take too many martinis, she slip straight out bikini (straight up)
She let me grand slam outside the Denny's (straight up)
How we gone get Oscar proud if they pay us pennies? (La Flame)
I'ma need my dollars now, stack it 'til they envy
Ya feel me? (skrr!)
The kids they need that
I get that feedback, sit back, relax (that dope)
I'm on that relapse
Yo ass gone die if you blow my high
I been over Coastin' just was beatin' in my Lotus (straight up)
All that loud talk like your dope we never notice (La Flame)
You ain't feelin' it, nigga, 'cause you sober (straight up)
I'm ballin' in the game with players, you behind the coaches
Come take a trip on my lair by the Third Coast
Come floatin'
La di, da, di, da, di, all the kids shout at the party

[Chorus]
We will understand if they don't (Yeah, yeah)
We don't want they bullshit no more
Yeah I like that, I like that, yeah, kids sing
We will understand if they don't (yeah, louder)
We don't want they bullshit no more

[Interlude]
You know when I was fourteen
I wanted to do a lot of kick ass shit
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Pornographic, so dramatic, cinematic
Diamond flashes, so jurassic, dress so classic
Roll that cabbage, get put in casket, you dope fanatic
You the baddest, I'm sarcastic, we both laughin'
I'm the baddest, I'm out in traffic, four engine backin'
Stuffed in Suburban, twelve bitches straight out the beauty pageant
You know Reebok keep La feet hot, they be shipping package
GL 600 or the Palace, that collab with Classics
Tell me what you need, I got everything green
Money, money, money trees, I buy everything
That bitch need no wedding ring, she need a bean
That boy walked in mall, that boy he need a beam
I done fucked her twice you bought her Fendi things
I done sipped the act' now I'ma leany fiend
I can do this by myself, don't need no team
I got all these kids and all these kids gon' sing

[Chorus]
We will understand if they don't
We don't want they bullshit no more
We will understand if they don't
We don't want they bullshit no more
