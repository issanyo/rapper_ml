[Chorus: K. Vixen]
I'm the queen of the south, tell these hoes to step they game up
These bitches ain't it, tell them hoes to switch they lane up
Jurrarri in the Rarri, switching lanes, we 'bout to change up
I see you niggas hustling, but you need to get your change up
I'm the queen of the south, tell these hoes to step they game up
These bitches ain't it, tell them hoes to switch they lane up
Jurrarri in the Rarri, switching lanes, we 'bout to change up
I see you niggas hustling, but you need to get your change up

[Verse 1: Jurrarri]
I'm in the fast lane, 'Rarri switching lane to lane
White car, white rims, call that thing cocaine
Southside shawty, 'Rarri keep the snow, mane
Me and K. Vixen sell a hundred bricks of blow, mane
Jumped up in her [?] and push it, 'Rarri made it snow, man
Say her name was Wonder Woman, suck me on my Wonder Man
Jurrarri in a brand new Ferarri
Stick shift in the floor like a new Atari
Xbox 360, y'all playing Atari
Hoes that never fucked trying to take me to a-Maury
Catch me at Benihana, eating on calamari
Catch me at Benihana, eating on calamari
Lenox Mall shopping, you know the kid balling
Suicide doors, my Aston Martin took a overload
Me and K. Vixen got more bags than a Kroger store
Me and K. Vixen balling like a fucking a Kroger store

[Chorus: K. Vixen]
I'm the queen of the south, tell these hoes to step they game up
These bitches ain't it, tell them hoes to switch they lane up
Jurrarri in the Rarri, switching lanes, we 'bout to change up
I see you niggas hustling, but you need to get your change up
I'm the queen of the south, tell these hoes to step they game up
These bitches ain't it, tell them hoes to switch they lane up
Jurrarri in the Rarri, switching lanes, we 'bout to change up
I see you niggas hustling, but you need to get your change up

[Verse 2: K. Vixen]
I'm classy, I'm still asking, "Nigga, where your stacks be?"
K. Vixen the pharmacist, I'm serving you like Walgreens
Queen of the south, these niggas watch me like a flat screen
Million dollar lips, got these niggas wanna marry me
I got them in a daze
It turned into a trance from the way I rocked my hips and licked my lips while I'm dancing
This pretty pink pussy, he'll think I was some candy
The way I get it back, [?] gambling
I'm big trip planning, VIP status
He had to drop some bitches for the queen to drop her panties
And if a bitch wanna try me, I'ma let the 40 rip
Ain't I ain't by myself 'cause I brought my whole clip
South side, bitch, real G shit
[?] Road shawty, we done seen a hundred bricks
Betty Crocker on the stove, I'm finna whip this cake up
All you lame ass hoes need to change your game up

[Chorus: K. Vixen]
I'm the queen of the south, tell these hoes to step they game up
These bitches ain't it, tell them hoes to switch they lane up
Jurrarri in the Rarri, switching lanes, we 'bout to change up
I see you niggas hustling, but you need to get your change up
I'm the queen of the south, tell these hoes to step they game up
These bitches ain't it, tell them hoes to switch they lane up
Jurrarri in the Rarri, switching lanes, we 'bout to change up
I see you niggas hustling, but you need to get your change up
