[Intro]
Hey Lex
What year is it nigga?
Takeover
Takeoverrr

[Verse 1]
Came up ‘cause I stayed down
Yeah, all the tables done changed ‘round
Yeah, flame tucked ‘cause they hate now
Yea, we famous every state now nigga
Came a long way from the playground
Saint Paul, where it smell like K rounds
Cold like Minnesota but hot like A-Town
Fuck you talkin’ about, you can’t come ‘round here

[Bridge]
God you know you really came through for me
You blocked the evil, it’s nothing they can do to me
Rot the beef, you know it ain’t good for me
Merry broccoli, she singing in the hood to me

[Verse 2]
Old high ass nigga in some high tops
Smoking high grade with a high fade
Can’t take side streets, gotta lay low
Do it for a rap star on the highway
Baby I done been down more than I done been up
I done felt good, baby I done felt stuck
I done felt blessed, baby I done felt luck
The pigs pull me over, hope they see my hands up
Can a nigga make something one time
Can a nigga have a seat when it’s lunchtime
Do you have a whole table ‘cause I brung mine
Wrist on raindrop, neck sunshine

[Interlude]
91 Family
Nigga you gon talk, we gon’ live it
Yeah, fuckin’ right
Takeoverrr

[Verse 3]
Big bands for a real one
Easy, I was made for it
Ask me where the drive came from
Easy, I get paid for it
Still shell-shocked from the trap house
We workin’, fuck the landlord nigga
I spent mine when it feel right
You starving, tryna plan yours
[?] live, what your life like nigga?
What your life like nigga?
Ball for real or for WiFi nigga?
World tour or your wife’s flights nigga?
I flew over every skyline with a TEC in mine
Fuck a timeline nigga
Wearin’ furs, burnin’ trees, dodging snakes
That’s a wildlife nigga
Had to do it, they was sleeping again
Too high to fuck and now we beefin’ again
She owe me pussy, better not keep me again
Windows up, cannot breathe in the Benz
I threw it up, I’m never drinking again
I’m just posted by a bar, chiefing and shit
Middle finger up, I’m Makaveli
Bitch you know I’m eating, come and pat my belly
I grew up on spam, peanut butter jelly
Give me chicken nuggets with the Kool-Aid
Now I need the salmon with the crab legs
Might blow it all on a Tuesday
Had to learn to live my fucking life
From the blunt get high, fuck what you say
If I live like you I feel the way you feel
Drive that shit you driving, lay where you lay
D’usse for the summer times
I’ll be grinding for another 25
Ironically it’s when these niggas kill me that I get enough and finally come alive
Getting high on the other side
Man these rapping niggas better get it right
If I hear another motherfuckin’ lie
That might be the last motherfuckin’ time
Takeover
