Never give up nigga
Tryna make it to the top nigga

[Hook]
Plays plays plays, we're tryna make the playoffs

[Verse 1]
Too many plays (damn!)
Too many Js (damn!)
That's why I'm a winner (winner!)
Phone off the chain like a fuckin call centre (centre!)
Track me shawty
Y'all are just a sprinter
Laughing at you lames cuz my neck feel like the winter (Bling!)
Cartie that's my nigga
He'll eat y'all up for dinner
Show you how to stack it up
I could be your mentor
Y'all are some beginners
We veterans at this trappin' shit
When it comes to chasing money
Yeah boy I does this
Phone ring, big paper
Yeah I love this
Hit my phone up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Jumping off the hook man I'm trappin
Flip flip flip, dollars do gymnastics
Went up, then I might just bust it out the plastic
Had the east side juggin
Had the west side juggin
Speak to them pigs, hell nah bro we Muslim
Shawty play fair, cut that on the ticket
Jet Li swag, Dolla like to kick it
Playin with my moolah, you'll become a missin
Clothes everywhere, but I'mma keep my clean kitchen
NBA dream just all off the fiends
Dolla from the streets, I'd a seen a lot of things
Ice cream shawty, trap a dairy cream
Trap shit, trap shit
Dolla on that trap shit
If he comes to blow have shawty come and clap him

[Hook]
