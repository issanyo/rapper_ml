[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
My homeboys, I love y'all
My homeboys, I love y'all
My homeboys, I love y'all
My homeboys, I love y'all
I'ma ride with you (ride with you)
Die with you (die with you)
Police pull us over (I'll do time with you)
I'ma ride with you (ride with you)
Die with you (die with you)
Police pull us over (I'll do time with you)

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
They say I worship Satan 'cause a nigga can't get why y'all hating
I got single after single, my stardom just keeps on elevating
Grinding, I'm not celebrating, all I do is work
All I know is work, zero play, hard work
I can't think about no vehicle, I'm thinking 'bout the next meal
So my boys can eat meals, call me Flocka Get-It-All
Bricksquad Monopoly, shawty, that's the company
You fucking with the faculty, I'll knock down your whole company
I don't need no company, surround me by my homies, B
I'm a G, been a G, call me Eazy-Flocka-E
Drinking on the O.E., fucking with the oldies
Everybody know me, shawty from Grove Street

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
My homeboys, I love y'all
My homeboys, I love y'all
My homeboys, I love y'all
My homeboys, I love y'all
I'ma ride with you (ride with you)
Die with you (die with you)
Police pull us over (I'll do time with you)
I'ma ride with you (ride with you)
Die with you (die with you)
Police pull us over (I'll do time with you)

[Verse 2: YG Hootie]
Higher than the price of lawyers when you're fighting a murder
Get popped at Tam's while you're trying to buy a burger
Might see some bullet wounds, my dog lift his shirt up
Might see us on the news, you know we 'bout that murder
They paint us like we're monsters, terrorists, too
Either that or turn bitch, rather rob with the crew
That's why I need a down bitch that'll take my route
Keep it G and never let nobody take my clout
My homeboys, they stay doing time
My homeboys, they got murder on they mind
My homeboys, never gon' turn snitch
Rather rob with the blique, put slugs in the bitch
My homeboys

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
My homeboys, I love y'all
My homeboys, I love y'all
My homeboys, I love y'all
My homeboys, I love y'all
I'ma ride with you (ride with you)
Die with you (die with you)
Police pull us over (I'll do time with you)
I'ma ride with you (ride with you)
Die with you (die with you)
Police pull us over (I'll do time with you)

[Verse 3: P Smurf]
Levi's sagging like my Lowrider on the shocks
Smurf ain't from CTE, but Blood raw
Violate probation and I'm probably with my partners
Get ATL love like that nigga Waka
Flocka get figuerola like he Poppa
I'm in that old school, breaking niggas off proper
We on them deuces like Chris Brown's new song
Feel like Lucifer when I throw them red shoes on

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
My homeboys, I love y'all
My homeboys, I love y'all
My homeboys, I love y'all
My homeboys, I love y'all
I'ma ride with you (ride with you)
Die with you (die with you)
Police pull us over (I'll do time with you)
I'ma ride with you (ride with you)
Die with you (die with you)
Police pull us over (I'll do time with you)

[Verse 4: Ice Burgandy]
My homeboys
Yeah, bitch, I said my homeboys
We the reason why we sitting here, we made our own noise
Chrome toys, cock it back, busting, laying niggas down
All my niggas really with that function, we don't play around
The K will sound: "Bow! Bow! Bow!" And I don't stay around
This one for my homeboys repping A-Town
I'm on my way to Chase now, I move them grapes out
Waka got me business meetings, setting up my PayPal
This one's for my homeboys, you know I shine for you
Your bid worse than mine? I'll do the time for you
Police pull us over, I want my lawyer
I'm sticking to the script, you know I'll ride or die for you

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
My homeboys, I love y'all
My homeboys, I love y'all
My homeboys, I love y'all
My homeboys, I love y'all
I'ma ride with you (ride with you)
Die with you (die with you)
Police pull us over (I'll do time with you)
