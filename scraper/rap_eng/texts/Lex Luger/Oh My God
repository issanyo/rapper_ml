[Hook]
Motherfuck' a hater, bitch I'm on my job
Hustle for my fam' like I owe my squad
88' Caprice with the chrome exhaust
Sun hit the paint, say oh my god
Oh my god, bitch oh my god
Walk up in the spot like I'm so raw
Bitches hit the floor, go, slob on my knob
Make her bow down and say oh my god

[Verse 1]
Can't say shit, I'm my own boss
Life's like teeth, everyday I floss
Every way I slaved, just paid off
I used to hate it all, used to wish that I would fall
Till I hit the very bottom of the fire in the pond
All day long I would stare at the bong
Wishin' I was on, no weed to keep me calm
You're tweakin' when your palms all sweaty from the cause
You prayin' on a cross though you don't believe in God
Prayin' on a cross but you run when Satan calls
911 bitch I'm fatal to the law
They hate it when you ball, this game is a facade
They fake it till they make it, left them motherfuckers lost
The key to achieve is to be true to who you are
Practice what I preach, youngin' it'll take you far

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Oh my god, bitch oh my god
I don't say swag, I say gaaaws
The opposite of what you faggots think is really hard
They Disney type of art, them lions king me Scar
Raw cocaine get it straight from out the jar
Gotta chase after your heart, Dustin Dunn go-kart
Ready set start, these digits lookin' large
Grinding on my jaw like a fucking chainsaw
They hate it when you ball, this game is a facade
Friends steady hatin', left them motherfuckers lost
Practice what I preach, youngin' it'll take you far
Luger, Ikabod, this shit is too beyond
We simply too raw, cut the check and call my God
The key to achieve is to be true to who you are
Practice what I preach, youngin' it'll take you far

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Oh my god, bitch oh my god
Slam through that pussy like I'm playin' pogs
Smash on that pussy with some Conan paws
She say Ikabod, my name Ikabod
Used to have to blaze dro, before my J.O
That kush and mango, shoutout to J Mo
You gotta grind and lay low, work for them pesos
Now make it shake ho, gotta make more
Gumby, money, cake, doe, mozzarella, queso
Shark mode, go Mako, my bank roll
They hate how it grow
With a little bit of time and patience ignore the hatin', watch as I blow
Take flight I aim for, that K.O
Don't believe me ask Able
Katanas in a Honda, I'ma devil rockin' a halo
My flows are fucking fatal, gotta slow it down with Able
Sippin' syrup through my nasal, 3rd rail bit the cable
Got a stripper named Sable, she please me when I say so
Sucked my dick in a Sable, then I fucked her under Kados
