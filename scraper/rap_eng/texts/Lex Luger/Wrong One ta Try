[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
They 'bout to make me come up out my Pradas
Grab a ski mask and the chopper
You niggas still trying to rob the robbers
I'm the answer, what the fuck's your problem?

[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin]
Okay, left 300, shoot 400
Snapback cash, strapped up, I ain't running
G5 on me, Brick Squad youngin'
Bands right there got the TEC-9 drumming
Blaat, tick tack, nigga, take that
Blaat, OG like a 8-track
Blaat, more pumps than [?]
Pulled up in a Maybach, club go straight jack
I'm in a straight jacket, I'ma stay bracking
Pistol with me, black [?] leave your face flat
Put Atlanta on my back like a Braves jacket
Lots of flying body parts
Automatic in my hood, AK my shit
I don't play the radio and they don't play my shit, squad

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
They 'bout to make me come up out my Pradas
Grab a ski mask and the chopper
You niggas still trying to rob the robbers
I'm the answer, what the fuck's your problem?

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Ask my Ã©se partners, they say Flocka loco
Make the doctor button up your chest just like a polo
Shots fired, dropped ocho niggas on the floor
Thirty grand or more, then I'm kicking down your door
You don't cooperate, I'll turn into the Persian War
What you crying for? You a [?]
Chrome 44, give me what I'm asking for
Stacks, pills, and that fucking blow

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
They 'bout to make me come up out my Pradas
Grab a ski mask and the chopper
You niggas still trying to rob the robbers
I'm the answer, what the fuck's your problem?

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Came on vacation, left on probation
Got the Lamb on park, but my mind racing
Call it that, Coke Boys team, I'm the quarterback
Got me on lean like a quarter flat
She left with me, never calling back
Wouldn't spend a M, I stayed off
Grind all day, better pay off
No, I'd let her bury like Adolf
Hundred round let that K off
Get out of the way when I dump
Flocka, pop that trunk
Let that Twin Towers dunk
Montana

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
I'm the wrong one to try if you don't wanna die
They 'bout to make me come up out my Pradas
Grab a ski mask and the chopper
You niggas still trying to rob the robbers
I'm the answer, what the fuck's your problem?
