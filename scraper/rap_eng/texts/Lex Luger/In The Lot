[Intro]
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Hundred thousand dollar cars in the parking lot

[Verse 1]
Might purple Bape my Wraith, paint it camouflage grape
Jamming a screw tape with a jernt in my face
All of this was God’s grace, He put me in this place
I get high pray everyday riding up a one way
The direction I’m heading wherever the bread is
These niggas tryna sound like us and they really from my section
Real hustlers in the world is linking up and connecting
An organized movement is a dangerous weapon
Drop back like Tom Brady’s I made the assist
In the field they try to play but they never catch me
They styles too messy and I’m too ready
This cake penny Andretti nigga my chain too heavy

[Hook]
Hundred thousand dollar cars in the parking lot
Big dogs in here ain't no pups allowed
Hundred thousand dollar cars in the parking lot
We brought some real bitches with us ain’t no thots allowed
No ain’t no thots allowed
No ain’t no pups allowed
Hundred thousand dollar cars in the parking lot
Yeah they cost a lot, know what I’m talking about
Thats hundred thousand dollar cars in the parking lot

[Verse 2]
Shit so new they didn’t know what to call it
All they saw is a 2 door and it came with a spoiler
The Dealer want twelve hundred dollar just to change the oil
Luxury tax just the cost of balling
Three cellphones darling I still can’t call it
She want an explanation I ain’t got nothing for it
I got the Azure I got the Allure they in the garage
Vintage money cars in storage I’m making room for more
Hundred thousand dollar cars bitch
Casualties of this fucking drug war bitch
Yeah uh we wasn’t born rich
We just rappers without a cause
Word to James dean [?]
