[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Ay I’m like, make that fucker bark
This gon' be hard
Oh, that shit gon' be hard

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
They say Flocka tripping, shawty on that other shit
I keep the crowd jumping like I'm Kris Kross, bitch
I ain't gone cross over, ay, rap nigga, move over
They say I ain't gone make it, so this year, I gotta show you
Man, I'm known in the hood for making that fucker bark
You know Flocka shoot first like John Starks
40 nights, 40 days, no Noah's ark
If we was living in water, I'd be a shark
I'm in the front, you in the back like Rosa Parks
Got heart like Rosa Parks, ay, where the fuck to start?
Don't got the gun, then I'ma use a dart
I fell in love with yellow diamonds since Gucci's Bart
Bitch, we shooting over here, no martial arts
Oh, okay, man
I'm finna go in, man, real talk, man
I got nigga knowledge, your girlfriend's pussy got hella mileage
I’m a street nigga, so middle finger to the college

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
They say snakes in the grass, so I’ma cut this shit
All these girls want is cash, so I can’t trust the bitch
12 pull up, run fast, can't go to jail for shit
I got cars, ice, and hoes, shawty, I'm nigga rich
They say snakes in the grass, so I’ma cut this shit
All these girls want is cash, so I can’t trust the bitch
12 pull up, run fast, can't go to jail for shit
I got cars, ice, and hoes, shawty, I'm nigga rich

[Verse 2: Cartier Kitten]
Cartier, no watch, so high that my ears pop
Right here, where that Lear drop, hop out yeah, like, that's hot
Now where the bread? I'ma need that, boo
When it off the head, I'ma need like two
Nigga rich, what that make you?
I'ma trigger chick, my belt, my proof
Now what you want? I'ma shut this down
Niggas try to front like I don't run this town
Niggas try to front like I don't wreck this shit
Nigga, hide the blunt, I smell the piff
While I'm tipping corners, I'm rolling with foreigners
My hoes be Brazilian, Sicilian, Honduras
Got bread to blow, got a mean sixteen
Turn the camera on, I'ma rep my team
I'm making hits, like, back to back
Y'all cute and shit, y'all try to rap
Get stupid, chick, how you trying to act
I'm stupid rich, no platinum plaques
I'm nigga rich, boy, what you rep?
No nigga business, no nigga checks
Cartier

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
They say snakes in the grass, so I’ma cut this shit
All these girls want is cash, so I can’t trust the bitch
12 pull up, run fast, can't go to jail for shit
I got cars, ice, and hoes, shawty, I'm nigga rich
They say snakes in the grass, so I’ma cut this shit
All these girls want is cash, so I can’t trust the bitch
12 pull up, run fast, can't go to jail for shit
I got cars, ice, and hoes, shawty, I'm nigga rich
