(Hook)
So long ago they
Would talk shit
Where they at today?

They said I wouldn't make it
Look at them today!

I'm counting O's today
I'm fucking hoes today
I'm blowing smoke today
That and each and everyday
They said we wouldn't
Be here hey!
But look at them
And look at us today!

(Verse)

I curate the culture
I'm a hawk among vultures
I swear I'm harder
Than most of
Most of these rappers
These rappers
Ya know of
It's 3k for the quota
Dove and Sour my oder
The flow sick
Like Ebola
These niggas speaking umoja
I'm like nigga please...
You could catching zurkin
In V(12)
Your girlfriend love my R&B
I made a movie with her
Staring me oh no
You aren't me
I'm a buck from the line
Niggas is foul
So I'm just stuck at line
Talent is talent
Niggas could
Niggas relate cause
I stuck to the grind
One the best
The best in the league
Open your mind
Maybe you'll see
Maybe you won't
Patience is key
My nigga come
Learn from a G

(Hook)

So long ago they
Would talk shit
Where they at today?

They said I wouldn't make it
Where they at today!

I'm counting O's today
I'm fucking hoes today
I'm blowing smoke today
That and each and everyday
They said we wouldn't
Be here aye?
But look at them
And look at us today!

Neako (Verse)

Don't get me excited
I pull up and light it
The girl you like
She right here beside me
She already like me
Them niggas you came with
Them niggas is pussy
So nigga don't push me
Them niggas you bang with
Them niggas is cowards
We focused on power
I'm after this money
You after my next shit
You after my old shit
The niggas I'm with
They overly focused
They ready to blow shit
Yeah...
We rapping the dead on that ghost shit
You niggas is studying me
You copy my whole shit
Designing you niggas
From clothes down to the flow switch
She poppin that pussy for me
She get on that pole quick
My nigga you know this
