[Intro]
That's trippy shit right here bruh

[Hook]
Don't pass me no regular, I'mma turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
Don't pass me no regular, I'mma turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm burnin' loud til my lungs burnt up

[Verse 1]
Smokin' gas in a rental
She givin' me mental
Countin faces (countin faces)
While she poppin molly like mentos
I got money forreal though
Split blunts down the middle
I got love for everybody, who give a fuck how you feel though
In a big house with 10 hoes
Catch me in the hills blowin endo
Pool party, that's indoors
So much gin, take a swim ho
Homie pass the weed, let's get super high
I smoke that shit that made R. Kelly think that he could fly
Droppin racks off one plate
Took her to the strip then blew it
Took a lot of gin and some pills, took her to my hotel room like screw it
Smokin on pounds, smokin on pounds
In Seattle where ain't no crime
All I do is smoke weed and rhyme
Sip codeine just to ease my mind

[Hook]
Don't pass me no regular, I'mma turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
Don't pass me no regular, I'mma turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm burnin' loud til my lungs burnt up

[Verse 2]
Chugging on lean and I’m chiefing on skunk
With your main girl, eat my dick like its lunch
Kick it so tough, you would think I’m gon punt
Nigga so high, you would think I’m gon jump
Upwards and downwards just like a seesaw
Her titties keep bouncing just like a beach ball
She’s on one, I’m on two, we smoking, we fucking
On so many drugs that we can’t sleep it off
Goons on my side, I got cars I don’t drive
Got a bitch in my bed that’s somebody’s bride
Got kush in my blunt, got lean in my sprite
I’m drunk as a fish and I’m high as a kite
Two dime bitches and I’m in the middle
Maybach come with curtains, I ain’t got tinted windows
Eyes stay low, I look oriental
That’s the killer loud pack in my cigarillo
No Reggie in my presence, tell them niggas get it right
I got girls doing girls, now that’s the shit I like
Now that’s the shit I love, give me pussy, money, drugs
I take thirty out my stash and go blow it with my blood

[Hook]
Don't pass me no regular, I'mma turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
Don't pass me no regular, I'mma turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm burnin' loud til my lungs burnt up
