[Hook]
It’s getting hard to love me
Don’t get no privacy in public
I can tell it’s getting hard to love me
Catching flights and tripping over luggage
I can tell it’s getting hard to love me
No no, it ain’t used to been like this
I can tell it’s getting hard to love me
Yeah, we can’t get no privacy in public
I can tell it’s getting hard to love me
Catching flights and tripping over luggage
I can tell it’s getting hard to love me
Oh no, it ain’t used to been like this
I can tell it’s getting hard to love me
I said the shit ain’t never been like this

[Verse 1]
Argue and fuck, fuck and argue
You don’t get it, I don’t get it, what’s your problem?
I’m sick of your shit, who you texting? Who you calling?
I cannot lie, I see it on you
I can tell it’s getting hard to love me
And you sit next to me, still feel far from me
And when you texting me it take an hour for me
To write back like one thing
I was texting money, I’m just saying girl
This shit payoff gon’ have us way up, no lie
And I finally got my weight up
And now you say it’s getting hard to love me
But you know this shit’s yours, don’t ever borrow from me
Don’t ever borrow from me
I make sure them bitches notice you
I do what I’m ‘posed to do
Thinking matching Rollies too
You got an address to a young fly nigga
This my lifestyle for life baby
You knew that when you let me hit it

[Hook]
It’s getting hard to love me
Don’t get no privacy in public
I can tell it’s getting hard to love me
Catching flights and tripping over luggage
I can tell it’s getting hard to love me
No no, it ain’t used to been like this
I can tell it’s getting hard to love me
Yeah, we can’t get no privacy in public
I can tell it’s getting hard to love me
