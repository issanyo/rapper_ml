[Intro]
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, Lex Luger on the beat so what the fuck you think?

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Paddy cake, paddy cake, bake a brick (bake a brick)
I'm in the traphouse, bitch we ain't servin' [?]
We got bows, we ain't sellin' no Os
We drivin' lows, sendin' word coast-to-coast
Fill his body up with holes, wipe his nose
We made millions in the trap, we want more
No cap, got good clean for your nose
Every play I catch, I break it with the bros

[Verse 1: Krazy Blacx]
Wipe the cocaine off your nose, quit that crazy stuff
She just snorted off the stove, you some freaky fuck
She just wanna fuck, [?]
I got two-hundred for you if you bring her
[?]
I'm so young nigga, and I'm really gettin' it
I got Michigan for real, and they really gimme
Any time I call, they gon' flood the kitchen
Young nigga ball, I ain't work with [?] snitches, take 'em off
Last nigga tried to snitch, you know we knocked 'em down
I ain't lyin', I keep 21, they ride with me

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Paddy cake, paddy cake, bake a brick (bake a brick)
I'm in the traphouse, bitch we ain't servin' [?]
We got bows, we ain't sellin' no Os
We drivin' lows, sendin' word coast-to-coast
Fill his body up with holes, wipe his nose
We made millions in the trap, we want more
No cap, got good clean for your nose
Every play I catch, I break it with the bros

[Verse 2: Loudiene]
Six figures on my neck (for real)
I'd die for my respect (for real)
Fuck a bitch, chase a check (for real)
If you owe me money, where's it at?
Fuck a nine, that's a tech [?]
I came up off a set (for real)
[?]
[?]
[?]
I'm in love with the drugs, I got issues
[?] bricks on groupie hoes

Pink toes, white hoes
White hoes, white toes
Traphouse like stove
Dually truck, overload
I throw the load on a stripper (for real)
I fucked her twice 'cause I tipped (for real)

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Hundred K, paddy cake, bake a brick (bake a brick)
I'm in the traphouse, bitch we ain't servin' [?]
We got bows, we ain't sellin' no Os (nigga)
We drivin' lows, sendin' word coast-to-coast
Fill his body up with holes, wipe his nose
We made millions in the trap, we want more (Flocka!)
No cap, got good clean for your nose
Every play I catch, I break it with the bros (with the bros)

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bow! Bow! Bow!
All you heard and what you seen was gunsmoke
Fuck that nigga bitch slow, pull up, he a no-show
Whole hood on go, [?]
When we ride on a nigga we get loaded Lambos
You a opp, hoe (hoe)
Nine times out of ten, the hood gon' fuck your hoe
How could you respect a nigga and you know he snitchin'?
Niggas grew up Ninja Turtles, that ain't how we livin'
I'm in the Double-R Drop and the top missin'
Phone call away, the brick man pull up
Rich ass nigga, big gut, tattoos, and icy
Waka Flocka Flame and ain't no other nigga like me

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Paddy cake, paddy cake, bake a brick (bake a brick)
I'm in the traphouse, bitch we ain't servin' [?]
We got bows, we ain't sellin' no Os
We drivin' lows, sendin' word coast-to-coast
Fill his body up with holes, wipe his nose
We made millions in the trap, we want more (f-f-flex)
No cap, got good clean for your nose
Every play I catch, I break it with the bros

[Outro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Squad!
You gotta work hard, fuck nigga, get off your ass, catch your own play, fuck nigga
On god, nigga
[?] Squad!
