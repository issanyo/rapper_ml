[Verse 1: AK]
You niggas couldn't fuck with me, even on a bad trip on acid
Or psilocybin, some hashish could get disastrous
But foe or no-foe, don't lose your soul indigo
There's loopholes on the globe if you gold then they shown
A storm's been predicted on your forecast
Rebirth the energy of earth when his tongue snaps
This is my turf, verse leave them with a swamp sack
Come to combat, I'm Rambo or Bojack
With a bat crack, your whole frame dissemble that
Always peace and love but know them thugs remember, uh
Tripping on them drugs when no one was like fuck a buzz
I'm in the astral of these capsules with cash flow
Like the last toke, I'm most appreciated
Most high, abbreviated, I'm God, IG
Ain't signed on in five weeks, but still collide G's like Siamese
'So chill 'ma pleas and just fulfill my needs
Got a momma back at home the only women I need
Hoping that her son prosper so she finally free
In interviews they say I'm awkward but my flow gon' break the thermometer
So go ahead nigga monitor cause that's where I'mma be at
Breeze past all the chit chat and look back, pockets is fatter
But that shit don't even matter, I'm trying to climb up this ladder
Enlighten all of the masses, detach, living life backwards
So get your ass off that mattress, my task uplift the atlas

[Verse 2: Issa Gold]
Fueled by prophecy and burning the best trees
I raised myself up nigga and my parents just help me
Now I'm a major threat to all these veteran MCs
Whose using two eyes nigga, but I told you I grip three
But use one in this game of life you need the rules son
Respect queen karma, you wondering, why you losing
23 years old and I'm teaching a million students
And who would've thought to do it, I be murderous at this music
Point I'm proving, walking in a line you looking fucking stupid
She's the Shepard, yeah you free but they watching all of your movements
Say you got a brain inside of your skull, let me see you prove it
Niggas thought they had a grip on the game 'til we tamed and swooped it
Issa Gold the prophet nigga bearing gold of soul
Holy flow got me rapping with AK across the globe
Killing shows bakery pockets, nigga that's sacred dough
Making flow, seeing nigga got all the ducks in a row
Came through with the prophet topic, triple vision peep the options
Take my time before I drop it so a nigga reap the prophets
I'm a prophet I told y'all but some of these niggas think
I hate God, compare him to Adolf but I ain't no retard
Oops, I dropped the 'R' bomb, they saying I'm more smart
These niggas living way off, talking about dreams but they don't start
Lyrical Mozart, my angels playing gold harps
They aiming at your Danes heart and hope that we will make art
