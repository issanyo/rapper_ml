[Intro]
Yeah, im drinking tea. I usually do that before a record. Let me hear the sample again?
I love it!

[Verse 1]
You say bands will make her dance, we say Rands will make her dance
Her favorite rapper Waka and she ain't using no hands
There ain't no Mrs right so there can not be a ten
And thats a mathematical problem cause how will we advance

She loves to eat Kapana, Balling out on Saturday
Clubbing with her friends then she's in church on Sunday
Doing work on Monday she gotta get it in anyway
You see her working over there tinna get her paycheck so she can do it again

(I Tell her) You dont deserve to be with him if he ain't loving you
(I Tell her) Come to me cause girl i will give it all for you
Split my heart in two, let you have the better half
Even if the joke ain't funny i will always laugh

I like a girl who likes snap-backs, I love a girl who loves trap music
Walking out with those dumbbells, homie she ain't even that stupid
Got a brain then you gotta use it, come on dawg just go and prove it
Trinna get your muscles up, stop being gay and go hustle hard

[Pre-Hook]
Cause you got a bunch of money, she gone take it from you
You ain't got no job, that ho dont want you
She trinna get her paper, she trinna get your paper
She trinna get her paper, she trinna get your paper

[Hook]
Oh lord this girl is so greedy! Oh lord this girl is so greedy!
Oh lord this girl is so greedy! Oh lord this girl is so greedy!
Thirsty thirsty thirsty thirsty, Thirsty thirsty thirsty thirsty
Thirsty thirsty thirsty thirsty, Thirsty thirsty thirsty thirsty
