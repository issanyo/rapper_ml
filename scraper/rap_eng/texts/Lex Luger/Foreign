[Intro]
Fell in love with this girl
I fell in love with this girl

[Chorus]
I fell in love with this chick while I was touring
I heard from overseas, yeah, she foreign
She said she tired of you nigga, yeah, you boring
And it sure that ain't you riding in that foreign
She like foreign, she want foreign
We want foreign, she want foreign
She want foreign, we want foreign
But a bitch can't park till it's foreign

[Verse 1]
She like Nas swag, she say you boring
She like my cash and so I throw it
Beat that, beat that pussy K, she say it's so deep
That pussy wet, feel like I'm floating
I'm up on it, I'm on it
You said you want that foreign, I know it
Baby, could you show it?

[Chorus]
I fell in love with this chick while I was touring
I heard from overseas, yeah, she foreign
She said she tired of you nigga, yeah, you boring
And it sure that ain't you riding in that foreign
She like foreign, she want foreign
We want foreign, she want foreign
She want foreign, we want foreign
But a bitch can't park till it's foreign

[Verse 2]
I can buy you what you want
Give you what you need
2K in my pocket just for us to eat
Beat that pussy up till you fall asleep
Eat that pussy up till you cannot speak
I'm up on it, I'm on it
You said you want that foreign, I know it
Baby, could you show it?

[Chorus]
I fell in love with this chick while I was touring
I heard from overseas, yeah, she foreign
She said she tired of you nigga, yeah, you boring
And it sure that ain't you riding in that foreign
She like foreign, she want foreign
We want foreign, she want foreign
She want foreign, we want foreign
But a bitch can't park till it's foreign
