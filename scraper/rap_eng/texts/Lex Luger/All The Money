[Intro: Young Jeezy]
If you take a look in my eyes, bet you wouldn't even be surprised
If I'm in this way inside, then we gon' club until the sunrise

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
Top down, day sunny, still got a pocket full of yesterday's money
Everyday rain, snow, sunny, that's why I hustle nonstop I want all the money
All the money, All the money thats why we hustle nonstop we want all the money
All the money, all the money, that's why I hustle nonstop I want all the money

[Verse 1 - Jeezy:]
Shit lookin' good I dunno dawg, niggas talkin' crazy they even know dawg
Yea this shit sound good you gotta show dawg, be the last man standin' I'mma show ya'll
Uh, Yea, need a snow dawg, when that bag come in call it snowfall
And I been movin' halves since three six
Met him at the Walgreens took a three six
Got another play, three o'clock sharp
87 white tee I'm three o'clock sharp
Grind it up til it's longer than a club line
Yea you know I'm stayin' down til the club time

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - 211:]
I want all the money they say I'm a greedy nigga
Neva satisfied my [?] say I'm a needy nigga
I told em money over pussy that's a nonstop
I'm talkin' 24/7 I'm always on the clock
211 in this mother fucker run it
Got a gangbang jacket out, my resume is gutta
I'm from kill california nigga everyday is sunny
Cash money in my pocket, I'm a everyday stunna
The real is back me Young and Drama
Still drunk from last night spendin' yesterdays dollas
Fresh up off the lot my nigga no frontin
Turn this hard top to a drop with one button

[Hook]
