[Tha Clip]

This the PSM Takeover
Devastation is your fate G
This the rap game makeover
Renovation like HG
TV, tv is what I am going to be on
Accepting a grammy for best rapper standing that's why imma shine brighter than neon
I talked about levels as hot as the devil but what [?] do you put me on?
Put yourself higher, then give me the lighter, but come on my nigga let's be hon-
Est, if this isn't sick, I don't know what ill be
Make you look like a fool, like you was Lil B
I respect your attempts, but you're under me
And I advise you
(Don't fuck with me)

My survival tactics, do you stay attracted?
I don't make it plastic, I will make it platinum
Get an automatic, this just target practice
Better get the cashes or just get the caskets
I done killed these niggas already
Cause these ill rhymes potentially deadly
PSM still be building up steady
Turn the bass up high cause we getting heavy
(I can feel it in my chest)
Get my brain out, cause I done lost it
Where that 1 Train? I know you niggas done hopped off it
And we still making big profit!
Maybe it's just because me and Stunna are the bosses
