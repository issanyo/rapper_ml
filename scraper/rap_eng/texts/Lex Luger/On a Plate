[Chorus]
He on a plate (yuh)
He on a plate
Ain't no running from me nigga if I put you on a plate
Plug hit my line, I told him send 'em bitches ándale (ándale, ándale)
Who wanna play? (Who?)
Put you on a plate
Ain't no running from me nigga if I put you on a plate
Plug hit my line I told him send 'em bitches ándale (ándale)

[Verse 1]
Taps is on the fade, so you know you don't play
[?], so you know he ain't gon play
Whole hood dripping red, lil pussy nigga
Whole hood dripping red, lil pussy nigga
He beat up on the money, that boy gon' shoot ya
Waka Flocka love your hood, I might recuit ya (for real)
I can't fuck with a bitch, you know it
Two Rollies and that AP, tonight I'ma throw it (flex)
P-put that pussy on the plate, told that young'un eat it [?]
He full, we don't fuck with fake niggas (for real)
We don't hate, we just stack cake
We ain't saving nobody, feed 'em to the apes (squad!)

[Chorus]
He on a plate (yuh)
He on a plate
Ain't no running from me nigga if I put you on a plate
Plug hit my line, I told him send 'em bitches ándale (ándale, ándale)
Who wanna play? (Yuh! Who?)
Put you on a plate
Ain't no running from me nigga if I put you on a plate
Plug hit my line I told him send 'em bitches ándale

[Verse 2]
I'm in the spot with a carbon in the blow torch
We gon' swoop that pussy nigga like a new Ford
He cookin' dope and he eating off the same fork
We shooting pills just all we had like this shit is a sport
Hopped off the Porsche, then I jumped in a horse
Niggas hatin' me and they fakin' that at same time
I keep stendos in my clips, they got hangtime
Goonies right here lurking and these niggas snorting lines
Nigga this shit ain't no tape, you can't press rewind (real shit)
If I put you on a plate, boy it's dinnertime (chicken wings)
Touch one of mine, I'm gonna lose my mind (for real, for real)
That's a jungle on my college shit, [?]
Fuck the cops, bitch we gunnin' at them porcupines

[Chorus]
He on a plate (yuh)
He on a plate
Ain't no running from me nigga if I put you on a plate
Plug hit my line, I told him send 'em bitches ándale
Who wanna play?
Put you on a plate
Ain't no running from me nigga if I put you on a plate
Plug hit my line I told him send 'em bitches ándale
