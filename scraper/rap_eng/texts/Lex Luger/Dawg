[Intro]
Takeoverrr

[Verse 1]
I bust my nut and grab my key, start my whip
If she think she really mean something to me, she ain’t shit
Dick fire motherfucker, but you still another bitch
I don’t need another nigga in my business, on my dick
I just left the bank, it look like I just hit another lick
Play with who? This hold 30, I don’t need another clip
She keep lying like she single, man this ho must think she slick
How she love you when she all up in my DM’s sending pics
I’m a baller, I’m a leader, I’m a dog, I’m a pit
This shit sound like Lex was in the kitchen bustin’ down a brick
Favorite rapper, tell you ‘bout me for a minute, I been lit
I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a pit

[Hook]
I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a pit
I’m a dog, I’m a pit
I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a pit
I’m a dog, I’m a pit
I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a pit
I’m a dog, I’m a pit
I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a pit
I’m a dog, I’m a pit

[Verse 2]
These niggas mad at Taylor ‘cause I’m classy
Was ashy, they wanna see me down bad, beggin’ and askin’
You can’t be my wife and I can’t be your baby daddy
She lick me in the front seat, I hit her in the back seat
Niggas want my life so they might try to get at me
Yeah they say they hate me but they see me and dap me
No I can’t tell you why they act like that with me, don’t ask me
But if I had to guess, could be the Benz or the bad bitch
I fuck her like I love her then I leave her like a savage
Might eat her like some puppy chow or turn her to a sandwich
I’m a blue-nose pit with a big black dick
Walk inside my motherfuckin’ yard and shit get tragic

[Hook]
I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a pit
I’m a dog, I’m a pit
I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a pit
I’m a dog, I’m a pit
I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a pit
I’m a dog, I’m a pit
I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a dog, I’m a pit
I’m a dog, I’m a pit
