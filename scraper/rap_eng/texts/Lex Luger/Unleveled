[Trap-A-Holics, real trap shit]

[Ad-Libs]
Aye!
Ah!

[Verse 1]
Too busy down in dump, too busy playing chump
My wave another level, I feel like I'm the Devil
Know that I'm unleveled, I feel like the Devil
You playing with fire, bitch, I am retired
Wasn't even hot 'cause I'm a rotten fucking fire
Take it higher, I don't do supplying
Fuckboy always tripping, you a druggie, hope you dying

[Hook]
I feel like the Devil, I feel like a devil
Unlike all the devils, know that I'm unleveled
I feel like the Devil, I feel like a devil
Unlike all the devils, know that I'm unleveled
