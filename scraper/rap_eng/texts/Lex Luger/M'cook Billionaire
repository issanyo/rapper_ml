[Verse 1: Sba Pioneer]

First I'd like to start
By showing you, you mediocre
The higher I get
The more my game gets colder
Mzansi rap game
E tletse ka bafana
Matter of fact

Bonang Fela

We smell like kush
While they smell like doom ya mafel'

All those bitches call me king

All my bitches call me king

They know that I'm deep
I ain't talking Rocco

As if it was a fucken bongo

King of capcity
I got it on my CV
Walk into your office
This is how your boss greets me
Let these fuckboys
Continue making rumours
While I eat they cash
With that niqqa Jacob Zuma

Squad leader written
On my fucken resume
Killing you niqqas
Come and see your grave
Fuck a soft nigga
No fagots in my pack
Fuck a soft nigga
No fagots in my pack

All these nyaope niggas
Working overtime

Bitch niggas kadi moyan
Cheap ass niggas
Coppin' from makwero

Rest in peace Guerrero

Still full of shit
Stay smoking
While they eating out of my shit

[Hook: Sba Pioneer]

Forty hundred struggles

But your bitch give me dairy
Ain't no hit-n-run

So I can show em
I ain't even scared of the system
Levels to this shit
That's why I'm on top of the building

Madibas talk

Is why I'm always on the grind
And never in the sheets
On this white foam

Even in the water
I'm the ugly duckling

But the bitch fall for me
Like she Humpty Dumpty
But the bitch ride me
Like a new Humvee

Even in the water

But the bitch fall for me

Cooking up in the hood
