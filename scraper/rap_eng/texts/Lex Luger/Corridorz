Yah yah yah yah
(Lex Luger)
I like to blow grams quick/
Watch boogie nights and stare at heather graham's tits/
Yuh yuh yuh yuh/
Took the seven dwarfs, put em all in an orphanage/
So i could fuck snow white in all of her orifices/
I take drugs, go through a metamorphosis/
Swallowed both the pills that was offered by morpheus/
Played chess on the moon 'gainst a bunch of sorcerers/
I bet id clean house if they still had the source awards/
Im at the corner store/ bout to flip a quarter for/
A quarter more/ than i scored it for/
Bumps in the corridor/
That's what we call horderves/
Vacuum sealed odors get ordered/
Oh lord, smoking blunts in an old ford/

Dev11n / HOOK

All my life they told me/
I could have it all if only/
I could be like them/
Be like them/ be like them/
But fuck that shit/
Dont acknowledge competition now we run that shit/
Come through ya city like we from that shit/
It's only us that's it/
So bitch act like you know you know you know/

Short Moscato:

They sneaky in the buff
We runnin routes like Don Beebee
When they see me on the TV
Hands is out needin freebies
People give me heebie jeebies
Graffiti, Tahitian treaty
Gotta beanie fulla dreams
And a freaky cristina ricci
Shes preachy, and sorta creepy
Yall dont see me like stevie
But we see the light in seedy life
Prolly won't sleep tonight
I eat a piece of life, it taste right, its seasoned nice
We got hot quick like some easy rice
Built a following thats into weed, tabs n klonopin
Bags of bobby brown and brain cells up in they bodycounts
Fuck a nose i gotta snotty mouth
Raised on moms spaghetti and atari sounds
I smell like rastafari's now, hey

Bendyface:

Ollie off the balcony, catapult to the stratosphere
I backstroke in saturns rings, how the fuck did i land in here
Now everyday im dapper dear, mistake me as a martian
And im thrivin in the marshlands, im a serotonin sergeant
All these chemicals is caustic, put a hole up in my pocket
Officially i lost it, delinquents in apartments
Can fit a lot of drugs inside these very breezy garments
And im cautious where im steppin cuz i scarcely clean the carpets
Im a heathen seekin lines i rarely stay between the margins
Shit its 7 in the mornin and we barely even started
All these substances cut with somethin the air we breathe is tarnished
Imma stand and reap the harvest, leave a legacy regardless
