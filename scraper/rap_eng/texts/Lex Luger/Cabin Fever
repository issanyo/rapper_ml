Golf Hat
Black Vans
Whipping through Gotham with the track's bass higher than khalifa man
I'm in my basement while you lookin for some pussy, cat scan
For real, ain't nobody about to call me out this year
Y'all a bunch of jokers, I really make the pencil dissapear
Speaking of the Dark Knight
I know the Joker's scheme
Because I'm about to blow up something sick like the opening scene
My 16's hot, you better give me some props
I'm feeling like B-Rabbit, the rest of y'all just Papa Doc
I got the juice like Chance but I'd never do my dude like Pac
Oh, Luke sucks, I guess you got it backwards like a night in Vegas where Biggie got shot
I don't think you get it, go look up my lyric sheet
Cause I murder words like they did something to me personally
Yo, the leather Vans on my feet
Keep my cypher complete
They diss it but style, they straight jacket (jack-it) like mental institutions
I mean, who isn't a rapper nowadays?
This is just my 2 cents
I'm going to be a nuisance
Cause with thus rap i got a new sense
To prove shit to anybody who listen
(Yeah, Bitch)
Saying Luke is dope is like saying water's wet, society lacks common sense
Wiz Khalifa's high, gang bangers don't bring super soakers to drive bys
The sky is blue, and Rick Ross likes food
My flow's (flo) improved, I put a rug over it
I said my flow is tighter
I can do with 16 bars
What you can do in one whole cypher
I wanted to put the lighter sound at the beginning
But my mom wouldn't let me borrow a lighter
I'm about to conquer from Boston to Compton
Just by scribbling this nonsense
I said I scribble nonsensical
I been rapping since I was the number of squidward's tentacles
Just an adolecent degenerate
Grabbing up on his genitals
Say what you want but you can't say I'm not lyrical
And I got enough material
To make your shit seem wack
And mine's sicker than venereal
Yeah you rap but you don't want to put in the work
You scared to jump in a cypher
I be all up on it first
And leave every rapper going after me in a hearse
You better rap genius this verse
Cause man this shit's diverse
I'm sorry but the next song you play I promise it gets worse
(hahaha)
