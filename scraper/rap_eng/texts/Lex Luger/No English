[Intro: Travis Scott]
Don't know no English
Don't know no English

[Hook: Travis Scott]
Party today 'til tomorrow, 'til we don't know no English
හෑමදෙයක්ම විදේශඊ
Models, talkin' to models, and they don't know no English
අපි කොහෙද ඉන්නෙ?
Took that bitch out of state, where they don't know no English
අපි හෑම රටක්මට යනවා
My nigga just got back from the case, cause he spoke no, no English
අපි කොහෙද යන්නෙ තත්තෙ?


[Verse 1: Juicy J]
(Travis Scott, niggas out here talking that Brokanese, mane
We don't understand none of that shit)
A nigga been wildin' all night, mixin' that dark with the light
Fuck around, took a nigga bitch, now a nigga wanna start a fight
Nigga wanna take me out the zone
Workin' out, that's strong
I told a chick, hop in the whip
Let me know if she wanna let me hit it before I make it home
And shawty ain't nothin' but a freak
She been poppin' that pussy all week
She wanna let me hit in the backseat
It don't matter if she a freak in the streets, my sheets
She don't even know what I mean
When I say she gotta do it  for the team
Lean lean, won't do it for the Gram, she'll do it for the green
Nah mean? Ching ching!
My plug don't speak no English
And my weed is Jamaican
In Miami with Haitians, my shooters got no patience
I just got me two ladies, they get high and get naked
Shoot it all in their faces, swear to God this shit crazy

[Hook: Travis Scott]
Party today 'til tomorrow, 'til we don't know no English
හෑමදෙයක්ම විදේශඊ
Models, talkin' to models, and they don't know no English
අපි කොහෙද ඉන්නෙ?
Took that bitch out of state, where they don't know no English

My nigga just got back from the case, cause he spoke no, no English
අපි කොහෙද යන්නෙ තත්තෙ?

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
My nigga got caught with the birds
Bet the nigga never say a word
He was like,"no habla Inglés"
Nigga, I don't give a fuck what you heard
I ain't gotta pay for the Act
Got a chick in the back of the pharmacy with the syrup
Bitch, I'm a vet for the check
I had these hoes lined up, like the 1st and the 3rd
I can count a 100K in day, count a mill twice, double up at night
Nigga say, "ain't got all my dope"
Nigga, better go somewhere, get it right
Bitch, you better go somwhere, get a light
Thirsty ass bitch tryna get this ice
Lame ass bitch tryna jack my Rollie
Bitch couldn't see me even on Skype
Kobe and Shaq all in my Sprite
Whisky, Champagne coming in all night
Nigga I'm good, you can't comprehend
I'm tired of givin' broke ass niggas advice
I'm on my way overseas, I'm countin' G's 'til I land
I speak money, no translator, bet the bank understand

[Hook: Travis Scott]
Party today 'til tomorrow, 'til we don't know no English
හෑමදෙයක්ම විදේශඊ
Models, talkin' to models, and they don't know no English
අපි කොහෙද ඉන්නෙ?
Took that bitch out of state, where they don't know no English
අපි හෑම රටක්මට යනවා
My nigga just got back from the case, cause he spoke no, no English
අපි කොහෙද යන්නෙ තත්තෙ?


[Outro: Travis Scott & Juicy J]
(Straight up)
Don't know no English
You know it (Straight up)
Don't know no English (Straight up)
Don't know no English
Must be nice (Straight up)
Let's get it
Don't know no English
