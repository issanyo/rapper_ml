Chorus[2x]
Heavy traptivity, little on the lyricses
Catch me in the kitchen and young juice is doing chemistry
Long live the kingpin, ballin wit them bricks
Long live the kingpin, ballin wit them bricks

Verse
Long live the kingpin, ballin wit them bricks
Its been a long time comin, alot of years of sellin bricks
I done ran alot of traps, cuz im out there gettin rich
And my wrist like a motor, cuz its extra stackin chips
And my pockets like some ruffles, cheddar sour cream chips
And im workin like a hound, and my left wrist like da dip
With dis kingpin status gotcho bitch up on my dick
And i get her to the pad and i exersise her lips
And I pass her back to you and let you lick between her hips
While im 93 blowin, pull up on me going bricks
Its Young Juice Man kingpin status bitch
Young Juice Man kingpin status bitch

Chorus[2x]
Heavy traptivity, little on the lyricses
Catch me in the kitchen and young juice is doing chemistry
Long live the kingpin, ballin wit them bricks
Long live the kingpin, ballin wit them bricks

Verse
Heavy traptivity, little on the lyricses
Bet your bottom dolla Young Juice hot like some ?
And Im working wit them bricks, trap house like monopoly
Swang my front door, and its doing triganometry
Big ass Diamond chain on, like a Geo-ologist
And im from bouldercrest, check out my philosophy
Everythang orignal, these suckers try to copy me
I keep it to 1 hunna, and they do they shit sloppily
Kingpin status, got it on top where heaven be
Cocaine turned, got it lookin like a spellin bee
Young Juice Man, godamn kinpin
Kingpin status gettin them bricks in

Chorus[2x]
Heavy traptivity, little on the lyricses
Catch me in the kitchen and young juice is doing chemistry
Long live the kingpin, ballin wit them bricks
Long live the kingpin, ballin wit them bricks
