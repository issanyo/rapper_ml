[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Record labels fighting over me, they say a young nigga hot
Smoking kush, writing raps till a nigga pop
Gang bang, selling weed made my face hot
Waka out the pot, you can call him Straight Drop
Gucci said: "Little bro, you can fucking do it
If I drop a half a million, can you bring three back?"
We got money to the ceiling, talking stacks on stacks
Mizay, Brick Squad got a young nigga back
Like Shaq, these fuck niggas washed up
That ain't swag you got; you just acting, bruh
This ain't hip-hop, you can call it "gangsta hop"
In the hood, Waka Flocka got the soda pop

[Hook: Chaise & Waka Flocka Flame]
Waka Flocka, Waka Flocka
Waka Flocka
Waka Flocka Flame
Waka Flocka, Waka Flocka
Waka Flocka
Waka Flocka Flame

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Tunnel vision, tunnel vision, Lord knows I got tunnel vision
I can't hear shit, nigga
You can't tell me shit, nigga
Tunnel vision, tunnel vision, Lord knows I got tunnel vision
Catch me on your television
Watching how a nigga living
Yeah, I got your bitch and she laying on the pillow
She said she don't smoke, but I got her blowing indo
She said she like the way I smile and how a nigga thug
And when I hit the club, all I do is mean mug

[Hook: Chaise & Waka Flocka Flame]
Waka Flocka, Waka Flocka
Waka Flocka
Waka Flocka Flame
Waka Flocka, Waka Flocka
Waka Flocka
Waka Flocka Flame

[Verse 3: Cash Marie]
I hold my nigga's rock, so he call me his rock star
I hold my nigga's pistol, so he call me his pop star
I run with his weed, so he call me his block girl
Plot girl, fly girl, you can call me Cash, girl
I'm sexy from head to toe, got bitches on my left and right
We super deep up here tonight
S.I.G., we gon' fight
S.I.G., we gon' fight, this hoe buck, they gon' die tonight
S.I.G., we gon' fight, this hoe buck, they gon' lose they life

[Hook: Chaise & Waka Flocka Flame]
Waka Flocka, Waka Flocka
