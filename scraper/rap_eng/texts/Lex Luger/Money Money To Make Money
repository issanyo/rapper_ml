[Hook]
I make money, make money
That's what I hustle for?
You don' think the same thing
Tell me what you hustlin' for
If you ain' gon' shoot it
Nigga what you strapped for?
You ain' trynna leave the gutta
Nigga what you trappin' for?
I make money, make money, make money, make money(x4)

[Verse]
The more I work, the more I flip
The more I smoke, the more I trip
The more I trip, the more I work
The more I work, you hit me mo' bitchh
Killin' any nigga Jack the Rippa'
Jacket zippa' zipped up
Money get a inch tuck
Third eye open, for these niggas scopin'
Rats want my cheese but that 44 is poison
I'm a rapper but my gangsta ways still remain
I keep cash money, you niggas keep the change
First class life, nothin' less than better
Yo bitch head is the best, but her pussy wetter
Top flight smokin', I keep them red eyes
My money in the street, fuck fade highs

[Hook]
