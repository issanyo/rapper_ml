[DKnight]

[Verse 1]
I want the made life every night and this is how i get it
Young nigga go bezerk on music my shots never missing
I can talk about the fake ones or i can get to dissing fake ones
Cause im all work made life is my mission and i finish
DKnight that's the name and its something y'all need to remember
Like a Lil Wayne or Drizzy Drake i rap just like a killer
Nigga smoking cut the timber
Yea im sick on the beat no fever
On all honest truth i do what i do for the multi million
Yea so here we go i pass that shit and hit it slow
And im killin this beat but this is me and y'all should know
Star trek high and that's for sure
Glassy eyes and still want more
One day I'mma make it there then my glassy eyes gon turn gold
[yea i got it i got it and it ain't nothing new about it
If u want me on your team holla im just moving mountains]x2
Moving mountains all day moving mountains my way
Everything gon go my way in this made life that's how i play
Nigga do it all just like i say cutting lines to the top just like blade blade
This is me and the game i crave nigga gon do it all and get that pay
Yea ballin just honest the women i see always the finest
Im just poppin bottles to my music knowing im the brightest
DKnight gon be the hottest nah i ain't lying im just being honest
Got two chains on and just like him there ain't no stopping boy
I want he made life and we be on that made flight
Sipping till its daylight and we be crunk on every night
Chilling like its a Friday and we been past the height
Im smoking like its a holiday lets watch them flashing lights
Yea im doing this up on my grind cause i ain't got to much time
Makin moneys always been mine yea im doing fine
Live all night right im just killing trying get whats mine
You know a young nigga on his grind just a young nigga hustling pennies, nickles, dimes
Here i go G money was my hype man for sure
He was the first nigga to have my back and never gave a fuck about a ho
But now im in it without my boy im killing niggas that's trying be foes
Ain't no friends in life they don't know loyal and that shit there i know
Smoke all night yea im [gone]x2
Made life is my [goal]x2
Niggas want some [more]x2
So I'mma finish blowed throwed
Live right is my mission if you in the way you get burnt like coal
So just stay outta my way and watch a real nigga do it like its all i know
Ho split roll we all have some times
Yea im on it rolling smoking DKnight popping like some nines
Yea im killing on my grind wish my life had a rewind
Cause all the shit i been through probably have another nigga crying
Yea i know these niggas be lying
How i kill there ain't no tieing
If you hate me ain't no denying
Fuck you ill give you the sign
Im just jogging through these courses
Winning races without horses
If you know me nigga the you know i eat rappers up like hostas
Im the coldest nigga and you the only nigga
To beat me you'll have to kill me like you own the picture
Cause i want that made life and yes i am a dreamer
To live my dream ill have to build my name like king czar
Yea i kill overall there ain't no fall
So hopefully y'all will remember me like i remember y'all
DKnight's who to call because im about to ball
Mix-tape coming soon nigga listen to it all DKnight
