[Verse 1: AK]
All my niggas prophets so stop it with all the nonsense
I got this
I cop a 8th and clear the case like I was Cochran
Partner, the pot ablaze
Take the problems out my days
A 100k for the feature if we ain't on the same page
Break away from what they teach you
Society full of secrets
My diary the higher me
Let fire leak through your speakers
Entirely here to lead ya
The higher learning like Jesus
Fuck bitches from different regions
Have all of my brothers eatin', nigga

[Verse 2: Issa Gold]
Hold up nigga get your education
Enter in the game if you're trying to change it
Schoolin' these niggas, teach 'em all the basics
Like food in jail, niggas forced to take it
Nah, but I don't fuck with the blow
Spittin' prophecy but disguised with the flow
Enlighten and hope
Christ at the show
Now I pipe in the dough, and I syphon the dro
Im out here to win, poor niggas ya'll better make your moves
Team filled up with kings don't bang with court jesters, those is fools
Payin' dues
Beast coast be them niggas out here makin' moves
Ridin' through
Sittin' shotgun my Nefertiti's coupe

[Hook: Issa Gold]
All my niggas prophets
I ain't even gotta lie
Chillin in the solar, while y'all aimin' for the sky
Doobie thick, you can't hit my shit
Pop a tab, get lit
Who you with, your girl with the shits
Let her roll my spliff
Now we blowin' good smoke
UA you know we gon' blow
I said, I spit knowledge flows
And fuck it up at the shows
You know that golden soul the shit
No ice on my wrist still shining bitch
Golden soul the shit
No ice on my wrist still shining bitch

[Verse 3: Issa Gold]
People talk a lot of shit but they don't know my heart
Spread love, do drugs, and say a prayer for those in the dark
Black skin, gold soul
Im teachin' niggas how to play they part
Can't pave the way, but I can show you where you need to start
Follow your dreams, create, your world it's your reality
Uplift your shit, don't care if they question your sanity
So gone I'm bent
You know what I represent
I put it down for my set
That indigo medicine

[Verse 4: AK]
As we cross these borders I pray that our conscience guard us
The god in the sky is father
They harboring for fore fathers
Crib, laid back, with the largest blunt
Next day over seas, tryna turn shit up
Ain't a thing a young king can't overcome on that potent skunk
Make ya hold your lungs
UA sabotage the game, recognize the name uh
Niggas stereotype, but deep inside we're all the same
But where are the ones to blame
Gain a little knowledge, grow your brain
Watch you rise to the top
To the promise land that Martin dreamed

[Hook: Issa Gold]
All my niggas prophets
I ain't even gotta lie
Chillin in the solar, while y'all aimin' for the sky
Doobie thick, you can't hit my shit
Pop a tab get lit
Who you with, your girl with the shits
Let her roll my spliff
Now we blowin' good smoke
UA you know we gon' blow
I said, I spit knowledge flows
And fuck it up at the shows
You know that golden soul the shit
No ice on my wrist still shining bitch
Golden soul the shit
No ice on my wrist still shining bitch
