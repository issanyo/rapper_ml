[Verse 1]
I feel ya bro, niggas gotta sell
Due to survive, fuck everything else
Go and get you bread, I would get it too
Do your own shit, make to break your news
200 racks for the lamb
Anything that you want, you should have
And if niggas ain't talking no money, you should pass
And you should tell them horse looking bitches kiss my ass
We chasing models
In the hood you the plug, money coming fast
22 new crib feds watching that
Young nigga movement bigger than stars
[?]

[Hook]
The white girl on the track, she got me feeling like a pimp
How she bring the money back
I put the white girl on the track, she got me feeling like a pimp
How she bring that money back
All the trappers tryna get her
All the junkies wanna hit her
I'm dope boy pimping, I'm the only one that's with her
All the trappers tryna get her
All the junkies wanna hit her
I'm the only one that's with her

[Verse 2]
If he yo friend, why did he turn you in
I guess he chose the streets instead of the federal pen
You know what to do bruh, outside his house 9am
Taking his kids to school, blast em
Young niggas I chill with live a day at a time
Some niggas tryna grind, some don't even try
Some nigga put a cross on one of yo guys
Had to ride down on the boy, what a surprise
Nigga deep in the charger, [?]
That boy a fool, he couldn't figure it out
[?]

The white girl on the track, she got me feeling like a pimp

I put the white girl on the track, she got me feeling like a pimp
How she bring that money back
All the trappers tryna get her
All the junkies wanna hit her
I'm dope boy pimping, I'm the only one that's with her
All the trappers tryna get her
All the junkies wanna hit her
I'm the only one that's with her
