[Hook: Fredo Santana]x2
No sleep, 24 hours, that's that clockwork
On the grind every day, that's that clockwork
Can't stop, keep goin', that's that clockwork
That's that clockwork, that's that clockwork

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Go all the way back when I was a young nigga
Got my first pack, fell in love with drug dealin'
I was hungry and thirsty, and I'm still is
That's why I grind hard like I got six kids
New car, new house, that's what them bricks did
New jewelry, new kicks, what them licks did
I was born fucked up, wasn't a rich kid
Just a young hustler, that know how to flip shit
When that work come in tan like Bisquick
That's when you know you got some strong A1 shit
When that work come in tan like Bisquick
That's when you know you got some strong A1 shit

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Six o'clock, jammin' bags, that's that clockwork
M.O.B., fuck a bitch, I put the block first
In the trap, fuck a job, that's where I work
On that eight, pushin' weight til' my arms hurt
And this bezel on my wrist, it makes my arms hurt
No conversation, I got this 30 I'mma spark first
Hittin' off this AK, took an old bitch, gotta catch my guard first
Niggas want me dead but Duwop gon' blow, we just hope this Glock work
Now back on the block, tryna get this gwap, nigga that's that clockwork
Roll up in them cars, tryna slide on the Opps, nigga that's that clockwork
And you better not snooze when we pull up on you, better hope that clock work
My niggas pullin' 24's, ride tinted windows, 50 shots in them choppers
