[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Grove Street
Flocka

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottles keep popping, that's why the bad hoes jocking
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Roll up the loud, I'm trying to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I stepped in the club, rolling up that loud shit
My weed keep your security saying, "Be quiet"
My bread just start a riot, the girls get excited
Hold on, want to try it? I'm like, "Why not try it?"
My swag, they want to buy it, my juice, they want to try it
Club going stupid, when I O Let's Do It
Jewelry got her chewing, jugging and she moving
Grove Street villain, nigga, who you killing?
Broke two years ago, now I'm worth a million
Jacksons to the ceiling, that's how we balling
You know that I'm rolling, throwing up a mean bag
Now I'm off the meter, in the club with a heater

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottles keep popping, that's why the bad hoes jocking
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Roll up the loud, I'm trying to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party

[Verse 2: Kebo Gotti]
A party ain't a party till I walk in it
Lime green flag match the fitted and the linen
Gucci shades are on my face and my lens kind of tinted
'Cause my eyes real low and my head just started spinning
I'm rolling like a motherfucker, I'ma roll out in this motherfucker
On my Roscoe Dash shit, I'm 'bout to show out in this motherfucker
My jewelry game on frost, about to snow out in this motherfucker
Ay, Flocka, get them burners, let's pull out in this motherfucker
Ay, motherfucker, what the hell is you rocking for?
Run up on me and my squad, now that shouldn't be an option, so
Somebody better let him know, I suggest that you let it go
This is Grove Street party, safe niggas, hit the exit door

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottles keep popping, that's why the bad hoes jocking
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Roll up the loud, I'm trying to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Rolling off them beans, you can do the lean
Blowing on that loud purp, pass that Bobby Brown back
The hood got my fucking back, the streets, I'm not ducking that
Please step the fuck back, Grove Street, yes, we are back
Hood plus I'm nigga rich, every ghetto feeling this
20 on my right wrist, 30 on my left wrist
100 on my neck, I'll die for my respect
20-fucking-10, I'ma blow the whole check
In the club, flex, after party, flex
You know how we ball, all I know is ball
Every dollar in my pocket, I'ma spend it all
When a nigga die, they gon' say shawty raw

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottles keep popping, that's why the bad hoes jocking
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Roll up the loud, I'm trying to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
