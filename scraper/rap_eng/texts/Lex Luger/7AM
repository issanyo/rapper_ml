[Intro: Uzi & Brittany]
Now, I don't think it's just the drugs talking, but
I really think this shit gon' work
What you think?
Um, I don't know, it might
Man, I'm tired as fuck
But anyways, um
Did you see that video, on Instagram?
Man, what video?
It had me dying
But yeah
Don't think I didn't see your Chanel shoes
Man, them shit's horrible
Hey, hey I think it'll work!
Did you fall asleep? Uzi!
Of course its gon' work
And what a lovely morning
(alarm clock)
Uzi, wake your ass up

Ayy
I told that bitch I count my cake, bitch, get out my face
45 on my waist, boy, get out my way (DP on the beat)
Goyard on my waist, boy, you ain't got taste
Now I'm getting cake, now your bitch gon' let me

[Chorus]
Like oh god damn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh god damn, diamonds all on my fronts
Like 7 AM, I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch
Like oh god damn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh god damn, diamonds all on my fronts
Like 7 AM, I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch
Like oh god damn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh god damn, diamonds all on my fronts
Like 7 AM, I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch

[Verse 1]
Like I lost a lot of friends, but who give a fuck?
I got the money, now that's all that I want
She ate me for lunch (yeah), feel like 2Pac, I'm a thug (oh yeah)
Know some Crips and Bloods
Xannies, brought them drugs (oh yeah)
Got a lot of people banking on me (yeah)
Tell me why these niggas always hating on me (oh yeah)
Coming home, they be waiting on me
Like, jump off my dick, all that faking homie

[Chorus]
Like oh god damn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh god damn, diamonds all on my fronts
Like 7 AM, I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch
Like oh god damn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh god damn, diamonds all on my fronts
Like 7 AM, I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch

[Verse 2]
Like, fuck nigga, like, can you leave me 'lone?
Made a million by myself, yeah, that be my song
Like, yeah, I rock designer when I'm in my zone
Yeah, I fucked your mama, I'm on my VLONE
Said I'm higher than a drone, boy, you is my clone
Your mama a crackhead, I sold that bitch some stones
Now these bitches want me, I feel like I'm Mike Jones
281 330 8004
Catch me lean spilling while I'm lane switching
Drop the top, cocaine ceiling
Backwood, propane pilling
Say my name in it, now your chain missing (Lil Uzi)
Had a lot of friends and a lot of homies
Now I'm higher, now they all salty
Tell them niggas get the fuck up off me
Now I'm higher, now they all salty

[Chorus]
Like oh god damn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh god damn, diamonds all on my fronts
Like 7 AM, I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch
Like oh god damn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh god damn, diamonds all on my fronts
Like 7 AM, I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch, ayy
