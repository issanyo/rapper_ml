[Verse 1]
Seemed like it was just yesterday
We was stealing cars flipping Escalades
I started selling pounds around eleventh grade
It might be off a gram or two cause nigga we don't measure weight
Rule number one: you pull yo gun don't hesitate
But I don't have to shoot no mo' I let my German Shepard spray
My Glock 40 black and my beretta gray
I sold my first split over there by where Coretta stay
I had them quarter pounders, I ain't talking burgers
Mid in the freezer right next to that cart of sherbert
I seen my partner shoot a nigga twice and toss the burner
But I can't say too much I'll fuck around and solve a murder
Yea I'm from the streets, but I don't talk about it
My homies worth a couple mill and that's just off exotics
I rather be caught with this pistol than to be caught without it
I sold enough green to fill the fucking Boston Garden

[Hook]
So don't try me shawty
I ain't that far removed [x3]
A hundred pounds in a week, that ain't that hard to use
I ain't that far removed [x6]
My daddy drove my truck and fucked around and found my tool
I ain't that far removed [x2]

[Verse 2]
I'm the real life Calogero
Bronx Tale but I ain't never told befo'
Like I ain't took them things up the road befo'
Listen cowboy, this ain't my first rodeo
We had so much produce from Cali nigga
You gotta weigh it with the scales in the grocery sto'
Yeen gettin' no bread if the feds ain't got yo portfolio
Woo! I almost caught the Holy Ghost
You think I'm bullshittin', nigga I'm up here pulpittin'
Looking out for them stool pigeons cause y'all niggas think it's cool snitchin
Shit I know some folks who know some folks
They thought I was a conscious rapper cause I ain't take the dope approach
That's cause I know some folks that tote the toast
That's close to blow that move that Cosa Nostra coke from coast to coast
I just said some shit you wasn't s'posed to know
When you in this deep, you gotta hold ya nose
Even Jehovah know

[Hook]
