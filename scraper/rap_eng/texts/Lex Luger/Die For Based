[Intro]
Red Flame
You know I got that anger in my motherfuckin' heart
Based legends, pro-based
BasedWorld stand up
Based demigods, pro-based
Based prophets, based noblemen
BasedWorld stand up
Lil B in this motherfucker
If you don't give a fuck, throw your middle fingers up, this is Red Flame bitch, for life

[Verse 1: Lil B]
I'mma die for this motherfuckin' based shit
Fuckin' models in they ass cause they ain't shit
And that bitch fuckin' with me
Bought a little head and it cost two-fifty
Young BasedGod nigga, swag of the century
Young BasedGod with the limousine tints
Young BasedGod make that ho suck my dick
Iced out wrists ho, you know I'm with the shit
Your ho call me a bitch, I call that girl a fag
I'm a pretty bitch, I fucked her in her ass
Barbara Walters swag with that AK-47
Shoot a fuckin' cat cause all dogs go to heaven
Word around town BasedGod from the seven
Word around town, yeah, I bought a MAC-11
Word around town that every bitch jock me
Iced out ring, thirty carat chain
Ten grand show, twenty carat ring
Five on my dick nigga, twenty on my name
Ask a young ho about young BasedGod
She tell you that I'm rich and I stroke like A-Rod
Thirty on my nuts, bitch I'm going to the top
A hundred on my dick bitch I will never stop
BasedGod nigga
