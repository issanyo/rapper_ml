[Intro]

Money to be made and I'mma spend it all
Keep 3 hoes (uhn) bowling balls
I got 3 hoes, call me Santa Claus
No dental plan but bitch I floss
Get your dentals flossed
Same wack rappers, just a different day
Hope they all Kobe Bryant, fade away
Where the dice, I'm tryna shoot somethin', AK
And if I did this song, this probably what i'd say

(Chorus)

G Star, Rugby
Hugo, BOSS (BOSS)
G Star, Rugby
Hugo, BOSS (BOSS)
Hugo, BOSS
Hugo, BOSS
Broke niggas don't get paid on this boulevard

[Verse]

Killin' all these niggas
I shoot but I dont take pictures
That yellow nigga with them yellow earrings
And all about that skrilla
Mister ride on E and I dont worry about no fill up
I dont fuck with them niggas
I carry the load, 18 wheelers
Bitches still be stalkin'
Asking me where I been
I'm on the other line but can't duck 'em
Shout out to Verizon (UHN)
About to get me a ringback tone
DMV what I put on
At them niggas necks
And you ain't there
You just a collar bone
Where the fuck I been
Bad bitches where my dick go in
And I just got that Auto-Tune
So I'mma stop rapping (UHN)

[In Auto-tune]
Killing all these niggas
I shoot but I dont take pictures
That yellow nigga with them yellow earrings
And all about that skrilla!!

Same wack rappers, just a different day
Hope they all Kobe Bryant, fade away
Where the dice, I'm tryna shoot somethin', AK
And if I did this song, this probably what i'd say

(Chorus)

G Star, Rugby
Hugo, BOSS (BOSS)
G Star, Rugby
Hugo, BOSS (BOSS)
Hugo, BOSS
Hugo, BOSS
Broke niggas don't get paid on this boulevard
