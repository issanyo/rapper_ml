[Hook]
I gotta get some weed every morning just to medicate
Codeine for lunch, make a nigga have a laker face
Purple, dirty Sprite, drank, Juicy get a better rate
If I got twenty beans, nineteen I'ma take
So damn fucked up, I don't give a damn, bruh [x2]

[Verse 1]
I'm chugging lean, taking beans, I do all kinds of things
I got three chicks in my room, I'm just like Charlie Sheen
I keep that Henny and Ciroc on deck by any means
Cigarillos and weed, what kind? Blue dream
I feel like I'm on a roller coaster, I ain't never stop it
Loritabs, Vicodin, and Xanax, I keep it popping
All the chicks got naked, I was like, hold up a second
Let me put a rubber on so tommorow I won't regret it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, GHB, marijuana
You can do it if you wanna
I mix up three different kind of weeds, I call it Osama
Wild like a young nigga living with his momma
Geeked up, playing Xbox all day
They don't go to school, they don't have a job, but they paid
They stay fresh, got the latest pair of Jays
Riding in the Charger, wanging bass, trippy mane

[Hook]
