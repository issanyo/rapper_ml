[Verse]
I stroll up your block, I go where I wanna
I look like a baller, I talk like a owner
Shoot for the stars, shoot up the corner
Black Bel Air bottle, bust 'em like a Corona
Nigga mean with the rock, blow trout in the lot
Heidi Klum and my neighbors, sippin' ciroc with Barack
Blonde bitch is the bomb, she know I'm a threat
A nigga rich as Saddam, just build a house in Tebet
It's that dog food nigga, know I'm killin' the bitch
It's that Alpo talk, you getting kibble and bits
They talkin' fed time now, they send us in quick
You in your bed tied down, you on some menacing shit
Timberland boots, black trench coat
Kept on all of my chains, cuz this game cutthroat
Niggas wanna be weasels, till they put in the yoke
Snatch you out your Evisu's, walk through the city of dope
Got a few watches, got some shit up my sleeve
Got you bitch in the Lamborghini, she barley can breathe
I don't know her name, I call her passenger seat
All I want is her brain, so fuck her master degree
I ball like I'm Maly, ball like I'm Wade
Ball like I'm 'Bron, I like the lobster filet
My obsession is hoes, stone crabs outta Joes
I can make one wish, murder all of my foes
Shades cost 10, my car: half a mil
They say I'm the man, shawty low know it real
We keep the cash in the back, keep them guns in the front
You know just where we at, so you can come when you want
I fill my cut to the top, whether purple or not
My bitch look like Toni Braxton, from you makin' me hot
Throw the white in the pot, my future look bright
Did my wrongs in the dark, long as that paper look right
It's that dog food nigga, it's that Al Poe top
I can jump off a jet, and go jump straight in the water
If there's beef then there's beef, they can't sleep on me
My dogs dressed like ninjas, [?] the rice on me
Life is a gamble, I'm so mean with the dice
Head crack with the left, I'm hitting trips with right
I'm in that bitch, bitch I'm on fire
I'm in that bitch, I'm on fire, bitch I'm on fire
It's the dog food, let my dogs eat
No, she a dog, bitch, I let my dog beat
I'm in my dogs Bens, and had it all week
I'm sippin' Bel AIr, I'm tryna drown me
So fuck the rap game, they tried to down me
I'm still strapped mayne, it's dade county
If you a fuck boy, stay the fuck from 'round me
If you a fuck boy, stay the fuck from 'round me
Stones in my pocket, stone washed jeans
Label the Mastermind my, elaborate schemes
They say I'm a eclectic, because I gotta prefect it
Take 200 racks just the "huh" on your racket
It's the dog food let my dogs eat
I got 50Ms, I'm talkin' straight cheese
50Ms, I'm talkin' straight cheese
