[Hook: David Blayne & Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Picked it up and shot a nigga (by myself)
Smoke weed, drink good (by myself)
Fuck hoes, ball hard (by myself)
I don't need them new bags (by myself)
Lex Luger on the track, that's good for my health
Put a nigga on the shelf, I'm So Icey like a elf
Twenty bands on weed? (Did it by myself)
Salute me or just shoot me? (Did it by myself)
I don't need no help, got juice like Welch
All this pain that I felt, narcotics I dealt
Did it by myself
Did it by myself
This the last draw, so I gotta get it in
Lord, please help me, got my hands all in
I promised to my momma that the streets won't win
Brick Squad shawty, I'ma ride till the end

[Hook: David Blayne & Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I know y'all hear this all the time, thoughts running through my mind
Haters, keep them behind, don't let them block my grind
Give a fuck about shining
I said I give a fuck about shining
Everywhere from the heart, Waka Flocka, where to start?
I lost my little brother, we used to kick it like martial arts
Daddy and my uncle died on the same day
Ever since then, hard work, no play
Where the fuck I stay? Clayton County, Riverdale
Middle finger to the twelve, give a fuck about jail
I'ma try and bust bells and sell cocaine
But these niggas wanna tell, why the fuck they acting lame?
Still the same nigga, hanging with the same clique
Clayco trying to ban me like Atlanta did Vick
I don't give a fuck, shawty, I'ma stay on my shit
Last time I checked, Waka Flocka Flame the shit

[Hook: David Blayne & Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)
I'm all I got (I'm all I got)

[Outro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Rah Rah, man, you know...
Man, you know that shit we was talking 'bout, nigga
You know, me and you, man
I think, I think I'ma take the family up through there, man
We rich, man
This to my daddy to my uncle, man
I love y'all, man
God bless the dead, man
Travis Scott, man, I love you bro
God bless the dead, man
Stepdaddy Red, man
Damn, fuck, Flocka
