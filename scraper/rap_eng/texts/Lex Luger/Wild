You know I'm from New Orleans (know what it is)
The home of the stunnahs ([?] what it is boy)
I usually don’t partake in this type of activity (uptown what it is)
But I gotta do it at least once

[Hook]
Got the [?] on my [?] yo, [?] on my classy
Bitch I’m from the N.O., you know that I been doubted
Got VIP so crowded, they smokin’ on that loud shit
Na’tee, BMB, it’s wild when they play my shit

[Verse 1]
Man, I ain’t worrying about these hoes
Bitch I’m ballin’ like D. Rose
My whole clique got [?], and my pockets as big as my ego
[?] Mo’Nique clothes
Making chips like freedos, ‘cus me and my amigos
Live [?] everyday like guidos
Whatever is right they [?]
[?] I’m in the lady’s coupe, windows up and [?]
Niggas [?] and my life is sweet, no [?]
Got a AK clip very long and a gun range behind every home, BANG!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got a few hard tops and a soft top
Front yard like a [?]
Closet like a gun show
And you niggas never [?] like a [?]
I pull up [?], niggas ya’ll drop
Which cause? Like Stevie J's [?] hoes
[?] parole in which rap niggas pose in front of Jaguars to the 6-4
[?] where a bitch go
Misplaced it, he’s missing like Casey, wait, he’s in a trunk like Caylee
[?], I thought it was a 80
Pull up and the niggas went crazy
I’m ballin’ like Jupiter [?]
[?] I’m making a flood in the club, I had a flashback to Katrina

[Hook]
