[Hook]
Like a car with no brakes man I can't stop
Making hits non-stop I'm rolling off a (yop?)
A lot of cuts in my wrist from these damn diamonds
All because my flow ( there?) like I been rhyming
They say who the fuck is next
I say Wooh Da Kid and Lex
No romancing baby girl yeah its time to have sex
They say who the fuck is next
I say Wooh Da kid and Lex
No romancing baby girl cuz its time to have sex

[Verse 1]
No slow dancing, no romancing when I'm in the club
44 on my side I'm a fucking thug
(This lil' nigga hating saying I'mma fucking scrub)
He throwing salt in the game so get a slug
I'm just tryna get some bitches chill and smoke a blunt
With my niggas throwing money cuz they love to flaunt
Brick Squad niggas built for the bullshit
Bully niggas getting beat with a full clip
Alot of bad bitches tryna be ya actress
The next scene is you laying on my mattress
Kareem Stephan status, she got that super head
No slow dance, romance, we get to the head

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Call me Wooh Billy Blanks I'm on hydro
I work ya girl out but I ain't talking Tae Bo
Face down ass up beat it from the back
She a freak so I slid a finger down the crack
Yes yes Wooh Da Kid the best
Lex a picky nigga, so he ain't hit it next
Fuck it I'mma throw this sheep to the wolves
Plus she down for it and she like her hair pulled
A-and she know the game, A-and how it goes
Yeh she smashed the homies, B-but she ain't a ho
She with the program, no romance
Keep ya hands down baby you have no chance

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Mixtape working, album work done
Wooh and Lex is like night and day
More like moon and sun
And together we gon' make the game go round and round
Because they love my flow and they love lil homie's sounds
Beat going hard, man I swear to god
A bunch of young niggas moving like a fucking mob
MGM niggas, straight cut-throat
Bring it in and back it up by the truck load
Dirt game killers, fetty game next
Lex Luger track so you know I had to flex
So Icey Boy for life we don't romance
And it's alot of dead guys screaming in my pants

[Hook]
