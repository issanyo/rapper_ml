Yeah, Rotten Kids

[Verse 1]
Its a new day, 20 and Im on a new wave
Imma get a crib up in the fucking himalays
All by myself with a couple pretty maids
And my homies still my homies from the fucking 6th grade
Lost a couple friends but a couple hundred made
Yeah, and i just wanna say
I been on the bench now its time for me to play
All she ever wanted was a fuckin real nigga
Take trips to Miami just to come and chill with ya
Skurt off to L.A, kick it with the trill bitches
Ridin through the bay with a couple real killas
And we all screaming

[Chorus]
One time for the east side
Two times for the southside
Westside thats the next side
Light it up until the rise

MIA, MIA, MIA, MIA
And imma do this shit forever
I Swear that Im commited
Plus Im thuggin homie that's the way I'm livin

[Verse 2]
Im just overseas pimpin, with some overseas women
Sippin on some Bombay at the Double Tree winnin uh
I been gifted since birth homie, Teolah stamped it in 94
Now I gotta blow, long money pronto
Young Kid with a big dream
These big dreams and these big shows
Hangin out with these with folks, getting throwed, all night
Man you know im in the city
Riding Uptown middle finger out the Bentley
Dirty South slang so my pants hang
Soulja Rag tied I Dont gangbang
I rock up towns homie cocaine
And all my homies on the same thing
Yeah Lets Go

[Chorus]
One time for the east side
Two times for the southside
Westside thats the next side
Light it up until the rise

MIA, MIA, MIA, MIA
And imma do this shit forever
I Swear that Im commited
Plus Im thuggin homie that's the way I'm livin

[Ending]
Cause Im thuggin homie thats the way im livin
Thats the way im living
Ooooooo (Singing)
