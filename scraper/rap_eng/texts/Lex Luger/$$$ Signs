[Hook]
Dollar signs in my eyes, all I see is money (x4)
All I see is money
Rubba bands (x4)
All I see is money
Rubba bands (x4)
All I see is money
Rubba bands (x4)
All I see is money
Rubba bands (x4)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Step out da car, rubber bands in my pocket
Rose gold Rolex look like it’s plugged in a socket
All the bad bitches lookin’, all the fuck niggas jockin’
People investigatin’ I’ll let the streets keep on talkin’
Got a brick in the trunk, you know I gotta get mine
Mama always said, “It’ll come in due time”
So I took what she said, flipped dat bitch a few times
Went and got a suburban and a new benz to ride
Then I loaded the sticks, I just wanna survive
A quarter’s going for six, you can get’em for five
The streets gotta demand, therefore I gotta supply
If you want it for cheap, oh man I got a surprise
I need them

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
If you got money in your pockets, stretch dem bands out
In Magic City, strippers call me Mr. Handout
I drink a lotta Rose, I help the brand out
I drive a Phantom, but don’t make me bring that Lamb out
All these rashes on my dick ‘cause my diamonds glistelin’
Man I get so much money, while you niggas penny pinch
A nigga like me don’t give a fuck about a price
I got a P Diddy swag and a Hugh Hefner life bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
You can hate me now, but I won’t stop now
I been stayin’ fly, way before the Stay Fly
And I be raining them dollars like Mayweather the boxer
And I been winning in Cali way before I won my Oscar
L-Livin in mansions, with all God’s blessings
I’m stackin up much taxes, you stackin up much textin'
A lot of people question my career choices I made
But I wouldn’t change a day, ‘cause every day I get paid

[Hook]
