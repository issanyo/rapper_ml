I get it quiick then I blow it fast
I’m acting brand new on yo hoe ass
Niggas hating on me like I got it fast
I been writing rhymes
Since you was in that 02 jag
Niggas mad at me I’m leaking swag
They be mad cause they
Bitches love to call me dad
10 chains 9 rings
She wanna grab at me
Issa knife you can
Try to take a stab at me
And don’t think that shit you said
Ain’t a jab at me
I’m just bobbin
And I’m weaving
Quit that crab nappin
Bottle rocket
Rocket launcher
You a frag magnet
All I do is show love
You be agg Cappin
Nigga better learn to dance
Like Charlie Chaplin
Fresh up out the slammer
Had it to make it happen
Bitch I’m MC Hammer
Parachutes trapping
Make the work disappear
Then we call it magic
Moment turned to tragic
Laying low for has beens
Ran a race and lapped him
Been about the action
Gripping just for traction
This is not a faction
Yo numbers not adding up
They must be subtracting
Know you out here acting
Known it like I mapped it
All my sons know they branded
Just like the Frat is
Boy you seen my steez
Like I’m mr freeze
Niggas know they falling victim
To that Ivy
Why you try me?
Go do high knees
While you at it take some
Lashes to yo hiney
You can cry to me
Don’t say bye to me
I thought I been told yo ass
You could fly with me
Watch me spread my wings
Soaring while I bleed
Just to show you
Not a thing not stopping me
You ain’t dropping me
Ion gotta breathe
Even in the after life
You can’t Fock with me
Invest stocks with me
Got some socks wit me
Staying fresh
To be a player
Bill Bellamy
Fuck a felony
What up Melanie
Okay bro you need to chill
That’s what they telling me
Ima show you how I feel
Just be real wit me
You better hope that you still got
Some steel wit me
Build a grill wit me
Still got chill wit me
Earth 🌏 colors
In my diamonds
Tell em ill wit me
Like I’m Will in scenes
Jordan brand my sneaks
Prince Still out Here Fresh
And I’m still a king 🤴🏾
Still got bills and things
Still gotta sing
Maybe I won’t die alone
If I kill some things
