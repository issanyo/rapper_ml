[Chorus: Slim Dunkin & Waka Flocka Flame]
Lights on, flex! Lights on, flex!
Just left the jewelry store, cut the lights on, hold it!!
Lights on, flex! Lights on, flex!
Rolling up the kush, roll it!
I need a light, homes, ugh!
Lights on, on! Lights on, on!
Men in Black Ray-Bans, lights on, flex!
Lights on, flex! Lights on, flex!
Tommy Stinson on who the lights on, flex!

[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin]
Dirtgang!
Men in Black Ray-Bans, spending ray bands
True Religion jeans, they my play pants
Niggas trying to turn up in my city
Dead bodies finna turn up in my city, man down!
Selling bags just like turnips in my city, squad!
On fire, finna burn up in my city
Look at me, I'm lit up, I done flipped the switch up
I ain't never switch up, Designer when I'm fit up, squad!
Better not mention Dunkin name unless you talking Tim
Snatch and grab something from Dunk? Must be talking rim
Diamonds flashing like neuralizers
Walking through Jurassic Park, need a tourist guidance

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin & Waka Flocka Flame]
Lights on, flex! Lights on, flex!
Just left the jewelry store, cut the lights on, hold it!!
Lights on, flex! Lights on, flex!
Rolling up the kush, roll it!
I need a light, homes, ugh!
Lights on, on! Lights on, on!
Men in Black Ray-Bans, lights on, flex!
Lights on, flex! Lights on, flex!
Tommy Stinson on who the lights on, flex!

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Heard these niggas trying to turn up in the city, Dunk (Where they at?!)
Empty clips have them dancing like they Diddy, Dunk (Pow, pow, pow, pow)
Sit them in the trunk just like some fifteens (Rrrghhh!)
AK-47, nickname it "Shoulder Lean" (Pow!)
I'm from Clayco, ain't no OG's (Riverdale!!)
Juug's, pocket [?] extendos [?] (Jurassic Park!)
Never ride drop tops, learned from Kennedy (Pow!)
100,000 on my neck, bet they notice me (Flex, flex flex!)
Real nigga right here, you just industry (You!)
Choir singing diamonds, call it Fuzzy Ministry (Go!)
I'm a millionaire menace to society (What's ha'nenin?!)
Mentally, I know they can't fuck with me (Ughh!)

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin & Waka Flocka Flame]
Lights on, flex! Lights on, flex!
Just left the jewelry store, cut the lights on, hold it!!
Lights on, flex! Lights on, flex!
Rolling up the kush, roll it!
I need a light, homes, ugh!
Lights on, on! Lights on, on!
Men in Black Ray-Bans, lights on, flex!
Lights on, flex! Lights on, flex!
Tommy Stinson on who the lights on, flex!

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Burrr, yeeah, burrr, yeaah, cheeea
Let me fuck her with the lights on
Such a silly motherfucker, all this ice on (Wahh, wow)
Yeah, it's true she might be with you for life long
But she thinking 'bout La Flare when she ride home
Yeah, Dunk gone and put me on the right zone (Right zone)
Big diamonds bigger than rhinestones (Burrr!)
When I say "burr", that's my theme song (Burrr?)
This a So Icey/Brick Squad singalong (Uh, yaah..)
Begging that Georgia Dome since I came home (Yaahh)
Got like 50 grand in hundreds in that Georgia Dome (Yaahh)
Spent a hundred bones on my ring alone (BLING!)
Going ham, Gucci in the fucking zone, cut the lights on (Yaahh, uhh)

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin & Waka Flocka Flame]
