Bitch

Bitch
Mane, I'm still trippy, I'mma always stay motherfucking trippy

[Hook]
Now we won't beef about nothing 'less money's involved
All we call is goons, never call the law
Now you get to meet a G, now you get to meet a G
Now you get to meet a G, now you get to meet a G (Let's go)
Paper over pussy, money over broads
We ain't athletic, but all we do is ball
Now you get to meet a G, now you get to meet a G
Now you get to meet a G, now you get to meet a G (Let's go)

[Verse 1]
I got 80 million dollars in the bank account, top that
20 cars in the garage, nigga top that
20 bitches want a bone, top that
Magic City, pulling strippers out my top hat
Whatever you want, Juicy can supply
Want to smoke on some dope? Juicy got that fire
Straight out of North Memphis, killers and pimping
We straight gangsta over here, ain't no Richard Simmons
The only Simmons that we talking about is them Russells
40 years in the game, million in them duffels
Forever stacking them chips, them bags are rufffles
Forever packing them clips, for rats and busters
If shit was money, then I'm full of shit
If money dirty, then I'm filthy rich
I'm the god father, you sons of a bitch
Keep running your mouth, I'm gon' run up in your bitch

[Hook]
Now we won't beef about nothing 'less money's involved
All we call is goons, never call the law
Now you get to meet a G, now you get to meet a G
Now you get to meet a G, now you get to meet a G (Let's go)
Paper over pussy, money over broads
We ain't athletic, but all we do is ball
Now you get to meet a G, now you get to meet a G
Now you get to meet a G, now you get to meet a G (Let's go)

[Verse 2]
I never took no hand outs, hustle on my own
Errthang I own, me and Miss Jones
Flying over seas in a G6
Bumping G6, money getting, Three 6
I got a big gun to cut you into pieces
Or I just might use my fist and leave you teethless
Fuck a forest fire, I keep the trees lit
Dom PÃ©rignon, european bitch
I don't fuck with beef, unless you want it
I done warned you, I got a army
You invited to a killer party, you on the guest list
Never personal, bitch

[Hook]
Now we won't beef about nothing 'less money's involved
All we call is goons, never call the law
Now you get to meet a G, now you get to meet a G
Now you get to meet a G, now you get to meet a G (Let's go)
Paper over pussy, money over broads
We ain't athletic, but all we do is ball
Now you get to meet a G, now you get to meet a G
Now you get to meet a G, now you get to meet a G (Let's go)

[Verse 3]
I am not Hollywood, but I smoke on holly good
Nigga still talking shit, tell their bitch to suck my dick
I got money, you got nothing, you see me, I be stunting
Four 15", I be bumping, no more room in my trunk
I keep hash in my blunt, test my gangsters, meet my pump
Niggas peeping out their window
Chevy smoked out from all that endo
Trying to get a bitch, looking for a straight nympfo
Looking for a new plug, let me get your info
