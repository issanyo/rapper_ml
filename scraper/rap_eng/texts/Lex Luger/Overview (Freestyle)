[Verse 1: Racks Hogan]


Ok is racks
I'm off that pack
Gpen I'm waxed
Man thas fact
I'm wit that strap
Can't turn my back
Cuz is haters
They watch you stunt
They watch you shine
Smile n yo face
But on the real they hate yo grind
Thats fasho
Im bout it ho
My niggas go
They let you know
That barrel glow
Turn you to ghost
Thats foreal
Stay bout your biz
Protect your crib
Them jackers come
Whip out that stick
Unload that clip
You wanna live like a gangsta
Best be ready for that gansta shit
Streets ain't got no pitty
Niggas shootin tryna take ya shit
Life is what you make it slick
I hope u tryna make it rich
Focused from the start
Never be the victim of a snitch
Left coast fuck wit cha
Midwest you knwo thats home
Rollin stone
Yeah I be gone
Pounds in gotta get em gone
I been trappin
U jus got on
Real shit you niggas clones
I'm copping bikes
You copping foams
I'm copping bapes
Cuz Jordan's old
Young nigga
Old soul
Front teeth
All gold
Black bag
And the cash cold
With the bank bands
Cuz it can't fold
