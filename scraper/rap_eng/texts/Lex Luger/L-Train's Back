Intro: Nikollaj Records, L-Train

[Verse 1]
L-Train's Back, L-Train's Back
All these rappers screamin’ that L-Train Back
Nikollaj Records flying high
Fuck the haters I could tell ‘em goodbye
I ain’t need anyone of them
I’m all about myself, call me Eminem
I’m back from the dead
Spillin’ ink on the paper like I’m outta lead

[Verse 2]
They screamin’, L-Train Back L-Train Back
I’m ridin’ shotgun in that all black ‘Lac
That young kids alive
Erryone want a high five
I’m on that good music shit, swerve
L-Train’s back, that’s the word
I’m what’s hot on the radio
I’m what everyone is sayin’ play me mo
Everyone wants to buy my shit
I’m like ye, I push miracle whips
I’m spittin’ through the wire
They say my flow is like the heat from fire
Nastiest thing bout my spittin’ is my flow
I’m a young rapper just like my boy J.Cole
I’m resurrecting the rap game
It was put to shame
By these lames like Lil’ B and Gucci Mane
I’m raps savior
Like a baby sitter watching these scrubs behavior
Now watch and learn from the best
It’s Nikollaj Records, fuck the rest

[Verse 3]
L-Train Back, L-Train Back
All these rappers screaming that L-Train Back
I’m screaming my old shits wack, my old shits wack
Now I’ve gotten better and I’m getting them racks
Ballin’ in Indy same as Gibbs
I ain’t no one hit wonder, like that rapper jibs
I’m back to takeova
Like my inspiration, Jay Hova
Hit em with the D.Rose
Like I’m in dressed in some G clothes

[Verse 4]
L-Train Back, L-Train Back
All these rappers saying that l-train back
I’m saying hop off my shit hop off my shit
Hop off my shit fo yo ass get kicked
Riding with tha cuz
Been hated now I get love
Been nothing in my city now I’m ridin on dubs
I resurrected
Now my buzz is as big as Texas
Give the mic to my big homie
And I’m the killa in my city no Montana, but Tony

[Verse 5]
Now I’m out now I’m out
Real shit, that’s what I’m bout
Shout out to my homies M.M.G
And I’m waiting for you scrubs to keep dissing me
L-train’s back!
It’s just the beginning
So let the tape keep spinning
