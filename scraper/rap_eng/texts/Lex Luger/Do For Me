[Hook]
Lot of money, lot of problems, shit ain’t new to me
Bitches in they feelings, say they through with me
Couple niggas hating, don’t know what to do with me
Bitch if I was down and out what would you do for me?
Got to live it when you speak this shit so fluently
Spend some hard-earned money on some jewelry
Couple niggas hating, don’t know what to do with me
Bitch if I was down and out what would you do for me?

[Verse 1]
Lately lot of people changing and I’m cool with it
It ain’t nothing, shit I’m comfy when my tool with me
Not the type that get the change and act a fool with it
I’m the type that get the change and make a move with it
I been in the same clothes for four days
Tryna get a bag and split it with my woadies
Man I started out with nothing, I was hungry
Had to stack a couple bands by my lonely
I don’t see the sneak dissing ‘cause I’m in the field
Really in it for my family, fuck how niggas feel
If you don’t know me you can’t manage me, let’s be for real
I don’t need a nigga’s plug or a record deal
You hate on me but want a plug on a record still
You tell your bitch to hate on me, she play my record still
See I’m the type of nigga pay to get the devil killed
They tellin’ me to slow it down, I’m on the pedal still

[Hook]
Lot of money, lot of problems, shit ain’t new to me
Bitches in they feelings, say they through with me
Couple niggas hating, don’t know what to do with me
Bitch if I was down and out what would you do for me?
Got to live it when you speak this shit so fluently
Spend some hard-earned money on some jewelry
Couple niggas hating, don’t know what to do with me
Bitch if I was down and out what would you do for me?

[Verse 2]
I’m just here to cut the check, fuck your feelings and how you feelin’
This ain’t ‘bout bitches and ain’t ‘bout niggas
This ‘bout learning how to maneuver and move through a cutthroat city
Used to be cool ‘til he couldn’t come up with me
Nobody told you blow your paper, that was your gut feeling
Shit, me I would’ve told you tuck it don’t spend it but niggas don’t listen
How could you hate me ‘cause I’m black six Benzing
Really I don’t get it
You should really think ‘bout making you something
It’s only two types of niggas, is you hating or hustling?
The hate ain’t ‘bout nothing, I’m telling you youngin
Don’t ever listen to another nigga tellin’ you to not get money
Nobody feeding you when you get hungry
And if that bitch around, focus on the play, don’t get too caught up and trusting
These bitches ain’t shit and these niggas ain’t nothing
When I was down and out my phone wasn’t ringing or buzzing
Then all of the sudden niggas know me
They my homies and cousins
Fuck outta here

[Hook]
Lot of money, lot of problems, shit ain’t new to me
Bitches in they feelings, say they through with me
Couple niggas hating, don’t know what to do with me
Bitch if I was down and out what would you do for me?
Got to live it when you speak this shit so fluently
Spend some hard-earned money on some jewelry
Couple niggas hating, don’t know what to do with me
Bitch if I was down and out what would you do for me?
