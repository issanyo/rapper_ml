[Chorus: OG Maco]
Boppin’ ass bitch
Naggin’ ho, little boppin’ ass bitch
Fuck ‘em, fuck ‘em, little boppin’ ass bitch
Naughty bitch, little boppin’ ass bitch

[Verse 1: Larry June]
These niggas bullshitting, politicking
Thirty rounds in the mini knock ‘em off
Before the rap game, had three foreign whips
Snow bunnies in the loft
Blend in with the scene
Young nigga been rich, yeen’ even know it
Bust down, yop Mexico
Damn damn damn, damn damn damn
I’m acting on a fucking renegade
My left wrist on lemonade
I’m juggin’ off the fucking iPhone
Google Voice for the back page
They doing stings at the Marriott
Bitch it’s time to relocate
My OG once told me
Ain’t no cake like hoe cake
Never been to college but I’m making profit
Think that nigga snitching, wire on his collar
Mobbin’ out at Nordstroms, smoking on this power
Whippin’ up the kick, then my nigga shower
Bitch you out of pocket, why you always wantin’?
Never keep it real, why you always lying?
Say your nigga shinin’, now you on my line
Keep it moving ho, money on my mind

[Chorus: OG Maco]
Boppin’ ass bitch
Naggin’ ho, little boppin’ ass bitch
Fuck ‘em, fuck ‘em, little boppin’ ass bitch
Naughty bitch, little boppin’ ass bitch

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Meet your bitch on a LA flight
Up in first class, I just got a check
Hundred thousand off the tour, I’ma need more
Yeah, put that on the set
Sippin’ lean out the baby bottle
With the latest model, I just superflex
She just do it when we get into it
Man I swear to god she need a Nike check
Fifty on me like I’m Sonny, woah
Never tell her when I’m coming, woah
I’m just getting to the money, woah
Fuck her, pass her, then she got to go
Hit up Larry, told him boy you doin’ good
48 hundred, that’s my neighborhood
Countin’ up the paper, making sure it’s good
40 on me, man I wish a nigga would
Juggin’ bitches off the landline
I’ma blow like a landmine
That’s your bitch acting like a fan
Had to tell her hold up, she on stand time
Groupie bitches in the condo
9 on me like I’m Rondo
Tommy off, need it pronto
It’s raining money, need a poncho

[Chorus: OG Maco]
Boppin’ ass bitch
Naggin’ ho, little boppin’ ass bitch
Fuck ‘em, fuck ‘em, little boppin’ ass bitch
Naughty bitch, little boppin’ ass bitch
