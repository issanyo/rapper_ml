[Intro]
I just copped the Benz and the new Porsche
I just want the Rollie with the white face
I just put my lawyer on retainer, nigga
'Cause I might just have to murk the plaintiff nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm getting money, think I'm Illuminati
All these bitches buying bodies
I'm going Kamikaze in the brand new Mazi (flex!)
Floor, I wanted diamonds, this shit look like hockey (f-f-flex!)
Tattoos all on my young'un face
He bought to leave the country, he like fuck a case
We bouta buy the bar, nigga fuck a case
Spraying champagne in her fucking face
She like,"Flock, you've got expensive taste" (Flocka)
It came from bringing bags down the Interstate (trap)
Niggas pocket watching, wondering what I make
I keep the pocket rocket, better guard your face

[Chorus]
I just copped the Benz and the new Porsche (skrrt!)
I just want the Rollie with the white face (flex!)
I just put my lawyer on retainer nigga
Cause I might just have to murk a plaintiff nigga (squad!)
I'm going independent, fuck the majors, nigga
Street money, fuck the majors, nigga
Still trappin', what you need? I get it catered, nigga
I got elbows by the bag, pick your flava, nigga

[Verse 2]
I been screaming "Fuck the rap shit" (fuck it)
Your favorite rapper got a fat bitch (hahaha)
I'm doing shows and selling bales at the same time (Flocka)
I'm taking business calls and trapping off the same line
Hot boy like I'm Benji (Benji)
Broad day you can meet me at the BP (BP)
Diamond wet like some Fiji
"Flock how you popping? You ain't dropping CDs"
I put Christians on wifey, she all walking bliss
I hear 'em yelling in the crowd "Flock a living legend" (Waka)
I get 30 racks while walking, I take that and stretch it (you know)
Nigga, I don't get mad, bitch I'm in my bag

[Chorus]
I just copped the Benz and the new Porsche (skrrt)
I just want the Rollie with the white face (flex!)
I just put my lawyer on retainer nigga
Cause i might just have to murk a plaintiff nigga
I'm going independent, fuck the majors nigga (majors, nigga)
Street money, fuck the majors nigga (majors, nigga)
Still trappin', what you need? I get it catered, nigga
I got elbows by the bag, pick your flava, nigga
