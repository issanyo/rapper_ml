[Intro]

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed
(Squaaaaad)

[Verse 1: RaceHood]

I got hella bitches on the couch
I put my dick in their motherfucking mouth
I keep my riches in my roshes
Mario kart, yoshi

Justin Waugaman (4x)

Now I'm fucking in the kitchen
Hoes stay in your niches
I'll drag you out like Ray Rice
I make a nigga think twice

[Verse 2: G-Hard]

Of mice and men
I got rice and yen
I fuck an asian bitch
She a ten
Or is she a 6
I'm Drake running through it
Or am I a dick
Think and chew it

Hey girl am I in yet
Don't feel it when my dick wet
Screaming Allahu Akbar
GTA, that's rockstar

[Bridge: Racehood]

I got hella bitches on the couch (3x)
I put my dick in your motherfucking mouth

[Verse 3: Racehood]

Am I albino
I don't know
Hard as a rhino
Ask your ho
Chill, keep it on the low
Lower than nick's flow oh
So that's how it goes ho
Apollo Ohno

[Bridge]

(Squaaaaad)

[Outro: Racehood]

I got hella bitches on the couch (3x)
I put my dick in your motherfucking mouth

Got em! Hahahahahaha
