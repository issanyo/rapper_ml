[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Gudda, get me that xanax
Hurricane Game, Lex Luger

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Weezy up in this bitch, y'all niggas can't breathe
Finna put a stamp on your bitch, bring in the stampede
Y'all just fuck niggas, only real niggas fuck with me
Here to paint the town red, hello it's the martian
Your now in tune wtth Tuncehi, it's Weezy F Carter
One shot from the Glock turn a bum nigga to a martyr
Blood gang bitch, all my niggas Spartans
They pissed off like bladders
Weezy F for Fireman, she all up on my ladder
Pop that pussy, mama come up to daddy
My guns talk, bitch I'm speechless
She sucking dick all night, y'all niggas a bunch of fuckin' leeches
Cash rules everything around me, y'all niggas cream and peaches
Tired of the bullshit, all I hear is screeches
My bitch say she miss me, that's a misdemeanor
These niggas fed up, pussy all I'm eatin'

[Hook: Game]
Came through in that Phatom, niggas swear I was Styles P
Y'all a bunch of fuck niggas, told y'all not to fuck with me
50 bands in my pocket, next stop K.O.D

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
Rich Gang up in here, all I rep Young Munna
Gudda Gudda, straight up out that gutta
Real niggas talking, I tell that bitch shut up
We ain't Hollywood, we Hollygrove
Catch me down in Cali, all my niggas got Calicos
High roller niggas, that' how we roll
