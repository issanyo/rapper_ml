[Intro: Sample (Dr. Dre & Ice Cube)]
Take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth to help your black ass?
You goddamn right!
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Mexicans, they don't want to see us make it
Blacks, they don't want to see us make it
Fuck the police, fuck the, fuck the police
Fuck the police, fuck the, fuck the police
Mexicans, they don't want to see us make it
Blacks, they don't want to see us make it
Fuck the police, fuck the, fuck the police
Fuck the police, fuck the, fuck the police

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Coke selling, kush smoking, pill popping nigga
Kickdoor, jackboy, I'ma rob a nigga
New model cars plus some big booty bitches
Three grams of purp, put it in one Swisher
Tell Big 'Twan that I fucked his girl and sister
The trap is a fairy tale, I'll rob your ass in the hood
Got a supercharged blower on my car hood
On 28's, sipping lean, life's great
Them niggas dissing us, call them fuck niggas fake
I'ma heavyweight, motherfuck a featherweight
Put a mic in my hand, I bet I'll fucking make it
Put a pistol in my hand, I bet I'll fucking make it, Waka
One dead, two dead, why not shoot three?
Four niggas resting, four niggas get beat to sleep
Five with me with a five-shot revolver
Waka Flocka Flame, you can call me the problem solver

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Mexicans, they don't want to see us make it
Blacks, they don't want to see us make it
Fuck the police, fuck the, fuck the police
Fuck the police, fuck the, fuck the police
Mexicans, they don't want to see us make it
Blacks, they don't want to see us make it
Fuck the police, fuck the, fuck the police
Fuck the police, fuck the, fuck the police

[Verse 2: Cartel MGM]
Cocaine-cooking, Glock-shooting Mexican
Bricks in the trunk, 85 South trafficking
UPS delivery, bales at my front door
Cartel got your son trapping by the liquor store
Where I come from, you say: "Fuck the police"
'Cause I'm from the streets, I'm a menace to society
Fuck it, I'll be one, so empty out the register
Put the money in the bag, he praying like a minister
"Please, please sir, don't take my life away"
I live this gangsta shit, I do it everyday
'Caine slinging, gang banging, hit licks, move bricks
Them boys pull up, Cartel busting shit
Only pussy niggas associate with pigs
Snitching like a bitch for the shit that I did
You talk about: "Cartel ran up in my spot
He took my damn chain and everything I got"

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Mexicans, they don't want to see us make it
Blacks, they don't want to see us make it
Fuck the police, fuck the, fuck the police
Fuck the police, fuck the, fuck the police
Mexicans, they don't want to see us make it
Blacks, they don't want to see us make it
Fuck the police, fuck the, fuck the police
Fuck the police, fuck the, fuck the police

[Outro: Tay Beatz (as corrupt cop), Cartel MGM & Waka Flocka Flame]
