[Intro]
A-Trak I like this shit man
Them hoes gone have to get insurance
AFLAC, AFLAC
It's ya boy Nino let's go

[Hook]
You tryna get a hustle?
Work that muscle
You tryna make double?
Work that muscle
You having money troubles?
Work that muscle
If you don't wanna struggle, better work that muscle
Work that, work that muscle
Work that, work that muscle
Work that, work that muscle
Work that, work that muscle

[Verse 1]
Standing ovation man my girl can make her booty clap
And she don't weigh too many pounds but shit her booty fat
That's too much for them younger boys, what they gone do with that
Even them older niggas say that want the cootie cat
Yeah I know you see her she a champion
And she half european, half african
And what I told her, why don't you let me come smash a ton
And out a big long dick into your ass and tongue
I'm a HP and I'm exactly what you're looking for
Embrace me, open up the cookie jar and baby taste me
Now make that ass work, you know how to do it
You a twerkin' expert

[Hook]

[Verse]
She a twerkin' expert, need I explain it
You see them two little freaks she got with her, they still in training
She told them hoes listen and see if they got tuition
Her booty poppin' outta the back of them True Religions
Work it like a nine to five, tryna get some over time
She ain't finished twerkin', it's a party she on over grind
She got a lot of ass [?] necessary, she got a nigga on fire and we in February
She killin them bitches she on her cemetery
Her boobs kickin', her ass like Adam Vinatieri
When we first meet I thought she was a stripper
I pulled my money out and tried to tip her

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You say you want this cash baby, well gone shake that ass baby
And pour this in your glass baby, and we gone have a blast baby
They bout to turn your gas and water off, well you gone have to drop your daughter off
And you better not catch a charlie horse
Cause you gone have to work [?]

[Hook]

[Outro]
Happy thought is right, when you serve bass at dinner time or anytime
You're sure to make a hit
Low Pros, it makes bass more satisfying than ever
See for yourself
