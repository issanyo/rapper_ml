[Hook x2]
I'm ballin' in the game, while you haters on the bench
I'm tryin' to get that Bill Gates money, ain't talkin' about a fence
I got plenty D but I don't mean defense
Nigga disrespect? Leave his body with a stitch

[Verse 1]
These haters try to knock me, but I ain't a door
Green and white, homie I keep that 9 on me Rondo
Old player with the heat, call me Alonzo
Take a nigga's dough don't give a fuck if it was John Doe
Got that dirty money spreading around like germs
Been blowing this money from a long turn
I'm burning these bitches head like a bad perm'
And I donate to their mouth a whole lot of sperm
Ballin' on these haters, where my toupet
And when I hit the club, I'm doing it Bombay
About to run the whole game but I'm no running back
Beat a nigga so bad got him running back

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Head in the sky, got the booth full of clouds
Shawty come do something to make a nigga proud
Pour the liquor in my cup, that place her in my rap
Get around the bitch head, you know it's a wrap
They swallowed my kids that's why I don't have any
If I could make 'em from the mouth I'd have plenty
Got that million dollar swag is why you haters mad
You niggas garbage, now where's the Glad bag?
I'm live on TV, you haters watchin' me
She ain't a babysitter but your bitch watchin' me
I'mma charge her so bad she gon call a file
Make her ass tap out, throw in the towel
