Jet Life
Yeah
We ain't gon' waste no time

[Verse 1]
The labels is lavendar
My lady's Ralph Lauren fashion
I'm been mashing back and forth to the lab
Trying to make it happen
Addicted to extravagance
A magnet to chips
Grabbing and dashing with all that shit
Not leaving fingerprints
Niggas is killing friends over brotherly arguments
We should all stay alive and just enjoy this shit
We work hard for it, my collection of cars is immense
Open the jar and release a heavenly scent

[Hook]
Cloud up and twist, plot a hit, messages sent
I bet them niggas never try to play us again
Uh, plotout a hit, messages sent
I bet them pussy niggas never try to play us again
Let 'em in

[Bridge]
Know what I'm saying, how big dogs say
Keep them out, let the motherfuckers in

[Verse 2]
Uh
Let the nines in, smoke out the den
Park the Benz, hopped out slid
Your niggas froze, some of them hid
Gamed on their shit, we hella dipped
I knocked your bitch, I ain't even a pimp
She on the strip, bringing it back 'round ten
That's what she said, that's what she meant
Said she'd kick in, that's what she did
A trill bitch, very real in this atmosphere at the table
When I feast bosses eating, I'll pull you up a chair
Everybody easting, everybody sharing
Organized rhyme family got the profits rising
Where we go from, that depends on whether you scared
Cause scared don't make bread, and we trying to beat the point spread
(?) on the water but I ain't in a waterbed
That's a ship I had to charter there
I got an apartment up in here
A boss is always prepared
Yup

[Outro]
Yeah
