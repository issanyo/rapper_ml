[Intro]
There's no right part of murder, not ever, and we're not in this to make a name for ourselves
Then what are you and Otacon fighting for?
The future, you can stop being part of a mistake, starting now

[Verse]
Tip of the top, got a mil and a rock
I told that lil bitch that I'm Mr. Monopoly
Sign on the dot, I say fuck a lil watch
I know time is the money, I know that you watchin' me
Feel like Aladdin, I ride on a carpet
I aim at a target, and genie up out of me
Hickory, dickery, lickery, swallow me
Got a white bitch who named Hillary all on me
Fly like a bird, and geeked like a nerd
If money was lotion, I'm rubbin' it all on me
Ain't paid the bill but the money been callin' me
I'ma get rich and I put that on poverty
Circle real tight like I'm doin' geometry
Bitch I'm a beast like I study biology
I'ma superior, Mister Miyagi me
All my interior look like mahogany
Cruisin' the street, I pull up to the curb
In my own lane and you better not merge
You like the son that I ain't really want
So I beat your little ass 'til you get off my nerves
Feel like a prophet, I'm speakin' the word
Up in the night like I'm out in The Purge
Remember them days my dick in the dirt
Get a check every month on the first and the third
I'm off the bean and I feel like Vegeta
My plug is an alien, thought he was Frieza
Hit 'em with iron, he came out the cleaner
I like that lil bitch but I don't really need her
This ain't a drill nigga, follow procedure
I'm takin' my mobile suit straight out the cleaner
You a little bent so you playin' with needles
Might take all your shit while you havin' a seizure
Do what I do nigga, that is a hassle
King of the hill nigga, where is my castle?
Prince of the city, I need a Rapunzel
Bang on my chest like I'm George of the Jungle
Fuck all that shit, I ain't tryna be humble
You had the ball, but you blew it and fumbled
You fallin' off and you might as well tumble
Plantin' my feet in this bitch, I won't stumble

[Chorus]
Metal Gear Solid, I kill 'em on camera
I'm at the opera, I'm in the Phantom
Used to be ugly, but now I'm real handsome
Grant you a wish if you rub on my lantern
Metal Gear Solid, I kill 'em on camera
I'm at the opera, I'm in the Phantom
Used to be ugly, but now I'm real handsome
Grant you a wish if you rub on my lantern
Metal Gear Solid, I kill 'em on camera
I'm at the opera, I'm in the Phantom
Used to be ugly, but now I'm real handsome
Grant you a wish if you rub on my lantern
Metal Gear Solid, I kill 'em on camera
I'm at the opera, I'm in the Phantom
Used to be ugly, but now I'm real handsome
Grant you a wish if you rub on my lantern
