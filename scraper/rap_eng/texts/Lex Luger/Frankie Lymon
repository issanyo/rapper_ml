[Hook: Que]
Why do fools fall in love? I know nothin' about it
Mama told me 'bout these bitches and said she don't allow it
I got five different wives and they all like to fuck
I used to think I was in love, now I see it's just lust
Sometimes I think I'm Frankie Lymon
Maybe that's why I act like Frankie Lymon
We make these bitches stalk us just like Frankie Lymon
But we could never get caught up like Frankie Lymon

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Mama always told me that these hoes scandalous and petty
She may be young but she ready, boy don't you eat that spaghetti
Treat that bitch out to American Deli
Never let a bitch Frank Lymon me
Catch a bitch layin' on her spine
Molly, dick in her vagina
And I'm married to five different bitches like type of religion
Ain't goin' out like Frankie Lymon
And it's 'gainst my religion to cut one of these bitches
So fuck on the homie behind me
And I pity the fool who's fallin' in love
I'd rather spend a hundred K on my diamonds
Drop the top on my California 'Rari
Could ride a chopper, that bitch like [?]

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Whippin' up the dope, I feel like John Gotti
Pull up to you, chow down on you, my lil' bro gon' watch you
Fuck nigga, I'll give it to you raw, and good luck, nigga
You a duck nigga, you'll get stuck, nigga
Just got pulled over, them niggas hatin' on me
In dem Foreigns Foreign Foreigns
Why you wanna see a nigga's card? Why you wanna see a nigga's bottle?
Ayyyyy, y'all fuck niggas really like to argue
Better think smarter like [?], left pocket new charger

[Outro]
Hey young America
We need to talk
You may think this is uncool
You may even think it is bogus
But I want to tell you about something that has everyone buzzing
Low Pros (screaming)
You may have heard of it
You may have seen someone smoking it
But do you know the full story?
Do you know the blunt truth?
You there! (laughing) Stop Laughing
Laughing is a symptom caused by (Bass)
Take a look at yourself, are you addicted?
Low Pros
