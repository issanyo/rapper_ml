[Hook]
Before I start my day, you know I gotta touch the sky first
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first
Before I make a play, you know I gotta touch the sky first
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first
Before I pull up on your baby mama, I gotta touch the sky first
'fore I step in Benihana's, I gotta touch the sky first
Right before I pin the corner, gotta touch the sky first
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first

[Verse 1]
KK got my mind blown, roll up with a blindfold
Police jump behind me, I'm like OJ in that bronco
I just get my grind on, High-Tech in my styrofoam
Famous bitches sendin' naked pictures to my iPhone
I prefer the papers, got the pilot high off vapors
I might smoke an acre of a couple different flavors
Ride my Mercede, piss-pissin' off the neighbors
I'm just gettin' money so I don't get why they hatin'
Before I deal with all this bullshit, I gotta get high
Chasin' money homie, I can't leave a dollar behind
If you chase that money too, then we got a lot in common
I be smokin' more Os while I'm  stackin' up my commas

[Hook]
Before I start my day, you know I gotta touch the sky first
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first
Before I make a play, you know I gotta touch the sky first
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first
Before I pull up on your baby mama, I gotta touch the sky first
'fore I step in Benihana's, I gotta touch the sky first
Right before I pin the corner, gotta touch the sky first
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first

[Verse 2]
I spend the weekend at Frollies, kickin' it, tippin' some strippers
I got a headace, she gave me head, now I feel a lot better
I drink it straight from the bottle, I shoot it right off the hip
Stuff a Moonrock in the ground, 'bout to roll up a rocketship
I gotta take that bitch on knockin' her off, now my dick gone
Take a few shots to the dome, she say that she love me, then she poppin', gone
Might get us something to eat, later though, we probably drop us a bean
Drivin' our foreign machine with the bitches thinkin' it's government cheese
Shinin' like a diamond, stun'n like Big Tymers
You know that Juicy stack more paper than a three ring binder
All day long I'm grind, only way we eat
And I don't get no sleep unless on that lean

[Hook]
Before I start my day, you know I gotta touch the sky first
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first
Before I make a play, you know I gotta touch the sky first
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first
Before I pull up on your baby mama, I gotta touch the sky first
'fore I step in Benihana's, I gotta touch the sky first
Right before I pin the corner, gotta touch the sky first
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first

[Bridge]
Moonrocks, Hi-Tech
Get the weed, where my X, bitch?

Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patron
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more
Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patron
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more
Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patron
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more
Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patron
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more
