(Intro Rick Ross)
You know they want to crucify you
They want to nail you to the cross nigga
We gon' rise on the seventh day and ball!

(Hook)
Back in the kitchen, smelling like burning rubber
It ain't a secret, all my money burning motherfucker
Thousand bitches, never love them
Obvious I'm a heart breaking motherfucker

(Chorus)
Back in the kitcen, smelling like burning rubber
It ain't a secret I'm a money burning motherfucker
Thousand bitches, never love them
Obvious I'm a heart breaking motherfucker
Getting money lil' dude
Big crib shit look like a middle school
Chrome rims, the white coupe
Walking on water, that what the white do (white do, white do)

(Verse 1)

I built a crib, pool on the roof
Lets pop a pill put the shoes on the coupe
I bought a tech, but got a chopper nigga
They running up, I'm making sure I stop a nigga
White girl, got it poppin' nigga
White girl, ( ? ) in the ( ? ) nigga
No love, it's about a profit nigga
Crackers go to drop a nigga when you flop a nigga
Back to the trap, back in the projects nigga
Got another one-eighty-seven in progress nigga
The Holy Ghost, thats my Ferarri nigga
Once you step on my toes, you can't say sorry nigga

(Chorus)
Back in the kitche, smelling like burining rubber
It ain't a secret I'm a money burning motherfucker
THousand bitches, never love them
Obvious I'm a heart breaking motherfucker
Getting money, lil' dude
Big crib, shit look like a middle school
Chrome rims, the white coupe
Walking on water, that what the white do (white do, white do)

(Verse 2)

Rozay! Forget about it
I'm a made man, forget about it
Twenty million! forget about it
Say your prayers, forget about it
You want to take it there?! forget about it
Get you knocked off, forget about it
Maybach motherfucker, we been about it

(Chorus)

Back in the kitchen, smelling like burning rubber
It ain't a secret I'm a money burning motherfucker
Thousand bitches, never love them
Obvious I'm a heart breaking motherfucker
Getting money, lil' dude
Big crib shit look like a middle school
Chrome rims, the white coupe
Walking on water, that what the white do (white do, white do
X5

Back in the kitchen smelling like burning rubber
It ain't a secret I'm a money burning motherfucker
Thousand bitches, never love em
Obvious I'm a heart breaking motherfucker
Getting money, lil' dude
Big crib shit look like a middle school
Chrome rims, the white coupe
Walking on water, that what the white do (white do, white do)
