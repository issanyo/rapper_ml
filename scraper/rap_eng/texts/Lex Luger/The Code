[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Cash in the bag twirlin' up hash
Blue in the count and I pour it out the mask
Weed on repeat up all night
Cash over sleep got hoes all type
Live and you burn, grind and you earn
Bitch I'm on fire, I sit and I burn
Stackin' up money flippin' it too
Y'all ain't heard me but theï»¿ Benjamin's do
I'm bouncin' through the club like Tigger
I'mma hit the dope, I'mma hit the liquor
Nigga get wrong I'mma hit a nigga
Take a nigga bitch home and I'mma hit her

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Reppin' TGOD
All these diamonds on me
Passin' every joint that I roll to the ones that grindin' with me
Now that's Taylor, (Taylor, Taylor)
Homie that's Taylor, (Taylor, Taylor)
Reppin' TGOD
All these diamonds on me
Passin' every joint that I roll to the ones that grindin' with me
Now that's Taylor, (Taylor, Taylor)
Lil' Homie that's Taylor, (Taylor, Taylor)

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
Bitch, I'm Taylored, ain't no ho cut from the same cloth
Realest, this money only thing fame brought
The crown ain't safe and I'm comin' for the spot
Snatchin' all wigs bitch I'm coming for the top
Put a run up on trip how I run up in the shots
Queen Roe, I don't see nothin' but the gwap

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
All my money I'mma get it soon as I get it I'mma spend it
Bought a new car soon as I whip this
Smokin' that marijuana in it
Takin' the value down but also taking a pound
And breakin' it smokin' it all to me ain't no savin' it
Fuck with them pods, no seeds or no shake in it

[Verse 4: Chevy Woods]
Uh, fuck these niggas they ain't really bout that
Look I know what these niggas these niggas all rap
What they know about nights that they never come back
But he two shot now shells all in the mac
On the top will never see none of that fall back
7-11 homie don't get ya head cracked
Taylor Gang fam you know I rep that
And we gettin' bake on anywhere the bread at

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Now that's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor
Homie that's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor
That's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor
Lil' Homie that's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor

[Interview: Wiz Khalifa]
Like for real, these niggas got it fucked up dog
I came straight from Pixburgh last year
And now I'm up there
You can't not put me up there with big niggas' names
They count me out of the lil' niggas' names
'cause I'm not with the lil' niggas
