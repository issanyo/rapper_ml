[Intro]
Rolling, we’re rolling!
Yeah!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Riding with the steel, puffing on the purp
Overtime on you niggas, 'cause I'm goin' to work
I'm going to work, I'm going to work
Overtime on you niggas, going to work
I’m gonna get it any means necessary
'Cause you know I'm bout my paper like a secretary
I'm going to work, I'm going to work, I'm going to work

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Gotta go to court tomorrow, DA on my dick
So I'mma wear my Audemar, just to make her sick
I might go yellow Presi on her, just to make her pissed
Then go home and break a brick and break it down to bacon bits
I'm going to work I'm going to work
The phone's popping, like we on the first
We up on Neiman's, we going berserk
A nigga cross me, he going to church
Ridin through the hood, back of the 'Bach
Started in the front, now they in back of the 'Bach
No love for the haters, no rap for the rats
Velcro shorty, we strapped and they strapped
Half you niggas telling so we never sell em work
They don't wanna come and get it so we mail em work
Put my money in it so you know it better work
And my shooters with me so you know they put in work

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Riding with the steel, puffing on the purp
Overtime on you niggas, 'cause I'm goin' to work
I'm going to work, I'm going to work
Overtime on you niggas, going to work
I’m gonna get it any means necessary
'Cause you know I'm bout my paper like a secretary
I'm going to work, I'm going to work, I'm going to work

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I might go buy a boat tomorrow, just to take a trip
Big belly rude boy, bad Jamaican bitch
I head straight to Colombia, I'm talking Bogota
Ship em up to Philly, Milly living like he Gorbachev
Not the Reagen Era but a nigga making cheddar
Rayful Edmond in the mirror and I'm never telling
The game sweet soda, seats watermelon
Clip full of sunflower seeds in my Mac-11
And I steal a mothafucka's like a student felon
Bookbags full of blocks and them bitches selling
I'm going to work, I'm going to work
I'm going to work, I'm going to work

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Riding with the steel, puffing on the purp
Overtime on you niggas, 'cause I'm goin' to work
I'm going to work, I'm going to work
Overtime on you niggas, going to work
I’m gonna get it any means necessary
'Cause you know I'm bout my paper like a secretary
I'm going to work, I'm going to work, I'm going to work

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Got some youngins that will murder for a new bike
Have you looking like you're fresh up out a food fight
Spaghetti on your head, shirt ketchup red
Shooting banana clips, we ain't never scared
Niggas say they looking for me, the ain't ever there
I'm like a Metro Phone Store 'cause I'm everywhere
I'm gone get it any means necessary
'Cause you know I'm bout my paper like a secretary
Gave my nigga fifty years, forever buried
He said he gone make it home like he neva worried
He said he’s gonna make it home like in Neveruary, damn!
Free my homie Rick, and free my homie Brick
Doing hard time, love the 36
Tried to get her number, shawty she ain’t on me
Wanna fuck me now, I’m like you dirty bitch!
Rookie of the year cause I murder shit, murder!
And I'm way back, 'cause it’s Maybach

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Riding with the steel, puffing on the purp
Overtime on you niggas, 'cause I'm goin' to work
I'm going to work, I'm going to work
Overtime on you niggas, going to work
I’m gonna get it any means necessary
'Cause you know I'm bout my paper like a secretary
I'm going to work, I'm going to work, I'm going to work
