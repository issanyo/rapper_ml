[Hook]
I got so many options, Flocka life popping
I'll bag your bitch today and take her best friend shopping
Take her mother shopping, take her brother shopping
Gucci got me super straight, ay shawty, I got that stupid cake
I got so many options, Flocka life popping
I'll bag your bitch today and take her best friend shopping
Take her mother shopping, take her brother shopping
Gucci got me super straight, ay shawty, I got that stupid cake

[Verse 1]
Signed to 1017, Warner Brothers Records
I can buy Burger King, McDonald's, or Checkers
Drugs like Eckerd's, cheap like Sketchers
Got more hoes than Hugh Hefner, hey shawty, I got options
In the club, bottle popping, marijuana loud
In the crowd, going wild, talking 'bout I think they like my style
Rock star shawty, I might jump off in the crowd
Bobblehead Waka, dreads going wild
Shawty super thick, but her friend stupid fine
Thinking to myself, like: "These hoes gotta be mine"
Trying to intwine, dick up in their spine
Flocka bossed up, fuck liquor, drinking wine

[Hook]
I got so many options, Flocka life popping
I'll bag your bitch today and take her best friend shopping
Take her mother shopping, take her brother shopping
Gucci got me super straight, ay shawty, I got that stupid cake
I got so many options, Flocka life popping
I'll bag your bitch today and take her best friend shopping
Take her mother shopping, take her brother shopping
Gucci got me super straight, ay shawty, I got that stupid cake

[Verse 2]
Why buy a car? Big bro got thirty whips
Sidekick bank account and all my money flip
Something on my hip, just so I don't slip
This is how I ball, but I ain't Lil' Flip
Mizay Management, shawty, fuck marriagement
So Icey Brick Squad, beef with us? Embarrassment
I'm fresher than a peppermint, I'm so high, I'm on elephants
I'm focused, you can't tell me shit, so lame ass niggas, I'm celibate
Flocka probably gonna tell a friend, not five for a fellow man
I got them and they go and quit, Hit Squad boys, let's do this shit
Drug dealer music, I influence
Oh let's do it, oh let's do it
