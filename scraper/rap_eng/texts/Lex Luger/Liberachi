Diamonds, all on my body
I'm a livin', livin' Liberace
Organized crime, don't fear nobody
I'm a livin', livin' John Gotti
Diamonds, all on my body

Organized crime, don't fear nobody
I'm a livin', livin' John Gotti

[Verse 1: M Watts]
My niggas, we do this, South Beach, my new shit
Found my new new bitch, mollied up, she clueless
Money blowin', it's too cold, finish line, we too close
Four doors on that 650, yeah nigga that's coupe though
Been been been been ballin', diamond on me, flossin'
Livin' Liberace, hoes think that I'm awesome
Base mailed and them K shells'll give a nigga 20
That phone jump for that whole thing, told 'em give me 20
I'll be right back, yeah, count that money
Call Papi's cell, we need another one
Patty cake that cake down, [?] pull them drapes down
Locked and we loaded, quarter mil' for this breakdown

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
White diamonds on a white cross, white hood, I'm in a white horse
Playing bitch be of the Ku Klux, I tax a nigga like a write-off
Steady gettin' that white off, all my niggas put 'em right on
Wanted poster for the heavy D, not because a nigga write songs
Overweight, tip the scale, quarter ki, [?]
Beat the case so I skipped the jail
If I toss a nickel then I wish you well
Rah, my hitmen don't miss men, they kill shit
Trunk a nigga then burn the car, know I'm talkin' that real shit
Body bags, duffle bags, couple gloves, couple shovels and
Dig the ditch for your mans and them
Ain't cost me no more than a couple grand
WOO! Just watch, niggas
King Push, we them watch niggas
Dope boys 'til death do us
Fuck with none of y'all cop niggas

[Verse 3: M Watts]
Middle of the kitchen, couple birdies go missin'
That wrist wop, them grits locked, it's homemade, it go instant
Listen up, it's Dunville, bottles up, done deal
Fake shit that they hittin' on, find out if these guns real
Live action, 2K,  bed somethin', I forget her
Four racks on that biker jacket, Balmain, fore weather
Rain sport, ball weather, carry on, that's all weather
All flyin', we all buyin', we all gettin' this damn cheddar
Margiela, Watts, nigga, all eyes, Pac, nigga
Money made, money blown, get back to that pot, nigga
Penthouse, 2 floors, you drop? Who knows?
Rap shit just don't work out, XOV that loophole
