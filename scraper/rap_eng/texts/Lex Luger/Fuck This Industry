[Intro]
Real nigga music
Ain't real, then move it
Hey, man, the industry's so motherfucking dirty, man
I watched this shit break down my motherfucking organization, man
Watch these niggas infiltrate this shit, man
Watch out for these labels, man
These folks fingerfucking y'all niggas, man
Real talk, man
Make sure your lawyer know what he's doing, man
He sign contracts right
'Cause homes might sign you on a fucked up deal, thinking that shit real
Don't get a 360, that shit ain't 100, my nigga
Waka Flocka Flame

[Chorus]
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Lord, take my back, the devil entered me
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Lord, take my back, the devil entered me

[Verse 1]
Lord, take my back, the devil entered me
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
They say tears is pain, I call it bullshit
'Cause when I'm finished crying, I'm back to this bullshit
I got a full clip from my enemies
They want to see me dead off these fucking streets
I drink this fucking liquor, you know, a remedy
Waka Flocka Flame, ain't no ending me
Shout out to my momma, man, she got my back
Man, I love my family, that's a fucking fact
Fuck this industry, I mean that shit, dog
Waka Flocka Flame, man, I want it all
I can't trust myself, so don't trust me
I can't trust my friends, man, they set me up
Back to this bullshit
Man, this industry full of bullshit

[Chorus]
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Lord, take my back, the devil entered me
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Lord, take my back, the devil entered me

[Verse 2]
Damn, I miss my brother, they wanna see me under
Disrespect my mother, then you gon' meet my brother
Damn KK, that shit fucked up
25 to life, he did it to defend his life
Shout out to my grandma for all them ass whoopings
That shit made me tough, no more ass whoopings
Shout out to my three uncles, they showed me how to ball
For dad, all my life, I gotta have it all
Shout out to my aunties for that female love
They showed me how to cook and clean and show a woman love
Shout out to my nieces, cousins, and my nephews
Man, I love my family, the Lord gon' one day bless you
Momma, don't cry, we gon' get it
And when we do it again, we gon' show them that we got it
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
They don't want shit but my money

[Chorus]-
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Lord, take my back, the devil entered me
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Fuck this industry, bitch, I'm in these streets
Lord, take my back, the devil entered me
