[Hook x2]
If you niggas got problems
Say it to my face, to my face
Say it to my face
If you niggas got problems
Say it to my face
If its beef up in the streets then
I ain' scared to catch a case

[Verse 1]
Go get your gorillas
I'm bringin' the zoo
You can bring yo choppas
We bringin bazooks
I mob wit real niggas I know that's gon' shoot
I ain't worried bout you pussies
You just ain't the truth
You niggas need to kill yo'self
Actin like you hard
If they get caught
They won't take they charges
They say they got these houses
But live in apartments
You ain't got no money bitch
You just wanna bargain

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Fuck yo beef I go ham
I pull back then I..(gun shot)
Cuz' my guys thats gon' dump yo body in a river man
I ain't playin' wit you hoes
Keep that AK in my Rolls
Ain't a nigga I can't name
Wit some powder and it go
They be ready to go to war
Leave some bodies on the floor
Yea we still tear up clubs but we crash 'em even more
(tear da club up nigga, tear da club up)
(tear da club up nigga, tear da club up)

[Hook]
