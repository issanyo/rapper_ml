[Intro]
Uh B.E

[Verse 1: B.E.]
I feel like Clark Kent
Maybe Bruce Wayne
I think I'm blowin' up
I think I'm Hussein
I don't want the riches
I'm say no to Regis bad
I think I'm more to life
I think I'm Jesus dad
I think I'm all these things
And I know you ain't
I'm thinkin' "Yes I Can"
You thinkin' "No I Can't"
I'm sayin' I'm the best
You reactin' "What the fuck!"
But just by watchin' me
I simply shut you up
And prove you wrong
That's what I usually do
Yo shit is ugly huh?
My shit is BEAUTIFUL!
Like a masterpiece
I think I'm Pablo Picasso
Punchlines I got em' in bulk
This rap game be callin' me Costco
I be droppin' lines
I bet you soon to copy
No point in droppin' mines
Man no kaboom can stop me
I think I'm Holy Lord
In a human's body
Cause low key I run shit
Like illuminati
Now I bet after that
They sayin' he's a mason
No you ain't hear em right
They saying he's amazin'
I got that white skin
Rap's other color
B.M.F for life man
Bad mother fucker
So you can blow money
While I blow minds
Man you don't show nothing
For me it's showtime
Run up on y'all like Deon
With my diamond S tee on
God damn look what B.E. on
Just stay cool and be calm
I'm full tank pedal to the metal
Y'all got the E on
Same deal when they playin' my records
You stuck in rewind
See me I move it forward
Focus on the drive Ford
Oh Lord! They won't survive
The moment I pull my sword uh
On some samurai or ninja shit
I got six feet deep like when I'm in ya bitch
Got em' pissed need tee pee
Yo they mad cause ya brother
Is a B.M.F... yo I'm a bad mother fucker uh
I feel like Clark Kent
Maybe Bruce Wayne
I think I'm blowin' up
I think I'm Hussein
I don't want the riches
I'm say no to Regis bad
I think I'm more to life
I think I'm Jesus dad
