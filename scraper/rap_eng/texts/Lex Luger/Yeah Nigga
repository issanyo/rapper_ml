[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & Cartel MGM]
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga, they call me Flocka, nigga
I got dreads, nigga, you want beef, nigga?
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga, I'm Cartel, nigga
My head is bald, nigga, you want beef, nigga?
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga, my flag is red, nigga
I'm a Blood, nigga you want beef, nigga?
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga, my flag is black, nigga
MGM goons straight murking niggas

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Flocka the gunman, red raindrops
And I'ma keep squeezing, everybody's body drop
Slick and Blood's album drop, I bet them niggas' album flop
Word around town, I got that beatbox
Flocka got the streets locked from L.A. to A-Town
From A-Town to D-Town, from D-Town to Chi-Town
From Chi-Town to M-Town, from M-Town to H-Town
From H-Town to New York, from New York to New Jersey
From New Jersey to CT, from J Nicks to ET
From ET to Greg Street, Waka Flame so street
True jeans cost a nigga $350, kush cost me $550
S550 and I'm trying to sell like 50

[Verse 2: Cartel MGM]
Tec 9, .45's, just another homicide
Finger on the trigger and I'm riding through the southside
Yeah, just looking for a pussy
Scrappy got the shotty and Psycho got the Uzi
Before they grab shit, I was busting down bricks
Wait, nigga, I'm still busting down bricks
Still in the hood, selling dope with the full clip
Still in the Honda, taking out-of-town trips
MGM banging, scale keep weighing
My Glock keep dumping, what the fuck you thinking
Back door trapping, Cartel booming
Black Glock, gray tape, Cartel robbing

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & Cartel MGM]
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga, they call me Flocka, nigga
