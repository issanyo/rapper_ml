(Intro)
Oh shit man, forreal before the cops come
Come on man, get this nigga out the trunk doe
We got shows on and shit man, c'mon Black! C'mon man!
Hey hey let's go man
We were supposed to have the car ready
Stick to the plan, we'll get out this bitch
I ain't goin to jail!
I ain't going back in no jailhouse!

(Hook)
Fuckin' with the squad, that's gone get yo' ass murked
I ain't lyin, how yo' ass layin' in the dirt?
If he ain't talkin' money I don't give a fuck
That type of nigga, how yo' ass layin' in the hearse? x2

(Verse 1)
Bang, bang, B-A-N-G
Runnin' on the green, I don't need cleats
All I need is money, and that's all I see
Aviator Guccis, all I see is G
Twenty once in that pack G, don't push to my eyes B (?)
Ass living (?), you past living
You lames come handle me
Getting money affecting me
Run yo mouth and we work the C (?)
If you bump that ass in Jackson, then you know we kept the C (?)
Don't fuck around with that Rob B
Don't make me have to ride on him
I'm a smooth nigga, I'm down to ride
Don't make me have to slide on him
All black and I'm masked up
And I ride with that Macs up
I hit a nigga now stacked to his chest (?)
Feel him up like Ciroc shots
I'm still G and I'll never change
I'm always known to stack dollars
That one down, he goin' down (?)
He sells flowers with that pollen (?)
On the block, Black put him in a hearse
Let me know if we got a problem
Don't fuck around, I'll leave yo' momma cryin'
And you'll end up with them cops callin'

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
Put a price on yo' head like a fitted cap
Crazy young nigga with the semi packed
I'm making money, I'm puttin' money, no counterfeit (?)
If you making money I'll take this money, no bullshit
Call my brother super he hit that back shot (?)
Or head shots, he'll take it all (?)
Man yo' brain's everywhere, no cleaning up
Man'll pay you caps, no I ain't no janitor (?)

(Verse 3: Urboyblack)
Sippin' on Corona
Chillin' with my niggas
Down to count them figures
Down to pull them triggers
Free my brother Duke
R.I.P. my niggas
(?)
Ha ha, ridin' round and we winnin'
Got yo' bitch here grinnin'
Made or not, she's singing
All my niggas is winnin'
Count the caps, we spendin'
This urboyblack
And damn right I'm winnin'!

(Hook)

(Outro)
Good shit fellas, good shit fellas
Yeah yeah yeah, we did the motherfuckin' job nigga
We some real Gs
Yeah that shit, that shit was 'aight man
Get shit done man, as always, man
You almost fucked it up, man
Black dropped the dead body and shit
Man you got scared when you seen them car lights too nigga!
Damn right nigga, I ain't goin' back
Fuck it nigga, let's go get something to eat
