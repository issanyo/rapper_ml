Intro:

Shout out to all my real niggas who run wild
Ain't nothing changed
But the rarri, the lambo, the bentley, the maybach, the phantom, the aston, the Spyker!!
Seven trey, seven duece, the seven one, the seven fours

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]

I go hard in the mothafuckin paint nigga
Touch eight figures stuff in the bank nigga uh
Order Twenty bottles of the Rozay (ROOOZZAAAYYYY)
Fuck first week bitch I ordered more weight (whoooo)
To these niggas I'm a mothafuckin problem
Hang with the bloods all the crips all the robbers
See Gucci that's my mothafuckin nigga
Twenty racks on it, bitch you fuckin with a killer (whooooo)
I can't hang with no pussy ass nigga
Thousand carats in the chain, quarter milli for it nigga
You think I give a fuck what other niggas think
Make another million everytime a nigga blink (whoooo)
I'm rolling up the purple and I'm sippen pink
Champagne drown a bitch till she gotta pee
She only get to ride unless she keep it wet
You looking at a gangsta in disguise you just ain't seen it yet
Call up bee's and beevis cuz she butt heads
She know I'm busy I don't need nothing but head
And I'm paying top dollars
Chain so big can't pop my collar
Pop one pill make a nigga spend a grand
Pop two pills make a nigga wanna dance
Pop my trunk, pop me a nigga
Just last night I had a dream I shot me a nigga
Pop my trunk ima pop me a ______
Just last night I had a dream I shot me a nigga
