[Chorus]
Yeah, hoe!
Kitana, Kitana, Kitana, Kitana
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
Kitana, Kitana, Kitana, Kitana
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
I step in this bitch and I do what I want
I don't give a damn and I don't give a fuck (yeah, hoe!)
I step in this bitch and I do what I want
I don't give a damn and I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
Princess Nokia, you can call me on my cellular
I think I'm the shit and I never been a regular
Rhymes I spit are sick, see you bleedin' from your jugular
You can suck my dick, all them shady fucks that set me up
Up in the crib, I'm up in the show
I'm doin' my thing like never before
I'm rockin' and droppin' and hittin' the floor
I give you the goodies, the goodies, let go
Pop, lock, and drop it, pop, lock, and drop it
Play them games like Atari, Mortal Kombat like Kitana
He be hopin' that I call him, he just wanna call me mama
Call ya back mañana, I ain't with it with ya drama
You are not my problem, I ain't with it with ya drama

[Skit: Princess Nokia]
I done told yo ass don't call me no more because I'm in a session right now

[Chorus]
Kitana, Kitana, Kitana, Kitana
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
Kitana, Kitana, Kitana, Kitana
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
I step in this bitch and I do what I want
I don't give a damn and I don't give a fuck
I step in this bitch and I do what I want
I don't give a damn and I don't give a fuck

[Verse 3]
Ain't got no hair on my tongue, got no reason to run
Yeah, my words are the reasons that I'll never use guns
I just wanna have fun and to live without fear
I put the ground to the ear and claimed that this was my year
I keep my speech on fleek while these bitches fake deep
You don't practice, you preach, I get applause when I speak
It's a difference for me, people comin' for me
I gotta show them that heat so they regret how they be
They take advantage of me, and I'ma put them to sleep
You never shit where you eat when you was eatin' for free
I really say what I do and ain't got nothing to prove
Prefer the sweetheart chick to my bitch attitude
People did me they dirt when I sat and did work
They just tryna take my picture, they don't care 'bout my worth
But I'm still gon' pray, enemies every day
'Cause it's really up to God come judgement day

[Chorus]
Kitana, Kitana, Kitana, Kitana
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
Kitana, Kitana, Kitana, Kitana
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!
I step in this bitch and I do what I want
I don't give a damn and I don't give a fuck
I step in this bitch and I do what I want
I don't give a damn and I don't give a fuck (yeah, hoe!)
