If I'm doing bad, I know what to do, what
Pull that trigger back and take my loot, that's right
Don't trust me ya'll, cause Pats a clown
You can come up missin', for the bricks and pounds, that's right
My stomach been touchin' my back, I'm out here bustin' my back
Tryna make these few ends meet, Ya'll niggas don't hear me yo
I don't care about goin' no jail, I gotta eat out here
I gotta a lotta folks, I gotta feed out here
Black Sheep of my fam, that's why I go ham
Don't care what you say about me, A hood nigga I am
I swear for livin' God, nigga better come off that cheese
K barrel gonna go to your legs, and blowin' off yo knees

[Verse 2:]
I see you nigga, just got work in
Just ran off with that dope, and kicked yo door in
Masked up with chopper, my dawg 2 4 glockas
Some nigga ran out with a gun, chopper went blocka blocka
Done took your goon out, he floppin' like a fish
Off in his own blood, you know a gangsta's wish
To flip the pounds and bricks, but it's a drought out here
Drug dealers turn to jackin', when it ain't no dope round here
You know we're quick to bust, leave a young niggas face in the dust
One way fa sho to get loot, elbows and grams we trust
So don't you get it twisted up, like a blunt or somethin'
I got the barrel in ya face you better give me somethin'
