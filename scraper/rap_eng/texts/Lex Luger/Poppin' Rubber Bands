[Intro: Yo Gotti (Sampled)]
Pop a rubberband, that's like a hundred grand
All fives, tens, and twenties, you wouldn't understand
Pop a rubberband, that's like a hundred grand
All fives, tens, and twenties, you wouldn't understand
Pop a rubberband, that's like a hundred grand
All fives, tens, and twenties, you wouldn't understand
Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Pop a, pop a, pop a, pop a

[Chorus: Yo Gotti (Sampled)]
Pop a rubberband, that's like a hundred grand
All fives, tens, and twenties, you wouldn't understand
Pop a rubberband, that's like a hundred grand
All fives, tens, and twenties, you wouldn't understand
Pop a rubberband, that's like a hundred grand
All fives, tens, and twenties, you wouldn't understand
Pop a rubberband, that's like a hundred grand
All fives, tens, and twenties, you wouldn't understand

[Verse 1: Jurrarri]
I pop rubberbands, the kids blowed a hundred bands
Magic City Monday night, I did it for the fans
Yellow Breitling, that's 160 bands
Twenty diamond chains, that's another hundred grand
2010 new Camaro, I paid fifty grand
Offset [?], another thirty grand
Pissy jewelry gang, dropped twenty on my hand
A sack full of Gucci belts, I'm the fucking man
Been had money, been had hundreds, still the fucking man
MTV and Comedy Central gave me eighty grand
You say you got a record deal, 150 grand
I got 80 just to show my fucking face, man
They flew me out to Hollywood, they want to meet the man
CEO of Ju Records, I cut the check, man
'Rarri, 'Rarri, 'Rarri, 'Rarri
'Rarri, 'Rarri, I'm still the fucking man

[Chorus: Yo Gotti (Sampled)]
Pop a rubberband, that's like a hundred grand
All fives, tens, and twenties, you wouldn't understand
Pop a rubberband, that's like a hundred grand
All fives, tens, and twenties, you wouldn't understand
Pop a rubberband, that's like a hundred grand
All fives, tens, and twenties, you wouldn't understand
Pop a rubberband, that's like a hundred grand
All fives, tens, and twenties, you wouldn't understand

[Verse 2: K. Vixen]
It's K. Vixen in this bitch, who did you expect?
[?] to these niggas, to these hoes, I'm a threat
And I'm gon' body slam the doors and cashing checks
That means I be getting money, hoes get upset
I got your nigga trained, he bring me what he earned
He got me eating shrimp while he got you eating sperm
See, I'm the realest in it, when will they ever learn?
You hoes done had your time to shine, so bitch, it's my turn
I know they wanna and I know wish they could, could
Ay, fuck Ashanti 'cause K. Vixen got that good good
I'm making moves, doing that these hoes should, should
A sexy ass chick, but I'm still hood, hood
South side, hoe, yeah, that's what I'm repping
I bought the Prada bag just so I can tote the weapon
You need to start stepping or call the paramedics
'Cause I'ma give these hoes shots like a diabetic

[Chorus: Yo Gotti (Sampled)]
Pop a rubberband, that's like a hundred grand
All fives, tens, and twenties, you wouldn't understand
Pop a rubberband, that's like a hundred grand
All fives, tens, and twenties, you wouldn't understand
Pop a rubberband, that's like a hundred grand
All fives, tens, and twenties, you wouldn't understand
Pop a rubberband, that's like a hundred grand
All fives, tens, and twenties, you wouldn't understand
