[Chorus: Jurrarri]
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here

[Verse 1: Jurrarri]
Red light, yellow light, green light, damn, 'Rarri out of here
I-65, I'm out of here
Yellow diamonds got me fly as a fucking leer
Yellow VVS's in my fucking ears
The neighbor told my peers that I need to fucking chill
Well, cut that heater on, I'm known to hold this heater, homes
I [?] blaze your ass, never play [?] heat, homes
But I'm known to keep it G 'cause I'm street strong
2010, new Camaro, yeah, I'm riding strong
Offsets, yellow guts, and my motor grown
And my Glock chroms 'cause my fucking paper long
Better throw up a grand if you think you grind on
Stack your paper up, I'm in another zone
I'm on another time, got another phone
Got another bitch, bad redbone
She give me super head, she got my head gone

[Chorus: Jurrarri]
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here

[Verse 2: Nino]
I'm racing fast, boy, my whip run like a NASCAR
Pussy's good on gas, so you can't catch me in that Jaguar
Burning rubber betting, always subject to getting cash, boy
Watching out for police, they be on a nigga's ass, boy
'Cause my shit go so fast, boy, soldiers watch me when I go
Ricky Bobby on the highway, running lights and passing stores
Switch my gear from high to low, plus my paint, it match my clothes
Step out in the [?] my door, you think I'm in a fashion show
But no need for matching, though, 'cause I'm flyer than the wind
Fast as a Ferrari go, that Charger you can't catch me in
You know what I'm flexing in, if I wanna flex again
I'll pull up right next to him, my motor built by Mexicans
On a beat by Lex again, so you know I gotta smash
Nino known to wreck the track just like a train and car just crashed
So when you see pulling over, don't think I ran out of gas
I just had to slow it down, I'm racing, I was going fast

[Chorus: Jurrarri]
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here
I'm racing, watch me go, I'm racing, watch me go
I'm racing, watch me go, yeeeeeern, bitch, I'm out of here
