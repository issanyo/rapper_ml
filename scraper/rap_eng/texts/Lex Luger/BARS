[Hook: Sez Batters]
Same old shit just a different day
Out here tryin to get it each and every way
Tell a fire fighter a dragons in the booth
Put me in a cypher guess what ima do
Give'em give'em give'em bars
Give'em give'em give'em bars
Give'em give'em give'em bars
Better open up a tab cuz im goin hard

[Verse 1: Sez Batters]
Nigga welcome up to my session I'm show you just how I bless it
In this booth rappers turn to pray this is just my confession
When it comes to the money I dont know the word recession
So I blew though the cheese ladies love the way I be dressin
I work my fingers to the bone I am never lazy
Superman fly on another planet daily
I swear im on my job I promise I ain't callin in
I got the game buzzin somebody bring the pollen in
No matter what the team im like chanucey I get my bills up
Gotta rep just from the bars, work it out, on my flow like sit ups
I bear arms Labatte blue, Im about ink check my tattoos
Tryin to get between a couple mil...Snack food
Baraka couldn't stop him, my flow is nuts like bar food
Chillin in Barcelona enjoy the view from my barstool
You ask a bartender in Barstow they know my bars well
Im a barbarian on them barbells
