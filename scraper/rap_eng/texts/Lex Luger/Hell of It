[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame (Sampled)]
28's so fucking high, I'm sitting on them elephants

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame (Sampled)]
Green diamonds, spending shit, I bought it for the hell of it
Bought, bought, bought it for the hell of it, bought it for the hell of it
Green diamonds, spending shit, I bought it for the hell of it
28's so fucking high, I'm sitting on them elephants
Green diamonds, spending shit, I bought it for the hell of it
Bought, bought, bought it for the hell of it, bought it for the hell of it
Green diamonds, spending shit, I bought it for the hell of it
28's so fucking high, I'm sitting on them elephants

[Verse: Jurrarri]
I bought the black chain, Flocka bought that green chain
I rep D4L, he rep So Icey, mane
We smoking hella dro, we getting hella throwed
Now we doing shows with Gucci Mane and Shawty Lo
Yeah, Shawty Lo, that's my fucking CEO
We 'bout to bring it back, to the front door
Been had money, that's what I stunt for
This that pimp shit, so get in line, hoe
Ju and Waka Flocka, been iced, hoe
We both tatted up, just like them white folks
Cut the lights off, now watch that ice glow
We into the black diamonds, like a light show
Ju, Ju, Ju, Ju
Ju, Ju, Ju, Ju
Ju, Ju, Ju, Ju
Ju and Waka Flocka (Ju and Waka Flocka, bitch)

Green diamonds, spending shit, I bought it for the hell of it
Bought, bought, bought it for the hell of it, bought it for the hell of it
Green diamonds, spending shit, I bought it for the hell of it
28's so fucking high, I'm sitting on them elephants
Green diamonds, spending shit, I bought it for the hell of it
Bought, bought, bought it for the hell of it, bought it for the hell of it
Green diamonds, spending shit, I bought it for the hell of it
28's so fucking high, I'm sitting on them elephants
