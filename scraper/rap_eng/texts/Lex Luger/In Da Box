[Intro: Sean Garrett]
Can you compare money, not not really though
Yeah you want my shawty, can’t can’t get her though
Brag brag brag about how big your house is…patio
Ask your girl what we did? We just smashed on the radio

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
She like to call me baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby when I got her in the box
She like to wrap her legs, her legs, her legs, her legs, her legs around on my neck and keep them locked
She, she, she like to call me baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby when I got her in the box
She like to wrap her legs, her legs, her legs, her legs, her legs around on my neck and keep them locked
We just smashed on the radio

[Verse 1: Sean Garrett]
Just got to miami, touch down from them grammys
First stop king of diamonds, hope them bitches ready
Yup I pull up in that no top, gave them all a headache
Told the girl I need them racks on racks and damn it I need that in a hurry
Shawty flirting while she workin trying us to get them behind them curtains
She said the word is that I make that paper fly like michael jordan
I say well you know?
Free throw, mota, zero, gotta make sure all the girls eat though
But she mad, but she mad, that she know, I got, I got, a girl, a girl at home
She don’t, she don't, she don't care, all she said is get up here
She got you nigga, that ain’t fair
I want you to be mine, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I’m accustomed to custom
Cussin' at customs, treat my whip like my sneakers
Once I scuff em it’s nothing
I get money in bundles hustle for scoops in the summer
I’m I'm I'm making her wet, so she’s making a puddle
She resembles a model, sexy and slender as Tyra
I just set you on fire, sweating your name and your number
She got a mean walk, I let my c.r.e.a.m. talk
Pent house sweet, jack and the beanstalk
Swear she’s a dime piece, nothing but vickys on
Two pinky rings, tricking like I’m Nicky Barnes
Might blow a hundred racks fuck a 200 thou'
Put you on your feet, the Bentley just to roll around
Members only, I’m talking baller status
LeBron numbers cribs in Atlanta to Dallas
Back to the 305 kisses staring in my eyes
It’s time to tat my name inside your inner thigh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sean Garrett]
She call me her baby, I like to call her squirter
She do things them things that virgins ain't never heard of
She no scream my name unless I hurt her
Get from my RV nigga
But in the box she call me murder
I like to call her Jackie O, presidential on hold
Anything that I gotta get done, she get down and do it for me
Ain’t gotta never worry about shootin' off cause she gonna shoot it for me
She take that pistol from it cock it like she own it

[Hook]
