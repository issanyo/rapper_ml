[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
This a no fly zone, no
Dunk and Waka Flock putting on
It's on, nigga
Flocka
Dunk, these niggas pussy, boy, I swear to God
He ain't never killed, seen a man take his last breath
Seen a man take his last step
We do this shit for real, my nigga, we don't need no ref, Flocka
Balling with a referee
I'm from the G Street, my niggas selling beats and selling weed
Having dreams of snakes, God, what you telling me?
Brick Squad Monopoly, a clique full of felonies

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame & YG Hootie]
They ask us what we doing, we just koolin' it
We just koolin' it, we just koolin' it
They ask us what we doing, we just koolin' it (Monopoly)
We just koolin' it, we just koolin' it (yeah, BSM)

[Verse 1: YG Hootie]
This YG fucked them hoes, I can't trick no dough
All these stacks on stacking, that's what she's on me for
Riding down the block, beat up, swerving through
I can trust no hoes, BSM my crew
Money, cars, clothes, pay some loyalty
No, the beef is nothing but some lawyer fees
Mark that pour me up, can't no one show me up
I shut your section down, that K gon' hold me up
Swear to God, I seen that chopper go fly, fly, fly
YG walk a mission, nigga, fuck a driveby
They carry your ass up and they ain't ringing, hoodstar
I'm with the Twin Towers and they cutting my cigar

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame & Slim Dunkin]
They ask us what we doing, we just koolin' it
We just koolin' it, we just koolin' it
They ask us what we doing, we just koolin' it
We just koolin' it, we just koolin' it (Dunk, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2: Slim Dunkin]
Brick Squad in the club, hoes start choosing
Finna watch my team ball like Mark Cuban
HID on them cars and they dark cruising
Fifty whips valeting, no carpooling
My chain, spent a buck for this
My watch, got the buck for this
Ain't no tucking this (why?)
I ain't no fucking bitch
My name ring bells all around town
Beat a nigga's head like surround sound

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
They ask us what we doing, we just koolin' it
We just koolin' it, we just koolin' it
They ask us what we doing, we just koolin' it
We just koolin' it, we just koolin' it (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Eating shrimp pasta, Italian koolin' it
In between your eyebrows, I'ma Ruger it
Every beat, Lex Luger it
Drug selling music, I influence it
"Waka Flocka Flame, explain your style", I rap with pain
Brick Squad Monopoly, twenty niggas, twenty chains
Go hard like Rose, keep a nine like Luol Deng
I'm the number one draft pick like Cam Newton, man

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame & Kebo Gotti]
They ask us what we doing, we just koolin' it
We just koolin' it, we just koolin' it
They ask us what we doing, we just koolin' it (we just koolin' it)
We just koolin' it, we just koolin' it (yeah, ayy)

[Verse 4: Kebo Gotti]
Ayy, they ask me what I'm doing, I said I'm koolin' it
What the fuck you thought?
If I'm cruising in it, I paid for it
What the fuck you bought?
All these jewels around my neck look like a ice box
Say my heart cold like a ice box
And I'm on top
Swear to God, nigga, I won't stop
Think I'm playing? Try me, bitch
I'm guaranteed the gun gon' pop
Fuck with Brick Squad, Hit Squad, you gon' die
I get money 365, that's no lie, I'm koolin'

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
They ask us what we doing, we just koolin' it
We just koolin' it, we just koolin' it
They ask us what we doing, we just koolin' it
We just koolin' it, we just koolin' it
They ask us what we doing, we just koolin' it
We just koolin' it, we just koolin' it
They ask us what we doing, we just koolin' it
We just koolin' it, we just koolin' it
