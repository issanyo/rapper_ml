[Verse 1: Locsta]
All I talk is money, my Adam's apple came from the bank
All I got is hundreds, it look fake, this not a prank
I'm armed & dangerous, I'm always anxious, I'm on my G's and D's
I'm southbound on 35, come back with key's & p's
Nigga please I got it sowed up like stitches on a shirt
I sell weed, I sell work, but I drank all my purp
NBA player like Dirk, Never Broke Again since birth
Yung Gizzle got that work, Criminal Crook Gang my turf
I drank a lotta syrup mane free my bro Big Menace
He be gettin' on my nerve, always wantin' me to get minutes
I'ma put money on his books, I'm wit Spank Loc & the crooks
I'ma get her if she look, if I get the number she took
I'm take her to the crib, I'mma put it in her ribs
I'mma put it in her anal, gettin' dome while I watch cable
Yung Locsta I'mma playa, she's a liver, her name Lisa
Kicked her out and ordered pizza, because I didn't eat her

[Hook: Locsta]
I gotta bunch of money, I show a lot of love
Yo' girl wanted to fuck me, I had to use a glove
My prices super low, I got the best plug
These niggas they don't like me, but I don't give a fuck
Gotdamn, that's some real nigga shit, aye
Gotdamn, that's a hustlin' ass clique, aye
Gotdamn, she's a Nothin' Ass Bitch, mane
Gotdamn, she's a Nothin' Ass Bitch, mane

[Verse 2: Teezyduh]
I'm from the home of the ratchets, ain't no plastics
Body snatchers lower caskets, cause the money is a must, gotta have it
I'm just at it, tryna make it happen, round here niggas pistol's clappin
Pistol packin, better use it, niggas dumpin', bitches stabbin'
I'm just rappin' tryna get out, 'fore I fuck around and get smoked
Fuckin' round with these 'fuck around' niggas ain't no joke
I got bitches tryna fuck around, they'll probably let me poke
But I'm too busy in the yo' my future bright, a nigga stoked
But hold on, on another note, my bitch she a gypsy
All money on the way in, I'm feelin like Nipsey
Cause the hustle is in me, my pockets is empty
But I'ma get it right back, give me a minute and I'll have plenty, right?
I'm wit Locsta and the Loc's but ain't no criminal
Crimson and Cream, reppin' Oklahoma, not no Seminole
Nothin' bout me subliminal, I tell it like it is
I ain't playin' with these kids, a nigga focused on his biz, huh?

[Hook]

[Outro: Locsta]
Yuh, aye
Gotdamn, she's a Nothin' Ass Bitch, mane
Nigga, you know who you are bitch
If you fuckin' two niggas, that's related, you dusty ho
Aye
If you fuckin' two niggas in the same apartment complex, bitch you'z a rat man
Y'all some dusty ass bitches man
Shout out to the bad hoes though
Know I fucks witcha'
Yes sir
Gizzle
Just had to make somethin' 4 them, 4 them ratchet ass bitches, mane
Had to do it for the dusty ass bitches, mane
Aye, aye, I think she got the mange
Let me quit playin' man
Selo, Gizzle, Go!
