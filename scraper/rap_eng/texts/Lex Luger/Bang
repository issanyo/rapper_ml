Throw your hood up, nigga

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
B-L-double O-D, right side flag, niggas know me
I'm green flag, bitch, that's Grove Street
Squeeze on my trigger till my gun OD
Ride on my enemies, niggas just into me
Niggas ain't have or function like me
Hundred grand chain, you ain't icy like me
R.I.P. to my nigga G-Baby
Got a gun seat behind me like my name Jay-Z
Can't no nigga play me
Up a nigga like some rabies
Got the whole hood like, "Flock crazy"
I'll paint your whole town red, make your little brother scream "su woo"
Make your little sister scream, "su woo", me and YG Hootie-Hoo, ooh
Frenchie, Juiceman, Gucc, Wooh, bet them boys gon' shoot, fool
Slim Dunk, Capp, and Kebo gon' shoot for free throws, free throws
Free my nigga T-Bo, I'll punch a nigga like I'm Deebo
Waka Flocka Flame, pussy nigga, what's banging?
In the club, throwing up signs, right hanging

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
We in this bitch throwing gang signs, man
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
We in this bitch throwing gang signs, man
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
We in this bitch throwing gang signs, man
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
We in this bitch throwing gang signs

[Verse 2: YG Hootie]
Ride on my enemies, throw them off in the sea
Know a lot of niggas really dream about getting me
Ride on niggas with the west side, though
I ain't fucking with you if you acting all finnicky
Bompton to Tennessee, keep me a mini chopper, flamed up
Me and Flocka, west side, my casa, I run
My house, my turf like the [?]
West side fucking with the down south
Red flags all at my shows
Used to kill, now we all about dope
Buy whips, put them all on fours
Still kill, but it's all about dope
Get tricky, so play by the rules
Look, homie, I'm from 142
Flip that pack, still grind some more
I love my hood and I love more dope
I'ma feed my hood with a spoon and a fork
Fuck with me, you gon' eat, let's go
Go against me, I'ma slit your throat
Get a rap check, buy weed, buy coke
I make shit pop in the deuce and the four
I'm the king around here, that's how shit go, nigga

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
We in this bitch throwing gang signs, man
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
We in this bitch throwing gang signs, man
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
We in this bitch throwing gang signs, man
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
We in this bitch throwing gang signs

[Verse 3: Slim Dunkin]
Nigga, hold up, don't act like you know me
Just cause you Blood don't make you my homie
Fuck what you claiming, your clique probably phony
Real mob shit, nigga, you can call me Tony
Nigga, I'm a shooter, gon' get your ass shot
Wak shoot for Gucc, Dunk shoot for Flock
Nigga, I'ma bang roulette till [?]
Wrong gang sign, nigga, palm that back
Whole clique goons, don't know how to act
Fetti got the Ruger, Ted got the mac
Pussy nigga swung when I turned my back
Hold on, DJ, bring that back
Pussy nigga swung when I turned my back
Chest shot, tell that nigga hold that
Knocked out his front seat, his ass come back
Don't check his ass, baby, don't come back
Natural born shooter, I'm the club party pooper
Yes, sir, I'm the Dunkin, but nah, I ain't a hooper
Natural born shooter, I'm the club party pooper
Yes, sir, I'm the Dunkin, but nah, I ain't a hooper

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
We in this bitch throwing gang signs, man
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
We in this bitch throwing gang signs, man
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
We in this bitch throwing gang signs, man
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
We in this bitch throwing gang signs
