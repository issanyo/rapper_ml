[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Ay girl, I see you with your friends and your ass out
Just left stage, 'bout to cash out
One more drink and I'mma pass out
Can’t nobody see me? It’s a blackout
Blackout, blackout
Can’t nobody see me?
Blackout, blackout
If you getting money, pull your cash out

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I said I'm turned up, maxed out
New money, but I just pulled a stash out
Huh, couldn't see me in a glass house
And my bitch way better than my last spouse
Hey, so tell me what you wanna do
Big bank take little bank, I'm Chase and bitch you are WAMU
I'm on some other shit, so can you please get off my stool?
I am the man up in this bitch, I do it big, give me my room
Or I could give the business, but this right here is none of y'all
Nobody could fuck with me, it must be the nuin y'all
Watch me throw it up, throw it up cause I can’t stomach y'all
I'm 'bout to take your bitch nigga and this is how I cum in her

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Diamonds in my chain, Whoopi Goldberg, black as shit
Black Breitling all on my wrist, bitch I'm Bernie Macking it
Get some Geicko for that ho, before it be a accident
Cause I be shitting on these niggas, like I took a laxative
I break a bitch down, like I break a brick down
Chopper with a drum, ho 86 rounds
I could make it rain and make a hater sit down
And I ain't tryna save no chick, I'm tryna make a bitch drown
And I be swimming all in that money, diving all in that paper
Black phantom with no tint, styling all on them haters
Your team vs. my team, Cavaliers vs. Lakers
I make a movie all on your bitch, scream free TIP I take her

[Chorus]
