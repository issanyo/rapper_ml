[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I see this nigga repping, right side hanging
Flamed up, banging, what set your ass claiming?
G check, G check, G check, G check
G check, G check, G check, G check
I ran up on this nigga, who your big homie?
Asked him what his lingo, he said I don't even know
G check, G check, G check, G check
G check, G check, G check, G check

[Verse 1: YG Hootie]
Ran up on this nigga, finna check the boy's status
Looked him right up in his eyes like, "Nigga, where you from?
Who your big homie? What block you niggas bang?
Who you know up on that yard? Talking real big homies"
Respect all the riders, G checking all the phonies
Ain't fucking with no suckers, they lying when they say they know me
I'm from west side Bompton
God bless all my riders, death to my enemies
I'm taking niggas' flags, niggas better leave the spot
For all the niggas on my block, it's like me snitching to the cops
Out of line, you get disciplined, better do some missions, then
I didn't get my name for free, fuck, I had to get it in

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I see this nigga repping, right side hanging
Flamed up, banging, what set your ass claiming?
G check, G check, G check, G check
G check, G check, G check, G check
I ran up on this nigga, who your big homie?
Asked him what his lingo, he said I don't even know
G check, G check, G check, G check
G check, G check, G check, G check

[Verse 2: Bo Deal]
Nigga fronting, I'll hit him up, nigga, what? We can get a mut
Pussy niggas ain't real as us, just like the candle, I lit him up
Always talking that tough shit, I ain't the nigga to fuck with
Choppers loading up, niggas folding up, Superman couldn't duck this
Bo Deal, big boss, VL is all I know
Catch you in that field, hoe, stingers rolling up real slow
Niggas breaking out scared as fuck, tucking tails, you a man or what?
I ain't think so, cock it, squeeze, I'm dropping everything standing up
Lay down or get laid down, 40 Cal. and AK down
What you claim? Better say it now
You got a gun? Better spray it now
Or you will get your ass knocked off when the Glock cough
Topped off, dumb dumbs will leave you burning like hot sauce

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I see this nigga repping, right side hanging
Flamed up, banging, what set your ass claiming?
G check, G check, G check, G check
G check, G check, G check, G check
I ran up on this nigga, who your big homie?
Asked him what his lingo, he said I don't even know
G check, G check, G check, G check
G check, G check, G check, G check

[Verse 3: Joe Moses]
It's money over everything, five-four wedding ring
Married to the mob, all I know is Mighty Brim Gang
B's up, what it do? Five, zero, five, two
Thirty-seven, sixty-two, the set is like a fucking zoo
Lions and them tigers, I be mobbing like them YG'
AK'll chop a nigga, silence when that chopper squeeze
Fuck them, Waka Flocka, All Out is like the new mob
Hootie, say, "Fuck them", new West, this is Brick Squad
Down like I'm 'posed to be, niggas don't get close to me
I'm Blooding, bitch, this Blood's on the set, this how this 'posed to be
We thugging, bitch, we 'posed to be, we killing shit, you 'posed to grieve
Suge Gotti, tell them who got the streets

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I see this nigga repping, right side hanging
Flamed up, banging, what set your ass claiming?
G check, G check, G check, G check
G check, G check, G check, G check
I ran up on this nigga, who your big homie?
Asked him what his lingo, he said I don't even know
G check, G check, G check, G check
G check, G check, G check, G check
