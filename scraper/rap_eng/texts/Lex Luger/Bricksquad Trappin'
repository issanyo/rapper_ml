[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame & OJ da Juiceman]
Wooh, Frenchie, Juice, what it do man?
Slim, what's up?
Kebo, what's up?
Capp, what it do?
Yeah
Hootie, what's up man?
Juiceman in this motherfucker
Flocka Flame
We strapped up on this one, you feel me?
Bricksquad is in the building
Bricksquad, cuz
That's Flocka Flame and that's Juiceman
That's two pieces of Bricksquad, you feel me?
Put them together, that's a win

[Chorus: OJ da Juiceman]
Hundred thousand pounds of midget crammed up in a Magnum
Two hundred thousand chickens and they still wrapped in plastic
Juiceman and Flocka Flame, Bricksquad trapping
Juiceman and Flocka Flame, Bricksquad trapping
Hundred thousand pounds of midget crammed up in a Magnum
Two hundred thousand chickens and they still wrapped in plastic
Juiceman and Flocka Flame, Bricksquad trapping
Juiceman and Flocka Flame, Bricksquad trapping

[Verse 1: OJ da Juiceman]
Bricksquad trapping, two hundred out the plastic
Ooh, I'm trapping with a Magnum, put you in a casket
Easter egg fresh like I'm jumping out the basket
Six rings on like Juice done played some basketball
Yes, my house is like a mall
I'm Murry shoe walking and your hoe just want my balls
My Hummer on them inches and it's tall like Pau Gasol
With this orange juice chain and this jewelry with no [?]
And it's Guacamole World, so Juice can buy it all
And my right wrist like a light and my left wrist London Falls
And it's Guacamole World, so Juice can buy it all
And my right wrist like a light, left wrist like it's London Falls

[Chorus: OJ da Juiceman]
Hundred thousand pounds of midget crammed up in a Magnum
Two hundred thousand chickens and they still wrapped in plastic
Juiceman and Flocka Flame, Bricksquad trapping
Juiceman and Flocka Flame, Bricksquad trapping
Hundred thousand pounds of midget crammed up in a Magnum
Two hundred thousand chickens and they still wrapped in plastic
Juiceman and Flocka Flame, Bricksquad trapping
Juiceman and Flocka Flame, Bricksquad trapping

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Yeah, I'm high tonight
Whole clique down to fight, front me that off white
[?], shawty bite, trap nigga, that's right
Diamond bird green, [?] Juice, Flocka get it right
My right ring like this, Warner Brothers signed him
Flocka! Waka! Flocka! Waka! Waka! Flocka!
Waka! Waka! What?! What? Flocka! Waka! Juice! Flocka!
Waka! Flocka! Flocka!
Bricksquad and I ain't gotta say shit
My left wrist sick, my right wrist sick
Shawty's baby mama chewing a hole up on my dick
Whip white, rims white, codeine, good night
Four mixtapes, got a young nigga booming

[Chorus: OJ da Juiceman]
Hundred thousand pounds of midget crammed up in a Magnum
Two hundred thousand chickens and they still wrapped in plastic
Juiceman and Flocka Flame, Bricksquad trapping
Juiceman and Flocka Flame, Bricksquad trapping
Hundred thousand pounds of midget crammed up in a Magnum
Two hundred thousand chickens and they still wrapped in plastic
Juiceman and Flocka Flame, Bricksquad trapping
Juiceman and Flocka Flame, Bricksquad trapping
