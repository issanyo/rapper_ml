[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame & B. Smeezee]
One stack, two stacks, three stacks, four
Five stacks, six stacks, I need more
Y'all got guns, but we got more
More, more, more, more
One bitch, two bitch, three bitch, four
One bitch, two bitch, three bitch, more
Keep them hoes coming, nigga, we need more
More, more, more, more

[Verse 1: B. Smeezee & Waka Flocka Flame]
Smeezee getting money still, I need more
One stacks, two stacks, double that: four
Come with 15's, AK's for war
Y'all got guns, but we got more
Goons here, goons there, everybody strapped
Smeezee, Waka Flocka Flame, everybody trap
Round of applause, leave everybody clapped
Go sixteen bars when I say that it's a wrap
We shoot first, leave everybody shot
B. Smeezee got them, get everybody got
Waka Flocka Flame leave everybody hot
B. Smeezee shot them, leave everybody shot
Money gangbang, bang asking for me
Anybody get it, I'm B. Smeezee
Us niggas rich, but y'all niggas poor
Money, money, money, nigga, we get more

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame & B. Smeezee]
One stack, two stacks, three stacks, four
Five stacks, six stacks, I need more
Y'all got guns, but we got more
More, more, more, more
One bitch, two bitch, three bitch, four
One bitch, two bitch, three bitch, more
Keep them hoes coming, nigga, we need more
More, more, more, more

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Hundred grand for the fuzzy, I ain't popping, nigga
Disrespectful shit, I'll take your mama shopping, nigga
Blowing up my phone like, "Flocka, get it popping, nigga"
I got bitches like LL, hoes call me great
Shawty charge six hundred for the pussy, shit, I'll charge a stack
You only owe me four hundred, bring my money back
I can't pay for pussy, where the fuck they do that at?
Shout out to some real queens, niggas like [?] supreme
I get Queens love, you can call me big Joe
I change cars every month just to stunt, hoe
I'm from Riverdale, it ain't fucking hard to tell
Cocaine, X pills, and some dummy bales
M-O-R-E, the light-skinned dreadhead Eazy-E
Little bruh Chaz would kill you for a quarter key
Brother from another mother, B. Smeezee
Hitsquad, Bricksquad, I'ma die So Icey

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame & B. Smeezee]
One stack, two stacks, three stacks, four
Five stacks, six stacks, I need more
Y'all got guns, but we got more
More, more, more, more
One bitch, two bitch, three bitch, four
One bitch, two bitch, three bitch, more
Keep them hoes coming, nigga, we need more
More, more, more, more
