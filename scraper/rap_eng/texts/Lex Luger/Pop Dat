[Hook]
Pop that for me, pop that for me
Pop that for me, pop that for me
Pop that for me, pop that for me
Pop that for me, pop that for me

[Verse 1]
Baby pop that for me
My time is not cheap
I got a lot in my pockets
Stuff it up with moneys and weed, yeah
You fuckin’ right I’m a star
Fuck around and ash on my wings
Right now I need you to pop it
But baby don’t step on my feet
Goddamit, got rent on my feet
I don’t want to hear ‘bout what you won’t do
Baby you can miss me with that don’t do
Drop to the floor like I told you
Baby what make you think I don’t want you?
Oh my, let me give it to you like I owe you
Then drop you off, I don’t know you
Hop out the bed baby
Grip on the head baby
I just had to hit you with it
Don’t you, don’t you, won’t you, won’t
It ain’t no pressure, let it flow
Lots of bitches, lots of hoes
And they can’t wait to show me no
I don’t want to send you off or hold you, no
Take your time, take it slow
Clap back at me in slow-mo
You know what I want

[Hook]
Pop that for me, pop that for me
Pop that for me, pop that for me
Pop that for me, pop that for me
Pop that for me, pop that for me

[Hook]
Pop that for me, pop that for me
Pop that for me, pop that for me
Pop that for me, pop that for me
Pop that for me, pop that for me

[Verse 2]
Two bad bitches wanna take turns with me
Like I won’t do everything to ‘em but kiss ‘em
I don’t buy it, I don’t need it
That bag, might rent it
Can’t make love to you, got fifteen minutes
I pulled up in a 600, all tinted
Act like you seen somethin’, all high, all litty
Aww man in the air, dead man in my denims
I’m taking my time ‘cause I ride with my pistol, yeah
Break it down like a kush bowl in the living room
I should put a strip pole in the living room
You know how the shit go in the living room
One real nigga, six hoes in the living room
Type of lifestyle make a broke nigga eavesdrop
Brought the plug to the hotel, make the suite hot
Rug burn when she gave me head, said her knees hot
I’m the real thing in real life, baby he’s not
I just turned a rental car to a weed spot
I need you to give me deep neck ‘til my knees lock
Did your mama raise a good girl or a freak thot?
Get you high, blow the gas smoke out the T top
Big bank take little bank, nigga please stop
Yeah she probably pop it for you, but you pay a fee huh?
Yeah they always talkin’ ‘bout it, but them niggas weak huh?

[Bridge]
Oh why, oh why oh why
Pop that for me
Oh why
Pop that for me

[Hook]
Pop that for me, pop that for me
Pop that for me, pop that for me
Pop that for me, pop that for me
Pop that for me, pop that for me
