(Light's out, nigga!)
It's clap on, clap off in this bitch
Don't make me turn off ya own switch
(Light's out, nigga!)
You couldn't see me in the daytime with a flashlight
I got my cash right, so
(Light's out, nigga!)
I don't see nobody x8
(Light's out, nigga!)

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
I walk up in the spot, and see tonight we have a packed house
We are in the building, and it's rocking like a crack house
All the sexy women wearing dresses with they backs out
My neck is usually lit up, but tonight we have a black out
Call me Tom Edison cus I'm about light up
My head is in the clouds, feel like it just took a flight up
They tryna slow me down, like that syrup in them white cups
Clear that I'mma bubble, like you shook a fucking Sprite up
I don't see nobody, I ain't going blind though
I don't see nobody, stopping me from mine, yo
We the Money Gang, we throw up dollar signs ho
My gun from out of town, make you change your state of mind ho

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
Bottles of Rose keep finding its way to my section
And groups of pretty bitches with them light skin complexion
Told her I'mma kill and I use magnum protection
I just slide up in it baby, that's lethal injection
I'm about that money
Pussies were a food chase
Ho's will have you tied up, bitch I ain't no shoe lace
Smirking in my black shades
My BB and cool face
But I will fix you niggas
You make me get my toolcase
I don't see nobody, but it ain't my vision
I see I'm what it is, and you are what it isn't
Light's out, niggas
Assume position
With my eyes closed I see there is no competition
