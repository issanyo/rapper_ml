[Verse 1]
I been getting this since back then like my name was Gillie
Grow a sumo on my face, call me Flocka-Philly
Nigga, what's the deally? Let me know what's brackin'
Ain't no cameras 'round here, nigga, stop that acting
Bitch, I'm 'bout that action, subtract 'em like a fraction
Everybody packing like Nick Minaj ass
Kush smell like garbage, nigga, pay some homage
Dick got her hooked, now that bitch call me phonics
Mizay Management, shit, that my mother
Yellow diamond Fozzie chain, shit, that bitch like butter
Bitch, I'm like no other rap nigga
You can call me cut throat-ass trap nigga

[Chorus]
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bitch I'm bustin' at 'em
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bitch I'm bustin' at 'em
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bitch I'm bustin' at 'em

Bow, bow, bow, bow, bitch I'm bustin' at 'em
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bitch I'm bustin' at 'em
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bitch I'm bustin' at 'em
Ain't no talkin', homie, I'm just bustin' at 'em

[Verse 2]
KY Engineering, Fozzie get them staring
Fuzzy diamond earrings, M6 what I'm steering
Work up to next year and bring back diamond earrings
Yes, I'm John Deere'n, nigga, who you scaring?
Shawty, I'm tatted up, you can call me Inky
All I do is get brains, you can call me Pinky
My crew just like Winky, right, nigga
I got my swagger right, nigga
I heard they got a price tag on a nigga's head
You got a better chance snitching, nigga, going Ded
You dug your own grave, let me make your death bed
Suicide, shawrty shot his own self dead

[Chorus]
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bitch I'm bustin' at 'em
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bitch I'm bustin' at 'em
