S. Beezy

I'm fresh forever
Can I get a witness
Drop a can of paint
Grind more business
I'm the type to rock yellow diamonds that match my car
You the type to live under a rock, Patrick Star
And i might win some people over with that flow right here
Feeling serena any week and so that shows right there
I'm ahead of this music game by light years
Im the definition of swag bitch it's right here
I'm Gudda Gudda just like YM signed me
I'm the sun in the summer, you can't outshine me
They not in my task brackets so I cannot mention it
Bitch look at my dashboard, I bet that bitch digital
They saying damn
Song stucked in they head
Pussy nigga I got the game locked just like a dread
He say he was harder?
I say he was flexin
I pull a VIP with 30 freaks and drop top lexus
And name a rapper and I will kill em
I'm 19 now
With 19 million
Back then it was all a dream
These days I'm feeling like martin luther king

Digital digital everything digital
Shorty check the dashboard in my lambo and it's digital
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital
Digital digital everything digital
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty look at my dash and I bet that thing digital
Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital

Shit on any rapper
I can bet a million
My chain turns colors
I call it chameleon
Hurtin niggas feelings
I'm in they mouth like fillings
I'm in the air chillin
Right about a ceiling
I keep making hits
While you rappers stealing
I hustle 20 million
And im still dealing
Leather wood grippin
On a money mission
Got my paper flipping
Shoutout to my coalition
Niggas hatin on me
But I gives a fuck
Snakes in the grass
So I keep it cut
20 ace on the vehicle is grown up
Engine in my trunk
When I showed up
They said they had a dungeon
Cuz I know they creepin
Money is my language
Now speak it or seek it
You fucking a white girl
You beat it a bit
Call her girlfriends over
We watching her eat it
At the top of my game
Till they come defeat me
I'm on my may-weather shit cuz im undefeated
It's me and my money
There's nothing in between it
And nigga im the best bitch and I fucking mean it

Digital digital everything digital
Shorty check the dashboard in my lambo and it's digital
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital
Digital digital everything digital
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty look at my dash and I bet that thing digital
Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital
On a money mission
