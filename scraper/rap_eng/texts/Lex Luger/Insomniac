(Verse)

Get straight to it
Don't waste time
Time is money
Don't waste mine
With the flow nigga
I'm a sharp shooter
Beyond the ark
Or baseline
I run the game
No knee sprains
Ball hard
Like King James
Back then niggas
Didn't know me
I swear it's funny
How things change

(Hook)
I never sleep
Ever...
I'm a insomniac
If you looking for me
You can find me
Where the money at

I hustle
I hustle
I hustle
I get it x3

I'm focused on cash
Nigga just stay in lane
Y'all niggas
Be moving too fast
Niggas can't zurk
With the boy
Oh no you niggas will crash
You in the minus
To me that's a plus
Subtract then you add
No pen or no pad
It's nothing to spazz
I'm beast nigga
I'm no myth
Gold Chains
Gold Wrist
Got a rolex
It don't tick
And I got ice
That cold shit
If ain't loud
Don't roll shit
I ain't for no ho shit
The Flow automatic
This the whole clip
I could turn a
Yatch into a ghost-ship

(Hook)

I never sleep
Ever...
I'm a insomniac
If you looking for me
You can find me
Where the money at

I hustle
I hustle
I hustle
I get it x3

(Verse)

Christine I'm kill em all
That's a my word
Just wait for me
I show love always
Even when they got hate
For me
If you hear me
Then Pray for me
If you fake
Stay from from me
I been a boss
Since day one
All I do is make money!
