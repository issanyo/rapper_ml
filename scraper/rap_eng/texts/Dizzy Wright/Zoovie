She’s switching on me
At my table sitting on me sipping slowly
Rolling back to back go and hit this weed you won’t be disappointed
Go and hit this weed (x2)
Hit this weed you won’t be disappointed
She’s switching on me at my table sitting on me woah

(Verse 1)
Wow last night was a zoovie (x2)
I was turned in the uber ? before we even got to it
Walked in with my friends looking for the ATM
Big booty but the waist slim I want all of them!
Turn vibes to the sunrise baby girl I’m on one (yeah I’m on one)
We got the loud pack heard the bathroom man got the raps I want one
Tell the bartender we need more one’s, slapping that ass like I beat the drum
Bottles is coming we getting’ drunk, don’t judge me we tearing the city up!
Told the bitch don’t be choosie all my nigga’s get stoovie
Tables served as VIP is poppin’ while I’m watching all the booty moving
It’s the experience, I’m loving the way that your body is hearing me
Fuck being innocent, you can say that I was feeling it cause

(Hook)
She’s switching on me
At my table sitting on me sipping slowly
Rolling back to back go and hit this weed you won’t be disappointed
Go and hit this weed (x2)
Hit this weed you won’t be disappointed
She’s switching on me at my table sitting on me woah

(Verse 2)

Love the shit fo sho, chilling with my bro’s, everybody got them dollars on em’
Table poppin’ everybody drinking you exclusive when you got the gwalla on ya
In three days I made thirty grand so tonight I’m about to pay somebody rent
You flexing with your flexibility, got me feeling like this make a whole lot of sense
Baby shake that ass, just got paid in cash everything I’m doing  going up
Experience the live of the zoovie, imma give you a roll if you rolling up

Ballers on me and we came to play, make me want to hit the pussy different ways

At my table sitting on me sipping slowly
Rolling back to back go and hit this weed you won’t be disappointed
