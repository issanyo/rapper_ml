[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
A nigga just sent that link over to that first video

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
They ain't used to Vegas heat they ain't know it got this hot

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
You been missing out you been missing out
Dropping hits for years I been switching styles
Grew up in this shit I was young when I learned the music biz
Who would of ever thought
That I would stick this out and become this big
No one still moving we on one
But only on them Monday's we gon' fill them Go Funds
That's that motivation music that I let roll off my tongue
So you got to hit me when you come
And can't keep the peace then don't come
Okay okay let's go
I'm just another addition
You don't want to live my life
You just looking at the high lights
This a 24 hour mission
No sleep no assitance
Now they tryna live the night life
Got the Sin City tripping

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
They ain't used to Vegas heat they ain't know it got this hot

[Verse 2: Reezy]
Heard he got 100s on 100s on 100s they never can count them out
Went to touring coast to coach from sleeping on couch to couch
Hop out the foreign hop in the driver it got about a 1,000 miles
I feel important with never match whenever I'm out and about
I keep the ice on my neck it stay about a 100 degrees
Might bet a 100 on the Cavs and I took the under for Jesus
Vegas night life money I think I'll take me a piece
I done left the water running you see it all on my sleeves
Rollie on my wrist can't hear it go tick tock
Prime time shit got work in the zip lock
Prime time shit diamonds dancing when I touch down
Fans in the bleachers
Got bands when they see us

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
