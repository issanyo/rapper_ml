[Verse 1]
Aye yo I'm Biggie Hypnotized mixed with Nas
With the spirit of Bob Marley and a Rastafari god
Y'all niggas on that whack shit, y'all don't even make me nod
Coming out of Las Vegas, I hope I make it against the odds
Waking up on a job, I fell asleep while I was working
Niggas stuck on jerkin', I'm stuck on what's really working
Little Dizzy out here hurting, living on my own
Seventeen years old, hit this studio that I call home
Eighteen I'm on that function shit, get money shit
What are dreams for?
By nineteen I see I attracted the wrong people
By twenty I'm getting blasted and expressing life through this needle
Twenty-one I travel, rip stages like The Beatles
Made fans, thinking back when we made plans
Started off a dream, growing, but still the same man
What's the game plan? Originality creates
Criminal casualties, you tryna' battle with the case
Yo I'm good, man I'm good
Saying ? , they had to formulate it
See what I saw they couldn't orchestrate it
See when I die, know I'mma mean more to Vegas
Cause they gon' do their research and re-evaluate my work

[Verse 2]
Yo, they say life is a game, hope you can play it well
If I ever get unhappy, I'mma pull a Dave Chapelle
Money ain't enough to make it well, if I can't face myself
Keep it one-hundred, running from who you becoming
Anxious to see what's next because it's always something coming
Youngin' you don't know the half, be happy you have something
Niggas want the most, get a little and then they brag on it
Karma's right, so now niggas want me to feel bad for 'em
Salty as ever, my feelings all in the situation
You niggas only give me inspiration
Call it giving back, I'm sitting back, emotions more ?
Mad as fuck, no one to talk to so I'm just smoking
Music got me open, maybe I'm too outspoken
But I'm so fucking devoted, it's all a part of my passion
You fabricate the truth, you choose your rappers off they fashion
I'm just tryna' be the motherfucking package
