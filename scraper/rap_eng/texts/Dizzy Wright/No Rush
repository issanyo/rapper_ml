[Intro]
You don't understand
Let me tell you somethin'

[Hook]
They looking at me like they can tell I had enough
I looking back at 'em (I am)
I ain't in no rush (No way)
Baby play my playlist every time she rollin' up (Sock it to me)
I'm trying to provide that real
This gon' get you high for real
They looking at me like they can tell I had enough
I looking back at 'em (I am)
I ain't in no rush (No way)
Baby play my playlist every time she rollin' up (Sock it to me)
I'm trying to provide that real
This gon' get you high for real

[Verse 1]
This gon' open up your pineal gland
Clutch like I got Micheal hands
Didn't sign a deal for the nice advance
Grew up in Mike Tyson land
We bet on them boxers, dog
Party until them cops get called
Gon' be this way 'til my casket drop
Stop it, dog, you not that hard
Post up like boy flashin' shots, we back in stock, no back and forth
Check the back of my jersey, dog
You see my name but where is yours?
Teamwork make the dream work, wisdom got me moonlight dancin'
Word to Larry, I been staying healthy, high, and handsome
Makin' Dizzy OG anthems
Just look at how they look at me
They look for me, not knowing I can feel my mind expanding
I be with them flashy guys
Roll my blunts with dabs in size
I'm not one of these little niggas that's been taking their life for granted

[Hook]
They looking at me like they can tell I had enough
I looking back at em (I am)
I ain't in no rush (No way)
Baby play my playlist every time she rollin up (Sock it to me)
I'm trying to provide that real
This gon' get you high for real
They looking at me like they can tell I had enough
I looking back at em (I am)
I ain't in no rush (No way)
Baby play my playlist every time she rollin up (Sock it to me)
I'm trying to provide that real
This gon' get you high for real

[Verse 2]
Leave my crib, I'm packed for days
For high vibration that we raise
Pullin' crowds, release my passion to show ya'll why I act this way
They brought in that crack cocaine
Ain't no black man have no planes
I'm trying start my own airlines though
And not just for them platinum names
Who look out like we look out
When school get out, we save these kids
Money don't bring you happiness
My nigga, we gotta get in front of this
English word hypnosis got this strong determination
Calcified, they want me to close it
Nah, nah, nah, we gon' keep this open
Thinking about my life as I burn this sage
We follow the Native American way
We know what they stole
What you thinking you praise?
Every year they got us stuck in a maze
God damn, God damn
If I kneel, I'm a son of a bitch
Whole country goin' ham
Gentrification still exists, just look at Flint, come on now

[Hook]
They looking at me like they can tell I had enough
I looking back at em (I am)
I ain't in no rush (No way)
Baby play my playlist every time she rollin up (Sock it to me)
I'm trying to provide that real
This gon' get you high for real
They looking at me like they can tell I had enough
I looking back at em (I am)
I ain't in no rush (No way)
Baby play my playlist every time she rollin up (Sock it to me)
I'm trying to provide that real
This gon' get you high for real
