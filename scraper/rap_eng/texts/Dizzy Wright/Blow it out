Dealing with these problems they don't know about
They wanna ask how I do it, I show em how
I roll it up light it up and Blow it out
I roll it up light it up and Blow it out

Fighting all these demons put us all up when I'm down
Asking when I'm leaving but I ain't going now
I'm trying to find a reason not to stay up in the house
I cop me a zone and you know we blow it down
Daddy wasn't home, he ain't nowhere to be find
Left him in the dust , now we Midwest bound
I'm eating all your crust I'm a fucking blood hound
Someone will you bring me the finest stuff in town?

Dealing with these problems they don't know about
They wanna ask how I do it, I show em how
I roll it up light it up and Blow it out
I roll it up light it up and Blow it out x2

(Dizzy)
Uh, I just met up with my weed man now I'm bout to smash out
Went to an eighth to a quarter now its a half ounce
Smoke, I been smoking too closely
Niggas talking down hitting me with the okey dokey
If you got a better way then you should show me
Bitches wanna hold me I'm too closed off so take your clothes off for the homies
Its Hotel strippers and these dispensary girls all over the world
Connect for the mutual spect
Nevertheless the weed staying fresher than me
Cop every two days THC and I'm sexing the beat
Fuck it, smoke going under my bucket
Accept it, you can't smoke like me cuz you can't handle the budget I been

Dealing with these problems they don't know about
They wanna ask how I do it, I show em how
I roll it up light it up and Blow it out
I roll it up light it up and Blow it out x2

See we back up in the lab doing this work with pen and pad
Look who cooking beats like its fucking breaking bad
Madness in the back eager to make em space
Got this grin on my face and Battles evil laugh
Quick to make em sick, begging a teacher for that pass
Gripping and groaping stomach think they nauseas from the movement
Nike be the sponsor cuz I do, I do it
My green is a monster , pasta brewing
Ain't fucking with them nick sacks, Patrick Ewing
They thinking that we rich , in what sense is you foolish?
I got more class than these straight A students
And I'm finna cop the cap like these AK shootas

Dealing with these problems they don't know about
They wanna ask how I do it, I show em how
I roll it up light it up and Blow it out
I roll it up light it up and Blow it out x2
