[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I don't know why these niggas think they got to do the most
Stand back nigga don't come close
'Cause y'all fucking up the game
I don't know why these niggas think they got to do the most
Stand back nigga don't come close
'Cause y'all fucking up the game

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
If you following me, I just need to hear all them yeses
Valuable methods
Eye contact for the respect when ever requested
Like I was elected
I'm quick to accepting collections
Hungry for seconds
To eat at this table you better be in control of them pleasures
I got the sauce like I had some and ordered extra
You better get with it
I spread that world peace like I'm better
This is big business I'm talking CEO's and trend setters
Came when they wouldn't let us
We never let it effect us
Family man I like them holidays and ugly Christmas sweaters
On my down time I like to smoke a pound and switch them letters
I'm a simple man
But how they get away with murder on his schedule?
It's time for the golden age we headed for the golden medal
Way better than my older level
I'm a over dedicated nigga
Yeah the rebel Vegas nigga
I'm hottest in the coldest weather
You must ain't learn the game or you don't know better
It's funny 'cause

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I don't know why these niggas think they got to do the most
Stand back nigga don't come close
'Cause y'all fucking up the game
I don't know why these niggas think they got to do the most
Stand back nigga don't come close
'Cause y'all fucking up the game

Message got to be universal but organic

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Love all the time
Spread that peace and love all the time
Fuck fake love and fake raps is where we draw the line
I'm still moving you standing still getting parking fines
I grind hard so I can enjoy my son and daughter time
Family man I am yeah I'm slapping Cam
Then I Dipset to get it ASAP R.I.P to Yams
Crazy how the flow sounding different already
I'm keeping it G and she keeping it sexy
But them boys in the hood thinking they ready
For Dizzy
Creating enemies yo and now you screaming for Ricky
I'm Tory Lanez litty
I know what they want like Russ before the fame hitting
Where niggas do the most yo I can see the lame in him
And everyone that came with him
And all suck a clone dick
You don't, I need a bone ripped 'cause

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I don't know why these niggas think they got to do the most
Stand back nigga don't come close
'Cause y'all fucking up the game
I don't know why these niggas think they got to do the most
Stand back nigga don't come close
'Cause y'all fucking up the game
I don't know why these niggas think they got to do the most
Stand back nigga don't come close
'Cause y'all fucking up the game
I don't know why these niggas think they got to do the most
Stand back nigga don't come close
'Cause y'all fucking up the game

Y'all fucking up the game
Y'all fucking up the game
Y'all fucking up the game man
