[Verse 1]
Yiggity Yamp
Right back on top of things
Blowing up without dropping names
And I'm lifted
Locked the game but if I go down the Hopsin lane
I guarantee I'll Marshawn Lynch it
Y'all ain't ready for the young man
Beast Mode like I'm done playing
Heard they feinding for the next big thing
Shit, well I'm looking like I need to come and fill that position
Listen, can't wait for y'all
Either I'm finna find a way or I'll make the way
People that said that they got me and then they forgot me
Guess what?
Today's the day that I'm a save the day
And you gon' watch because you paved the way
The hate make me better
Now I'm happy, smoking good and motivated
To keep running this city forever
I love to rap, Dizzy Wright stepping up to bat
They hope in fact, that nigga strike out
But that never will happen, they hating
So I Jackie Robinson them with a smile
Ahead of these suckers by miles
I told you from jump that that sucker shit wasn't allowed (not allowed)
Everywhere I go turn into Vegas, now it's time for y'all to get wild

[Hook]
But believe everywhere I go they spread my name, the more that I spread this game
I swear everywhere I go, they go insane, roll up the mary jane
Everywhere I go turn into Vegas, now it's time for y'all to get wild
Stay on it, live life in the moment
Or you could just roll up and sit on a cloud
I swear it's everywhere I go (go) go (go)
Right back on top of things
Everywhere I go (go) go (go)
Right back on top of things
Everywhere I go turn into Vegas
Now it's time for y'all to get wild (wild)
Time for y'all to get wild (wild)
Time for y'all to get wild (wild)

[Verse 2]
I heard they like, "Who would have thought, Dizzy would even come far (far)"
And Pac may not have changed the world, but I'm that state of mind he sparked (sparked)
So let me hit you with the heart to heart, from dark to light
I'm headed for my destination (destination)
Treat me right, I might take you with me
If not take the chance of me fucking up your reputation
I'm next (refreshing statements)
Tell you what you don't wanna hear until your breath is taken
Took you down the golden ages with some complications
Nigga what more you want?
You want a one hit wonder or an artist that got more than one?
You need to make up your mind (mind)
Cause I'm constantly taking my time (time)
You fucking with me, then you leaving that fake shit behind
(Uh-Oh) Bringing the 702 to the building
Why they tryna turn the sky into a ceiling (ceiling)
These niggas is too in they feelings
So I don't want no compliments, I'm dominant
It's time for me to start trolling (trolling)
Stoner chicks is so legit, we just line em up and go bowling
Girls everywhere I go

[Hook]

Or you could just roll up and sit on a cloud
