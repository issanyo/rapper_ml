[Verse 1]
Ayo, this kid in Australia said he idolized me
If you don't know why then it's time to watch me
A young papi with the confidence of Rocky in a boxing match
Early mornings, practicing my rhymes, 13 rocking a stocking cap
Skinny nigga, I told my reflection I'll never settle
Said if I gain some weight then I would one day try to wrestle
Wanted to play ball and be a UNLV rebel
When I let my talent go to waste cause I couldn't keep up my grades
What a shame
Now I'm living out my second dream, grown into some shit you've never seen
Now I'm onto better things
It just goes to show when you travel a lot and you be on the road
We all striving to be comfortable and happy
But in life we go the distance
A major part in life is building the life you wanna live with
I know we lack patience, but you gotta stay consistent
Only you can slow you down, turn your dreams into commitments
Making sense with a sentence, Golden Age and I'm vintage
1990 to now, what we doin', they did it
You could be fooled in a minute
I'm just tryna talk that shit until I'm finished
The lost soul that's protected by my religion
I represent World Peace

[Hook]
Lately I've been feeling a certain way
Peace signs in every picture that I take
I represent World Peace
Smoking weed until the feeling goes away
Spreading love until I'm in and out my day
I represent World Peace

[Verse 2]
I'm extremely excited, without it hidin'
Niggas see me smilin'
But y'all niggas don't know the half of it
I'm talking bout a kid that grew up without havin' shit
And sorted out a plan, and then turned into a man
Y'all understand the fans, and how fans follow the artist
But what if one man give em something other than trends?
What you recommend, what you steppin' in?
Who you follow, what you represent, nigga what set you in?
Man we all started from the bottom
Started with a problem, before I was ever crawlin'
I was born into my miseries
Came out with my hidden talents, now the rest is history
Riding, but if you ain't providing, that don't mean shit to me
You could be the hardest nigga walkin'
But the hardest niggas working is the bosses
Keep it authentic, cause the image got you confused
Anybody would tell you it's a lose lose
Nigga do you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I just wanna give you something you can keep in mind
Be strong, don't let nothing disturb yo peace of mind
Read between the lines, teaching men to rhyme
You can't change overnight, we all need some time
Homie, don't act like I ain't out here on my ones and twos
Yo fundamentals was rented, and it's a bunch of you
Me, I been the same since my momma was buying lunchables
Grew through some functions, respected cause I'm lovable
Think good thoughts, speak good words
Take good actions, yeah that's what the world deserves
A man in power, that's gon' empower the people first
And Howard College, they listen, came all the way from the dirt
Agree to disagree, judge me cause I'd rather have them legalize
A plant, then feed the people nicotine
Sell the devil's juice, and they gon' support it by any means
On they TV screens, nigga please
I represent World Peace

[Hook]
