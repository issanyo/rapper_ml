[Intro: Reezy]
Ayy, whoa

[Chorus: Reezy]
I'm in, I'm in tune with it, headin' to the Moon with it (Moon with it)
High vibrations, radiatin', I can't lose with it (let's go, I can't lose with it)
Got a [?] drippin' water, she come through with it (drip, drip)
I'm in tune with it (aye), I'm in tune with it (I'm in tune with it)
I'm in, I'm in tune with it, headin' to the moon with it (to the moon with it)
High vibrations, radiatin', I can't lose with it (I can't)
Got a [?] drippin' water, she come through with it (drip, drip)
I'm in tune with it (aye), I'm in tune with it (I'm in tune with it)

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I'm in tune with your water signs, we jump off them lines
Told my goddess, hope you in your element like I'm in mine
They tryna figure out how a guy like this, can twist to make one whole album, mayne
I get it, I get it, you think you got it, 'cause you think it's nothin' you got to change
Ain't that the truth? I can't hide you from your ancient roots (I can't)
Waste your time, that's just somethin' that we ain't gon' do (I won't)
This earth sign had my kids, I gave her life, she gave me two
I'm in tune with it, don't trip I pay my dues, yeah

[Verse 2: Price]
Yeah, pay my dues, ten million couldn't persuade the dude
To be fine and betray the crew like Reez, Demrick, Diz, Hop to name a few
My daddy still crippin', I got banger roots
The homies still trippin', yeah they bangin' too
In a dark place where my life was at, I found the price was black, I had to change the views
Vans on my feet, don't scan my shoes
Net neutrality, they'll make us pay the view
The government comin' with the same excuse
My girl sendin' links so we stay in tune
I rap like '99 Busta Rhymes
She packed up the bowl like it's supper time
I normally don't hit but I'ma fuck this time
She ate a shroom and said now she in—

[Chorus: Reezy]
Tune with it, headin' to the Moon with it (Moon with it)
High vibrations, radiatin', I can't lose with it (let's go, I can't lose with it)
Got a [?] drippin' water, she come through with it (drip, drip)
I'm in tune with it (aye), I'm in tune with it (I'm in tune with it)
I'm in, I'm in tune with it, headin' to the moon with it (to the moon with it)
High vibrations, radiatin', I can't lose with it (I can't)
Got a [?] drippin' water, she come through with it (drip, drip)
I'm in tune with it (aye), I'm in tune with it (I'm in tune with it)

[Verse 3: Demrick]
I'm in tune with the vibe, we both water signs, I'ma dive inside, like a pool in your thighs
Different state of mind when the two align
Now it's you by my side, I left a couple on the line
I know a few that's surprised, but only a few appreciate the grind
Appreciate what it really takes to make a thang real, hard to step away from the field
Take time, marinate, build, old wounds and scars, they heal
Real feels always revealed, secrets stayin' safe and sealed
Water flowin', never stayin' still, mind, body, and soul fulfilled

[Verse 4: Oktane]
Look, smoke one, drive two, be about three, clap it on four
Met a nigga, felt the vibe, got inside, then she wanted more, yeah
Dress myself, impress myself, make the clothes, I don't need a store, yeah
Snakes mean grass, your vibe is too low, I'm at the top floor, listen
In tune meditation levels, all the homies levitate together
Have that, calm yourself down, one week, workin' in town
No past, the future right now, yeah, that's the focus
Plane level, yeah, that's the closest, way past the vultures
And now you know it, 'cause I'm in—

[Chorus: Reezy]
Tune with it, headin' to the Moon with it (Moon with it)
High vibrations, radiatin', I can't lose with it (let's go, I can't lose with it)
Got a [?] drippin' water, she come through with it (drip, drip)
I'm in tune with it (aye), I'm in tune with it (I'm in tune with it)
I'm in, I'm in tune with it, headin' to the Moon with it (to the Moon with it)
High vibrations, radiatin', I can't lose with it (I can't)
Got a [?] drippin' water, she come through with it (drip, drip)
I'm in tune with it (I'm in tune with it), I'm in tune with it (I'm in tune with it)
