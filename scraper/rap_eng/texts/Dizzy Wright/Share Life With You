[Verse 1]
Look, I need a partner not an enemy
Don't bring me down with all of that negative energy
If you a friend of me, show it
Dedicate effort, show me I'm yo man and tell me you want this forever
Tell your friends I'm the one
Go to sleep and dream about me
When you in the shower, enjoy and imagine a scene about me
Pray for me, make decisions with me
Don't talk behind my back and try to turn people against me
Make me feel like I'm a king, the dream Martin Luther had
The feeling Bobby had and Whitney used to have
For the first time, like your first rhyme,in first grade
Don't make me feel like the new kid on his first date, awkward
I'm an imposter to love, and it's crazy just to know this shit started with a hug
And now our souls touch and I'm glad as shit
Your beauty brings out my happiness, I'd share life with you

[Hook]
I don't think I'm falling in love
But I know I'm falling in like with you
I love the conversations that we have
In the future I hope that I can share life with you
I hope that I can share life with you
I hope that I can share life with you
I love the conversations that we have
In the future I hope that I can share life with you

[Verse 2]
I need an angel not a hurting chick
I need guidance, stability, encouragement
I need you to take my pain away with humor
Forget about the rumors, live life like bloopers
Baby you the one, I hope the feelings mutual
I know we not perfect so we got some getting used to
Just to stay useful, I'mma try to make it right
I'mma change what's a problem and perfect what you like
See that's the sacrifice I decided for us
So when they ask how we do it, we just say it's cause of trust
We got a bond, Barry Bonds couldn't break
I like it when you leaning in my arms through the day
Keepin' your body close to your man, your number one fan
The person who gon support you all the way to the end, me
It feels so right with you, I just wanna share my life with you
I hope you feel the same

[Hook]
I don't think I'm falling in love
But I know I'm falling in like with you
I love the conversations that we have
In the future I hope that I can share life with you
I hope that I can share life with you
I hope that I can share life with you
I love the conversations that we have
In the future I hope that I can share life with you
