[Hook: Devon Lee]
I know I've made mistakes, but I'm not alone
I know I've made mistakes, I'm not the only one
I know I've made mistakes, but I'm not alone
I know I've made mistakes, I'm not the only one

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Caught in these mixes, didn't know this existed
A running rebel, my daddy a Detroit Piston
Caught in between being a gangster and a Christian
Stash at his missus, but it didn’t stop the snitching
Incarcerated, a target raised in a cave
He [?] black, he ain’t forming to make mistakes
Who snoring on me, I’m waking niggas with rage
I’m realizing my anger issues gone land me behind the cage
Slow down brother, let’s utilize it
I see you tryna do it big, well I’m tryna supersize it
Leaving niggas in silence, pull up on you while you advertising
If it ain’t my shit I’m finna sabotage it, yeah
Sorry don’t mean shit to a nigga
No more, she only go for a pick for a picture
Ignore, only call when the bitch get bored
And I ain’t tryna make that trip no more
We all make mistakes

[Hook: Devon Lee]
I know I've made mistakes, but I'm not alone
I know I've made mistakes, I'm not the only one
I know I've made mistakes, but I'm not alone
I know I've made mistakes, I'm not the only one

[Verse 2: RA the Rugged Man]
Since I was born been caught between right and wrong
Devil got a grip on me like a python, live life under Christ’s arm
Life on, make mistakes, fight strong, recite this song
Shine a light to the blind eye till I die and my life’s gone
Need to learn to let go so the pain won’t last
Human beings make mistakes, don’t dwell on the past
Don’t be so quick to gossip and pop shit when you accomplished
Just a novice, now you a felony murder accomplice
Stuck in prison, drug addictions, bragging to every sucker that listens
Markets and liquor store robberies and other missions
I made many relationship mistakes that didn’t go well
Lying to my queen with groupie bitches in my hotel
Fucking my girl’s best friend, hoping that ho won’t tell
Sabotage my own career, making sure I don’t sell
Rough life, lost fights, won fights, drunk nights, bum fights
White House tryna take your gun rights, mistakes

[Hook: Devon Lee]
I know I've made mistakes, but I'm not alone
I know I've made mistakes, I'm not the only one
I know I've made mistakes, but I'm not alone
I know I've made mistakes, I'm not the only one

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
Nigga don’t lie to me, I don’t care what you’re trying to be
If you fuck with the dynasty, you get decapitated, tasting in a recliner seat
Pick the time and week, capiche?
Food for thought, you finna have a feast
Now I’m on my doowop shit
With a kangol, don’t act like I won’t flex on a bitch
Back and forth with the absence, happy to be average
Mama made mistakes to make it happen

[Verse 4: RA the Rugged Man]
Sanctity desecrate, mind state second rate
Blood money generate, regulate, spreading hate
Hip hop, I’m the head of state
Hop a dig up in the record crate
Never pay no DJ to make no record break
I’m an animal that tries to be a conman
No matter how bad my past mistakes was, they was part of God’s plan
And me and my cousin Donna wasn't speaking over petty shit
Then she passed away unexpected, yeah that was a heavy hit
Mistakes
