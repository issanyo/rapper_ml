(Intro)
Yiggity yo, nigga really came up
Came really far
I appreciate everybody
That have been rocking with ya boy
Im finna do some shit for yall
You know, some thoughtful shit... Yo Yo!

(Verse 1)
If he's immaculate, tell me would they praise him
Mama had no man, her up in this rap game raised him
Can't cave him, I told my grandma i could help him
But i can't save him
Shit, the damage is done
23, making my daughter believe that Santa gon' come
Even though daddy working hard, we just enhancing the fund
Keeping them spirits high, civilized
Learning the game 'til it's memorized
Wait, hol' up, yo yo
Brother man I ain't talkin' for nothin'
I've changed brother, i used to be lost in abundance
When you want it, you will work until it's haunting your past
Spend all your time with a bitch that could sit a cup on that ass
You want that corporation money, haa?
We absolutely happy with everything that's bringing you yo happiness
As an activist y'all can't tell a nigga how we have to live
But what you want to receive you have to give
I told em i'd be here for the longest
Took it back and owned it
Zoning off the weed but not complaining 'bout the moment
Free man spoken, written like a 1990's mad poet
And you didn't even notice
In order to live you gotta keep a check
Survival is not a choice it's just a deep respect
I plant the seed and flee the scene and let my team know
We the best! and he just feed the flesh
I ain't even sleeping yet, that's why I'm the people's threat
Vegas bound made a crown and then they put it on me
Now the hood is on me cause I ain't thuggin' with a hoodie on me
Nigga's want war and they ain't going goodie goodie on me
So in order to be in peace, i gotta keep a piece
23, with a daughter going on 3
I think like in 18 years who will she be
Since day 1 I've been official
But if I don't use my voice to benefit my baby girl then this ain't beneficial
Fixing my issues i see was working against me
Bring out my old soul, that inner Dizzy Gillespie
He was blowing on his trumpet like I be blowing on this sticky
Too bad i won't be here to see them miss me
I got a lot of love in my heart, I can't be into 'em both
You choose one, and use one, and try a different approach
Stick to the notes, like the bitch that's proud of trickin' the most
Who's seen hidden colors I'm just a brother that's been living with ghosts
You see I started from the bottom, mama never home
Moved into a shelter home, knew i'd never see a college
Fast money problems got me starving
Raised in Vegas, but a Michigan nigga when times get the hardest
I stick to the knowledge i grew up and received
If you ain't gotta purpose to breathe, then you gone hurt me and leave
A walking angel, I'm coming at you from every different angle
When I look in the mirror I see a different person than me
Aye who at war with himself
Hatin' on the man that desire a little more for himself
Of course, you ain't bored of yourself?
Yeah, you movin' forward but you forcin' yourself
And I ain't tryin' to be real, chill
The pain of living
I'd rather not make the same the same decisions than stick to my mary jane addiction
Now where my lighter at?
If you got a head, then I'm inside of that
No writers block, I like to rap nigga [x3]
