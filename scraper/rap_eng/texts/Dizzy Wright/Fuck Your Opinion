[Verse 1]
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Suffer through the weak but still in touch with what I see
Fuck it up on these beats
But you'd never notice I've been hiding what I'm holding to the potent that is tree
Me, myself and I
Might not meet your standards, but I swear to God I try
Use the Lord in vain to get my point across, why?
I hate it, but I do it, like it'll be aight
Got damn I need change, then I just smile
Why? Cause it ain't finna change nothing I'm around
Still gotta ride
Still gotta be down, load up and make it happen if shit ever gets wild
Surrounded by a crowd that you wouldn't call friends
But these the same niggas that help you become a man
Poor child, I'm your child, I'm hoppin' out this van
Police tried to get us, so we ran
Fuck going to jail, I got bills to pay
My everyday life make me feel this way
But can you blame me? Hang me up and frame me
Tried to keep smiling, but the smiles be shady
Being fake make me angry and change my flaws
Punished for the bad, rewarded for the good, man, we trained like dogs
Can't see it, it ain't even
No freedom when they ain't leavin'
Pray for us, we all need it

[Chorus]
Lately my praying getting stronger
But honestly they ain't never been a problem
I'm tryna find my connection with God
That's why I've been hiding behind this marijuana
Stressing, living, such a blessing if you listen
They wanna judge to my connection different so I made a decision
Made me feel weird cause I don't get it to the niggas and the bitches
And I just wanna say fuck your opinion
Nigga, fuck your opinion

[Verse 2]
I'm blinded by successful thoughts
Everytime I come out, they got they tongue out
Man, I swear that I'm dealing with a stressful loss
We ain't hung out since he got strung out
And still I stand
This weed take a real big effect on how chill I am
Still alive, but it killed my friend
I'm tryna show you my hurt, I'm not tryna show you how real I am
No one hear me, cause it's all talk
Selfmade, I ain't never finna fall off
We, actually talk, ya'll all thoughts
Who would have thought
That little nigga from the ballpark would make a change in the world
Fucked up, but it came with a girl
That helped me bring Xhai in this world
Damn, I ain't comfortable in my own skin
But then again, you gotta be brave in this world so my mind won
I ain't lyin', I ain't rhymin' for the shine, mama
Have faith, find God, don't find drama
Ah, here he go again
This shit is so easy to lose your way in the city of sin
Yeah, surrounded by hoes and pimps
Immune to it, a two-word is no and if
Jehova kid, but she gotta make a living
Bad decisions, good intentions
On a mission, nothing ever handed
So she already made plans to ask God for forgivness
Judging by the moment, but you blinded by the hidden
I've been smoking like a goddamn hippie
Damn, but shit at least I'm doing my best
I've been grinding since I moved to the west
I've been reading more, styles from either or
I am great, you can see it at my shows, you'd bee truly impressed
I do me the best
And nigga this is a lesson through the herb
Growing up I'm learning to be impeccable with my words
Stressing over nothing, but my heart keep me concerned
Thanking God for every blessing that I earned
Dizzy Wright, nigga

[Chorus]
Lately my praying getting stronger
But honestly they ain't never been a problem
I'm tryna find my connection with God
That's why I've been hiding behind this marijuana
Stressing, living, such a blessing if you listen
They wanna judge to my connection different so I made a decision
Made me feel weird cause I don't get it to the niggas and the bitches
And I just wanna say fuck your opinion
Nigga, fuck your opinion

[Outro]
And I ain't no muthafuckin' weed rapper, nigga
Expand your mind
Fuck your opinion
