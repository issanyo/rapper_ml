[Intro: Manny Scott]
The word is not simply a scribbled symbol or a spoken sound
The word is not like a roaring lion that no one really fears
No, the word has power
And it can be your most trusted friend or your most terrible foe
You see like a seed, the word gives life
Like a lamp, the word gives light
Like a mirror the word reflects
Like water, the word washes
Like fire, the word cleanses
Like a hammer, the word shatters
Like a sword, the word cuts
Oh but like medicine, the word heals
And like a counselor, the word comforts
You see the word is alive, and it is waiting
Waiting for you to summon it like a soldier
And send it forth into battle, so speak

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
They tell me I sound like a prophet, feeding my niggas with knowledge
Mistaken it's been too much faking, thorough nigga business we keeping it solid
I’m ready to (teach and learn), educating for this heaven on earth
Overcoming all my family doubts, the man of the house no man to observe
(Shit can get worse but we pulling through)
I’m illuminating that entire equation, creating
I know you can't see it right now but I’m teaching my niggas to be better communicators
They dumbing us down, one by one hunting us down
I try not to sound like a preacher
But if our daughters and sons are kings and queens they have to be prepped to be leaders
(Follow and order his steps, the man with the plan gets most the respect)
So I’m bowing down with my hands together forever praying for anyone losing they strength
(We in this together right?)
There’s reasons for you to believe it, inspired when found it in what I was reading
And now I feel like it's what I should be teaching, starting with the First Agreement

[Chrous: Nikkiya]
I’ll remain humble and my heart is always open
Cause I understand behind every great man is some situations
As I look into your eyes
I see the pain that I’ve caused, and so I apologize

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
To my single parents that's young, mama's not holding her tongue
It’s a shame but even through all of your pain I hope you teach your child how to love
I’m loving they feeling we doing it right for my niggas that's losing they sight
You cannot criticize anything that you do if you’re always a student to life
(A product of truth) Sad part if it’s hard to be yourself you’re a part of it too
(Now I’m breaking it down) so it’s understanding me philosophy comes with the proof
Success requires a push, straight forward is the only way to look
I heard if you wanna hide something from a nigga, the best way to do it is to put it in the books
So they making shit difficult, Imma talk about the principles in general as individuals
You balling, you made it, you happy and flexing, every rapper story sound identical
(You seeking a better life)
There’s reasons for you to believe it
I picked up a book and was reading and now I feel like it’s what I should be teaching
Starting with the First Agreement

[Hook: Nikkiya]
I’ll remain humble and my heart is always open
Cause I understand behind every great man, is some situations
As I look into your eyes
I see the pain that I’ve caused, and so I apologize
