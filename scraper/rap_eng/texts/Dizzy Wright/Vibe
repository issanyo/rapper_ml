[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
You got a vibe I ain't never seen, woah
Girl I'm tryna do the most with you
I can show you all the better things, woah
Girl I'm tryna do the most with you
You got a vibe I ain't never seen, woah
Girl I'm tryna do the most with you
I can show you all the better things, woah
Girl I'm tryna do the most with you

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Zoovie night, it's the zoovie night
Take you places you ain't banging on a flight
All across the globe
You got everything I like and everything I want
So bring that fine ass over here, come here with me queen
Rollin' up my weed while she takin' off her G-string
Don't make it complicated
I'm a king this ain't a random conversation, nooo
We the truth, fuck you mean?
Mountain view, enjoy the scene
You see the lights, turn up the Strip tonight
Go 'head live the dream, that's alright
And we up all night, that's 24/7
Sin City livin', tryna get to your heaven
And with your blessin' I'ma hit the win streak
You the trouble that I mean, girl get in

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
You got a vibe I ain't never seen, woah
Girl I'm tryna do the most with you
I can show you all the better things, woah
Girl I'm tryna do the most with you
You got a vibe I ain't never seen, woah
Girl I'm tryna do the most with you
I can show you all the better things, woah
Girl I'm tryna do the most with you

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
'67 Chevy when we ridin' down Rodeo
Might just do the most and park that shit in front Chanel
Matching rollie-rollie, yeah we went Ayo and Teo
Even went and copped you ice trays for the grill
Post mate meals, somewhere hidin' in the hills
Take you to Marie's, put the bust down on your nails
Hit her with the stroke, with the stroke
Every time 'til she tell me, "You the GOAT, you the GOAT"
Baby never disappear with the cloat
I done put you in the game, just remember who your coach
GG on the tote, she don't ever do the coach
OG in the bag, lil baby keep it raw
You know that you the baddest in this bitch, selfie savage with the pics
Just don't ask too many questions, it won't feel like it's a test
Now I hit you in the mornin', but that ain't gon' be for long

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
You got a vibe I ain't never seen, woah
Girl I'm tryna do the most with you
I can show you all the better things, woah
Girl I'm tryna do the most with you
You got a vibe I ain't never seen, woah
Girl I'm tryna do the most with you
I can show you all the better things, woah
Girl I'm tryna do the most with you
