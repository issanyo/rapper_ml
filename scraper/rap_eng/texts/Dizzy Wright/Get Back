[Intro]
Uh, What up

[Verse 1]
Guess who it is that’s trynna do it big
He blowin’ up that same nigga you grew up with
Uh, Bring the bass they don’t need the drum
She said “Uh Uh, who? Katrina son?” (Dizzy)… Yeah that’s the one
The one that’s getting stares and stops
The young nigga that’s gettin’ compared to Pac
Now that’s deep Uh
And I know they don’t want another Pac cause that’s too real for the motherfuckin’ streets
But I'mma beast for Christ
They done unleashed the Wright
Early 20’s and shit, im trynna teach weed life
It’s cool (It's cool)
If your ego won’t allow it fool, higher learnin’ bruh, I got some sour too
Aww, shit
Now they wanna kick it
Actin’ interested trynna get all in my business
But it’s funny cause I caught the fuck shit befo’ you did it
You done missed out now I’m about to make a killin’
So I say…

[Hook]
Get Back, Get up off me
We ain’t cool don’t try to act like you know me
We wasn’t homies then
But in the city of the sin, pretend is all around (x2)
Hey

[Verse 2]
Shit
Now they callin’ my phone houndin’ me
Uh, Supportin’ all bout oh you proud of me
Nigga please
I remember that shit you said when you was trynna get a verse, and I was trynna get ahead
See, I was focused on my bread and now I’m back, with an attitude
And I ain’t mad at you, I just don’t fuck with you
Used to be the cool guy
Popular to famous
Made it to this
Shit, hit me when you poppin’ up in Vegas
I done did my ground work
Developing my craft
Livin’ large, happiness got me snugglin’ with my cash
Ascent with the profit
You rappers need to stop it
Got a voice for no reason. What’s a song without a topic?
Dumb silent
I’m Done trying
Ya’ll should be done grindin’
Front stage, singin’ all of this music that’s young minded
Maturity alliance
Niggas that ain’t tryin’
Ain’t allowed in the crowd, for the smiles
So I say…

[Hook]
Get Back, Get up off me
We ain’t cool don’t try to act like you know me
We wasn’t homies then
But in the city of the sin, pretend is all around (x2)
Hey
