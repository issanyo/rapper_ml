(Welcome to my world, Dizzyland)

Shit, I got my mind on a million
I feel like if I die I'mma die as the realest
People say I'm tripping, but we sacrifice Pac
Sacrifice biggie, now they gotta deal wit Dizzy
I feel like if I'm riding, then my niggas ridin wit me
It's scary, but I refuse to choose to live in envy
That's why I need an Emmy, or a major blessing
Cause selling my soul is out the question
I wanna make a change
Shit, but shit is hard
So much on my chest and I'm just tryna get it off
We all have flaws, but we don't admit 'em all
If we did maybe the world would be better after all
Damn, this lifestyle's starting to bother me
Cause honestly I don't never have privacy
24 Hours I'm working on my prodigy and I ain't gon lie
I'm so proud of me nigga

(yeah) cause when you trying to make moves
People always gonna hate and tell you that you ain't doin it
Til you pursuing it, then they wanna ruin it
But I ain't got time for foolishness
Homie I'm on
Yeah I'm doin it (x3)
Homie I'm on
Yeah I'm doin it (x3)
Homie I'm on

(Yeah) See, if you feel me then I fuck with you
Problems with my fam so I got trust issues
And love with you? Nah boo, I don't think so
I have a dream like I'm rapping the Dr. King flow
This could've been my single, but it's too harsh for em
Pac's gone so I figured I would talk for him
To let the world know we need to help these children
The world's not ending, it just needs healing
But that's my own opinion, I'm tryna make a change
But similar swags make it hard to make a name
Damn, so they compare me to the next man
This shit is weird like jacking off with your left hand
See my best friend, my best man, my homie
Told me that shit would get better slowly
But yall niggas don't know me, so tell me why you judging
To get my point across I gotta speak it to the public, fuck it

[Hook]

Dear Lord please tell me what I'm here for
I feel like everytime I rap a nigga sin more
I know I'm positive, but everytime I get on my knees and pray
I find it hard to acknowledge him
Well that's the Devil doin, God is gon' help me through it
And the struggle is what's helping me spit out better music
This is the war movement, JC I got you boo
But trying not to sin is so impossible
So I'm not trying but I'm trying to live a better path
Help my mama and give her the things she never had
But it's not easy, but failure I won't fear
Cause if rapping is not for me I don't belong here
It's been a long year, I'm trying to get a grammy
And show my granny that this rap shit came in handy
But yall gon' try to knock me down when I'm not around so
I'm about to focus more on my shit

[Hook]
