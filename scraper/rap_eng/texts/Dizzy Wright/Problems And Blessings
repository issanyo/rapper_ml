[Hook]
You move away, you do your thing, just stay connected
Work hard and leave a good example when you exit

Handle your problems like you handle all your blessings x2

I'm on my journey but I don't know where I'm headed
Been through some shit that'll bring me down but I won't let it

Handle your problems like you handle all your blessings x2

[Verse 1]
We were scraping for pieces, motivational speeches
Told me take it or leave it
Learn what I learned, but at that time I just felt so defeated
Everyone was eating
My heart was racing and beating my demons keep trying to get even
Why you trying to find a reason?
Find someone else to step on
Putting in that work this is not a fight you should bet on
My head on straight
Trying to find your piece of mind at times could be a deadly trait
I never doubt myself is just something you should never say
Secure my spot with all these godly verses
You wasting money but in your mind I'm sure it's probably worth it
I'm working, who turn the gamers into gangsters?
I remember feeling danger, now I'm feeling more discouraged
Don't feel that way, I feel your pain, I know you're aggravated
You'll get your time, by then I hope your mind is activated
Overcome tasks, we grew up fast, that's just the saddest statement
One thing I wanna say, enjoy your younger days

[Hook]
You move away, you do your thing, just stay connected
Work hard and leave a good example when you exit

Handle your problems like you handle all your blessings x2

I'm on my journey but I don't know where I'm headed
Been through some shit that'll bring me down but I won't let it

Handle your problems like you handle all your blessings x2

[Verse 2]
Shout out to the fans that hit me with the message requests
Number one, I'm never focused on who's second to best
Number two, I move from Flint and been respected in the west
I was a freshmen top 10 but who selected the rest?
The fans chose me, that's why you gotta give it direct
Depended on your rapping, a big change will get them to melt
A lil help never hurt if you elevating yourself
That's what I try to tell myself before them cards get dealt
Lace my case, tuck my shirt in and then I tie up my belt
High of life while these other niggas high of wealth
Staying healthy with the health, I'm the one that they idolize
I went from window shopping to ?
Common interests bringing out interests and replies
Can't substitute me so she, shake her booty on live
Hard to truly define
They say it's hard to read me, she can't read between the lines
Just take your time when

[Hook]
You move away, you do your thing, just stay connected
Work hard and leave a good example when you exit

Handle your problems like you handle all your blessings x2

I'm on my journey but I don't know where I'm headed
Been through some shit that'll bring me down but I won't let it

Handle your problems like you handle all your blessings x2

[Verse 3]
They follow crazy trends, the game done changed again
Tell 'em I came to win
My motivation is to show my kids an amazing man
Hold on let me tape this in
Do what feels good but please don't make the same mistakes I did
Gotta be yourself cause you'll go crazy tryin' to think like them
Don't build bad habits, nah
I thank my coaches for the structure I got from basketball
Yeah, life gets tough I know
Can't build that empire if you can't make your hustle flow
You make that money fast and forget that that struggle's slow
Write down my humble goals
Then I exaggerate won't backpase ? well that means I'm getting close
All up to the most high, and you know why
Whatever you seem to believe
I just pray that they see my work the way that it's meant to be seen
Through TV screens, I'm still moving while these niggas stuck
In they routines, tell my haters I don't give a fuck
Livin' out my dreams
