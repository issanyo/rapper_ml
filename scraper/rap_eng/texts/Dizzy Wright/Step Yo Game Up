[Hook x2]
Hell nah, we ain't change up
Throwing dirt on my name huh
Niggas mad cause they ain't us and we came up
Niggas better step they game up
Fuck these haters, fuck these pussy niggas hating

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
I hate thirsty niggas more than thirsty bitches
Trying to run around like my bros
Y'all niggas don't know me, still a baby boy like Jody
Niggas addicted to bitches and Rollies
Lifted and gifted, with a nice little mistress
After work like Kobe
Put in work to put my foot in first
Doing this shit without trying hard
Talking game cause I'm good with words
Designer shit ain't always gonna hide your flaws
When the time will come, you can sign me off
I'm Kanye with no time to talk
In my position, what makes the difference
Is I can hang, and you will drop the ball
I'm slow ridin' without crossing over
Doing me in everything I do
I see y'all glorify lame niggas
But we could keep that between me and you
See my view, and I ain't seen nothing nice
Pump your breaks, you gon' be a front for life
On stage, I flush the fright and cuff the mic
Damn, this must be life, plug the lights
Solo dolo, they can't see me
First to do it, they can't be me
They struggle with trying to get out the city
Little Dizzy got busy and made the shit look easy
I ain't trying to be the only nigga on
But I'm only nigga on
Something came up when you stepped to the throne
My niggas requested the song

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Bitch I got one rule
That's don't fuck with team Argentina
Oranggina smoke, I don't need a toke
I just need a chameleon
I want bad more hoes and more millions
Til I'm in the bathrobe with four billions
Still I fuck ratchet hoes and civilians
I won't give no fucks, be cold chillin'
Boy I give a fuck about you, you a sucka nigga
Every bitch in here can get a buck up out you
Can I love your bitch and give a fuck about her
I fuckin doubt it, but she fuckin' bout it
Now I fucked around and fucked her down and I ain't give a fuck about it
Til the nigga really crossed your line
I crossed your bitch up off my list
It crossed your mind, you asked your bitch
You off the line, I parked my whip across the street
And popped the trunk, you crossed the line, you on the dime
I'm in the morning, catch your moms standing at the mourning
Looking sadder than an orphan crying, I'm on the corner
Nigga said he fucked my bitch and he hit, well of course you're lying
Of course you're trying, I mean
That don't really mean that you getting cream
All my niggas shooting like amphetamines
And my enemies, they don't really want it
They ain't on the same shit as me, me and Dizzy Wright
Gettin busy to the bitches like, you the shit nigga
Know I ride 'round with a group of ditch diggers
Where I'm from, you ain't ridin, you a bitch nigga
Our war, got you fucking top floor in the trunk of my whip nigga

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
I came from the gutter nigga, Eastside
No decent role models I could be like
My niggas slang all night by the streetlights
Me, I mold into a beast up on the mic, device
Adidas on my feet nigga, three stripes
That Cali make me feel like I can't breathe right
I think God put me on this earth to murder everything in sight
I can't believe the fucking nerves of these guys
Geeze, step your fucking game up
Death to them haters told me Jarren couldn't change up
Got them niggas puking on theyself
Thought they sick to they stomach
Cause they see my and nigga Dizzy came up
I never gave one shit, let alone two fucks
A nigga stay with 3 K's and I ain't talking Klu-Klux
I'm whippin in a new truck, chopped up, screwed up
My dick getting lubed up and chewed up by two sluts
Mr. Benton that's the name ho
I'm old school like shell toes and Kangols
You a bitch, you like anal and rainbows
I'm psychopathic bitch, I stay with a derranged flow
Put you in the back of a Durango
I got that, in case them niggas wanna tango
FV still moving motherfucker, it's the take over
Dizzy would you let these fucking lames know
