[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I got the juice get used to me
I used to spit the truth for free
I'm not the young duke I used to be
Make moves with me
Make moves with me
I got the juice get used to me
I used to spit the truth for free
I'm not the young duke I used to be
Make moves with me
Make moves with me

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Who's best to do it? No one but me
Light your weed up 'cause I'm the one to see
What you preach? Peace love and positivity
Limitless possibility my nigga are you feeling me?
Well I'm just getting started
I was a 21 Savage before I was getting collete
Young and reckless sleeping on my nigga carpet
Saving money doing what his mama taught him
My grandma proud of what I did
She inspired by the little things
So she'll be happy with this brand new wig
I'm getting cash money no Lil Wayne
Rest in peace to Darren that's my cousin name
So I can't just settle for the low budget fame
Brother man
I'm clutching the 4th quarter
Isaiah Thomas jersey I ain't fool ya
Aye little nigga

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I got the juice get used to me
I used to spit the truth for free
I'm not the young duke I used to be
Make moves with me
Make moves with me
I got the juice get used to me
I used to spit the truth for free
I'm not the young duke I used to be
Make moves with me
Make moves with me

[Verse 2: Demrick]
Oh yeah I'm clocking in this work time
Keep a bad bitch picking me up LAX curb side
Haters tryna judge my life with a birds eye view
To tell the truth I already knew they would turn sides
See some burning bridges I burn the competition
Thankful for the life I'm living this is God's decision
I got the tunnel vision hustle till I got attention
They talking tweet style I'm the rapper they got to mention
And life's about perspective it's just how you see it
Run out of season this game will give you the silent treatment
Bust a move it got so many flavors
My niggas smoking on the blunts following henney chasers
And time keep slipping can't get a grip on that
So get yours and get back
Fuck with that and see the blessings you receive
Best believe that my seed's freshly squeezed

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I got the juice get used to me
I used to spit the truth for free
I'm not the young duke I used to be
Make moves with me
Make moves with me
I got the juice get used to me
I used to spit the truth for free
I'm not the young duke I used to be
Make moves with me
Make moves with me
