[Verse 1]
Look, I put my soul in this shit
With this ink all on my skin
Think before you ink
I got this ink all on my hands, man
I'm growing up and I'm changing
Don't try to knock me out of my plans
You was bullshitin'
And my grindmode was giving it all I can
Boy I been down, reppin' Vegas
Had to show these niggas what's dedication
More than music, it's more than life
Than tryna figure out who gon' be the next to make it
Put in work and guarantee a show
Real nigga, you just a G.I. Joe
Believe I go see my bro from tryin' to get my real life looking like the T.I. Show
Man I swear to God I hate swearing to God
Tear the stage down I ain't sweating a job
I'm looking good and I'm swaggin' out
And I'm the next to blow and you the next to flop
Real nigga, I ain't scared of shit
Real niggas take care of shit
Wipe me down I like the crown
But when the mic is down this life you never get
I'm 21 and I'm drunk as fuck
Livin' life by myself (nigga)
Tatted up and I'm actin' up, no shirt better check out the belt (nigga)
Vegas raised, Vegas paid
Got up out that bitch to put it on
I'm the first to do it, show improvement
All I gotta do now is set it in stone
Hol' up (Hol' up) Hol' up did a nigga just swag like that? (He did)
Hat to the back, Gucci backpack, spittin' crack on you little niggas
Spittin' facts like that
Coming out the Veg with a rap like that? (He cold)
He cold nigga that's a fact
Trying to get me a platinum plaque
Kill this shit, A$AP the track

[Hook]
I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
I'm killing shit
So I'm chilling with a marijuana cloud and my bros
They talking shit but we talking goals
Gettin' money that's all I know
In this shit and I been the shit
And I did this shit all on my own
I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
I'm killing shit
So I'm chilling with a marijuana cloud and my bros
They talking shit but we talking goals
Gettin' money that's all I know
In this shit and I been the shit
And I did this shit all on my own

[Bridge]
Don't let me get in my zone (my zone)
Don't let me get in my zone (my zone)
I'm swaggin' out in my zone swear I'm swaggin' out in my zone
Boy, don't let me get in my zone (my zone)
Don't let me get in my zone (my zone)
I'm swaggin' out in my zone swear I'm swaggin' out in my zone

[Verse 2]
They done fucked up, let me out
Stressed me out, set me up
Mad as fuck, I got anger issues
And now you gon' feel 'em when you next to us
Vegas with me, shit evolved
Killin' niggas you don't wanna get involved
You barely good and my good is great
Compared to the team nigga we'll shit on y'all
Real nigga with swag (What?!)
How the fuck that sound nigga
All the fake niggas to the back
You ain't welcome round in my town nigga
Bogart and I'm so retarded
My social skills is over heartless
Niggas talking, bitches talking
Get to walking I don't hear no offers

[Hook]
I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
I'm killing shit
So I'm chilling with a marijuana cloud and my bros
They talking shit but we talking goals
Gettin' money that's all I know
In this shit and I been the shit
And I did this shit all on my own
I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
I'm killing shit
So I'm chilling with a marijuana cloud and my bros
They talking shit but we talking goals
Gettin' money that's all I know
In this shit and I been the shit
And I did this shit all on my own
