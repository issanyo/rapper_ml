[Chorus: Hi-Rez]
I went from no cloths to everything designer
Went from no hoes to Rihannas and Madonnas
Couple hundred Benz and a duffel Louis bag
I don't need the extra hand, you can put that on my mama
We ain't messing with you blings; preach
We ain't really playing games; preach
Nothing change but the change and the chains and the flame and the Range and the J's; preach

[Verse 1: Hi-Rez]
I remember passing out show flyers
Everybody just ripped them up
I was really thinking 'bout quitting
Spending hella hours trying to pick 'em up
Looking back, I wasted my time
Going at the boy over hit 'em up
I was just trying to get attention
By dissing dudes with the bigger buzz
Everyone around me telling lies
Have producers stealing my money
Realized it wasn't down to ride
Put my own team, started acting funny
For a long time the music wasn't moving
Mom suggested going back to school
I was in too deep to just give up now
I was stressing happy but i played it cool
All my friends went away to college
I was stuck at home so depressed too
No one was going to my shows and my videos were getting less views
All my music started getting darker
Fans said that they miss the old me
For the first time in life I was lost
I felt like even i didn't know me

[Bridge: Hi-Rez]
Throwing bands on the shawty like to drop it low
She want to leave the club with me, come on vamonos
If she ain't with it I ain't tripping, sorry adiós
Hoe run it up, around the corner like Domino's

[Chorus: Hi-Rez]
I went from no cloths to everything designer
Went from no hoes to Rihannas and Madonnas
Couple hundred Benz and a duffel Louis bag
I don't need the extra hand, you can put that on my mama
We ain't messing with you blings; preach
We ain't really playing games; preach
Nothing change but the change and the chains and the flame and the Range and the J's; preach

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Closet empty, eyes against me, feeling like nobody get me
This bottle with me, but still these niggas following me, that's the father in me
So i walk down the steps, okay what i'm 'bouta do next, go grind no flex
I hope that i was taking notes, while everyone was making jokes
I paid attention close, okay we gon' see who makes the most
Okay go ahead put up the post, nah they don't gotta be involved
I just work hard for this shit, and they just laughed at the kid
I feel like they gon' learn, maybe not now but my cock out like i'm Dre, money can't lock me up like akon in the day time, i be grinding
For them days we copped them cloths in front of the state lines we ain't have it
So shout out to all my bros and all my day ones
Now this girly smell that gonjo when i pull in
I'm just tryna' get my foot in, have my partner get the footage
Kick that real shit for the real ones, i just took them on a field trip
And we still going, still moving

[Chorus: Hi-Rez]
I went from no cloths to everything designer
Went from no hoes to Rihannas and Madonnas
Couple hundred Benz and a duffel Louis bag
I don't need the extra hand, you can put that on my mama
We ain't messing with you blings; preach
We ain't really playing games; preach
Nothing change but the change and the chains and the flame and the Range and the J's; preach

[Verse 2: Hi-Rez]
I don't say this to brag, I don't say this to boast
Finally making a killing doing something i love so let's make a toast
Me I've been moving in silence and getting shit done y'all be doing the most
I'm sorry to my own family and friends i used to be close with
Paying bills off of this rap shit, without no college degree
I'm doing this shit for my family, all of these kids gon' pay homage to me
I'm going off for my homies who passed and my people who copping a plea
I ain't going back to my old ways, it's the only option for me
All these girls just hated on me, never gave me the time of day
All these teachers told me to quit, said that i'd never find a way
Yeah i signed a couple bad record deals, now i'm independent 'till my dying day
Even though i was going through it, i knew that be a brighter day

[Bridge: Hi-Rez]
Throwing bands on the shawty like to drop it low
She want to leave the club with me, come on vamonos
If she ain't with it I ain't tripping, sorry adiós
Hoe run it up, around the corner like Domino's

[Chorus: Hi-Rez]
I went from no cloths to everything designer
Went from no hoes to Rihannas and Madonnas
Couple hundred Benz and a duffel Louis bag
I don't need the extra hand, you can put that on my mama
We ain't messing with you blings ; Preach
We ain't really playing games ; Preach
Nothing change but the change and the chains and the flame and the rain and the jays ; Preach
