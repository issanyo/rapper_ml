[Verse 1]
Sometimes I ask myself, is it really worth all that it comes with?
My main bitch overlooked my needs
Cause she think my fans come with some kinda comfort
We argue a lot, but now I feel I'm wasting my time
Can see my flaws, but can't see when I'm trying
I don't ask for shit, but you ain't feeling me
Future holds limitless possibilities
So if you stop believing
There's not a reason for you not receiving
Cause there's not a goal that I'm not achieving
I just need time, a little kush
With a little push
I know I ain't right, but I need mine
Think and grow rich, fix your face
The struggle is poetic It's giving birth to go out and be a great
In many ways, more than music, more like life changing
Surrounded by the Angels and the Satan's and it got me feeling

[Hook]
Frustrated just a lil bit
Gettin frustrated by the lil shit
I walk around like everything okay
But I don't know how much more I can take
Lord I'm 'bout to explode
Got me dealing with my high's and low's
Trying to stay high, but I'm surrounded with low's
Where do I go?
When I can't do my best
I'm frustrated on the road to success
I need answers

[Verse 2]
I wanna see the dollars circulate
Bout to elevate
Having visions of a victory
I'm 21 with the voice of the dead, you mofuckas about to witness history
So then I wake up with my mind on a mission
My grind now it's time for me to be more realistic
It never stops
She trippin, I ain't trippin
As soon as I got my vision I was connecting the dots
Big Will probably trippin' right now cause his lesson was got
This is the truth behind the message from pac
They ain't feeling me though
Niggas blinded by the industry flow
Categorize me as soon as I entered the door
It's all assumptions
And assumptions is basically nothing
Cause if you think about it it's all in your head
I been stressin a lot
Rapping trying to send my message to god
Got on my knee's and this is all that I said
This is all that I said..

[Hook]
