(Intro)
Stoney ...
Roll up some weed
Po' up some Henny
Tryna make a dollar while living off a penny
... yea!

(Verse : 1k Watts)
I'm just tryna see my homies smile
And roll a couple up
It kind of took awhile, but we finally growing up
Now we travel state to state
Cause we hate to wait on cake and paper plates
Yes lawd, it's been amazing grace
Thank God I had him on my side
Could have been a homicide
Fiening for some change to be made like Obama tried
Always on the ganja fried, never let the drama slide
Do it for my momma and the commas, so personified
I'm down to ride!
And I put it down for my peoples
21 years old, the boy so lethal with a voice so peaceful
I be chiefin' diesel in the Rolls Royce beatle
When the record scratch the needle, - Goddamn!
Do you really fuck with me?
I got my brothers and my cousins in my company
The life of luxury, the nicest cutlery
Tonight we gon' Toast to the Hustlery!

(Chorus: 1k Watts)
Roll up some weed
Po' up some Henny
Tryna make a dollar when you living off a penny
What's it like to be a king when your ego is deadly?
Roll up the Og, keep it super friendly
Toast to the hustlers, clientele and customers
Tryna make a living off of flippin
Hope they fuck with us, roll a blunt with us
I'm just tryna laugh, take a dab, count this cash
Til' the motherfuckin sun come up!

(Verse 2 : Dizzy Wright)
Yo!
I hit the streets like I'm the leader of the street team
I put words in the universe like I see things
If you want me to throw up this cash
Take off your G String!
I move like Lebron with only 3 rings
Maybe I, can't always be this crazy fly
So for now I'm stuntin' like it's 1985
Retro status, we don't move for reactions
Heal the world with these natural habits
You feel these girls but we can't feel your passion
There's a problem in that, you all plastic
Like a bitch with booty injections
You ain't lasting!
They don't hear me though
You would probably gossip bout me on the Wendy show
Then hit Wendy's fast food for GMO's
My shit really go, to say the least
You ain't gotta feel the flow
Atleast I'm making motherfuckers think
But Imma ...

(Chorus: 1k Watts)
Roll up some weed
Po' up some Henny
Tryna make a dollar when you living off a penny
What's it like to be a king when your ego is deadly?
Roll up the Og, keep it super friendly
Toast to the Hustlers, clientele and customers
Tryna make a living off of flippin
Hope they fuck with us, roll a blunt with us
I'm just tryna laugh, take a dab, count this cash
Til the motherfuckin sun come up!

(Verse 3 : 1k Watts)
I wanna rock J's in the mud
And act like I don't give a fuck
I'm really tryna get it
Tryna really stack my figures up
If you're tryna see me bitch, you need to cop a ticket stub
Roll a couple up, now you chiefin' with the spliffers club
You high as fuck!
I can see it in your actions
I work to hard for instagram captions
Gimme my advancement, tryna make expansions
Money, music, fashion, - Boy I do it with a passion
Ballin' on the competition
Hotbox in the Honda Civic
Everyday I'm flippin' really tryna get it
Tryna double up my digits
I be spinning rims, motherfuckers spinning fidgets
I be burning spliffs, all you bitches burning bridges
Why you acting timid?
Wasn't you a critic before I switched the image?
Your persona is a gimmick
I be pushing limits
Really bout my business when I'm rolling up my spinach

(Chorus : 1k Watts)
Roll up some weed
Po' up some Henny
Tryna make a dollar when you living off a penny
What's it like to be a king when your ego is deadly?
Roll up the Og, keep it super friendly
Toast to the Hustlers, clientele and customers
Tryna make a living off of flippin
Hope they fuck with us, roll a blunt with us
I'm just tryna laugh, take a dab, count this cash
Til the motherfuckin sun come up!

(Outro)

... yeah!
Hey ... Hey
Roll up some weed
Po' up some Henny
Tryna make a dollar while living off a penny
Yea...
Stoney motherfucker
A Toast to the Hustlers!
