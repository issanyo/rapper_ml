[Hook: Dizzy Wright & Chelle]
Calling my phone in desperate need
What if I didn't have it?
Even though you know my bills ain't free
What if I didn't have it?
When I hit 'em with the
I ain't got it right now you got to find a way to make it happen
You gon' turn your back on me grab a knife and get to stabbing
Calling my phone in desperate need
What if I didn't have it?
Even though you know my bills ain't free
What if I didn't have it?
When I hit 'em with the
I ain't got it right now you got to find a way to make it happen
You gon' turn your back on me grab a knife and get to stabbing

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Pulling out the knife on a nigga I don't even get it
Life is a journey we just living in it
We dependent got to go and reach the limits
Keep attending and no one complaining na
Everyday's another money situation
Look I be irritated I just play it off
I realize I got real fans but I feel that real love when my lady call
I don't really need much but a great laugh
'Cause there's a lot of shit that we ain't have
I hope you ain't forgot
When you on your grind and your working with a little
You make it look like a lot
We struggle for this way before the weed socks and drawals
Riding dirty praying I don't get the cops involved
You know DUI checks with the cops and dogs
But shit somebody had to make the mission
Car got some fixing day cares expensive
The baby keep growing not to mention
I got to keep food inside the kitchen
And I want to I'm optimistic
But I can't whats the consequences
For me being real with you
So when the nut shell
From the outside everything is looking upscale
I'm working to prevent from going down hill
I hope what I'm saying just don't sound real

[Verse 2: Chelle]
And now now you tell me I can't see my baby
Calling for diapers and classes that's crazy
And no no I am not a baby daddy
But no visitation for me like I'm happy
You so entitled but tell me what did you work for?
You ask for money and your reason is that I have more
And then enough to give it you
But I'm staying over 'cause I want to
You got to pay the cost to be the boss
Now tell me what you gon' do
