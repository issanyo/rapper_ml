[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Turnt up, walking through the door
I heard she pop that pussy on the low
We got weed, we got liquor, we got hoes
So come into my room after the show
I need a hotel stripper
Hotel stripper
Hotel stripper
Hotel stripper
See it's that night, that Dizzy Wright become a cold ass nigga
She pop pussy, and pop ass, that's my hotel stripper

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Finna put it down on the mic, only in town for the night
Spotted in the crowd, she slipped her tits out
And I can already tell what little mama's about
I told my nigga Gritty
Get me a "Go-Getty"
Mama so pretty I want her to roll with me
She ain't gotta fuck, but she gotta show titties
I ain't tripping nigga, this your city
(Like, Like, Like)
What the fuck we gon' do today?
You Stevie J, I'm Juicy J
We turnt up, and your facial expressions resemble coming up with the coochie face
We all out, ball out
Two bad bitches trynna do me bad
One on my lap, one on my back
Got my ass in a booby trap (Turn Up)
Tell me I ain't acting a fool
Sign a couple boobs than I'm back to the room
Back to the back finna put the mac on the crew
Where the bad bitches that was in the back by the booth? What it do?
I've been watching yall
Talk for a while just to top it off
Mama dance? No mam, than she not involved
So you know we finna pop this off
(Let me let y'all alone)
She Miss independent
Bentley bitches, and Mr. Benton
Throwing money like this shit's inexpensive
Raise your hand if you've been a victim (Goddamnit)
She dropping, and popping that pussy, and bouncing that ass, than she feeling the cock
(What's the rules?)
No niggas in my room
(What else?)
Unless them niggas in my squad

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Turnt up, walking through the door
I heard she pop that pussy on the low
We got weed, we got liquor, we got hoes
So come into my room after the show
I need a hotel stripper
Hotel stripper
Hotel stripper
Hotel stripper
See it's that night, that Dizzy Wright become a cold ass nigga
She pop pussy, and pop ass, that's my hotel stripper

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Hotel stripper, dont tell yo' nigga
You in here girl, I need pussy on deliver
(Yeah)
Room 111 come kick it with a killer
Got weed, got shh, got pills, got liquor
They say girls just wanna have fun (fun)
Stunting like a pimp, talk the panties off a nun
She can deep throat the whole barrel of a gun
Look at all that ass bet she got it from her mom
Throwing all that cash, look at all those ones
Really, damn look at all those ones
Spending all my money, goddamnit im drunk
Wake up in the morning, what the hell have I done
(NOOO!)
Wake up in the morning, who the hell are you hun?
Heard she pop that pussy for a fucking coupon
Bitch I'm bout my bread, Grey Poupon
Might fuck a fat bitch that weigh 2 tons
Made that pussy pop for some Marilyn Manson
Pull a handgun, hold that pussy for ransom
Made that pussy, Mmm bop, like them boys from Hansen
2013 I'mma buy you a mansion
Girl back it up now drop it to the floor
Make that ass clap, till that ass gets sore
Dizzy Wright say he looking for a hotel stripper
But Mr. Benton, baby need a hotel ho

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Turnt up, walking through the door
I heard she pop that pussy on the low
