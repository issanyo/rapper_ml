[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
You got to live for something
Center of attention but you big for nothing
That's 'cause I ain't always get the meals I wanted
I praise to seen you take it for granted
That's my pet peeve
You got to live for something
Center of attention but you big for nothing
That's probably 'cause you grew up in the hills or something
I praise to seen you take it for granted
That's my pet peeve

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
You know what it's like not telling
4 deep got pulled over and treated like felons
Handcuff in the sun I'm just going with the methods
My skin got melons I won't hesitate to tell them
The whole world inspire while we treated like peasants
I get it you niggas want to be
Everything that we want to be with the leverage
You take it from us but try to keep that out the piece of the segment
But we should probably squash that and focus on the present
'Cause we don't want the minds to get infected
By another misconception
Then you respect someone that barely feel accepted
But you probably misunderstanding the message
My DNA good they didn't have to flex they badges
All they see is tattoos like I don't pay taxes
We ain't ever trip over colors unless they flashing
In my hood looking for matches
Here we go again

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
You got to live for something
Center of attention but you big for nothing
That's 'cause I ain't always get the meals I wanted
I praise to seen you take it for granted
That's my pet peeve
You got to live for something
Center of attention but you big for nothing
That's probably 'cause you grew up in the hills or something
I praise to seen you take it for granted
That's my pet peeve

[Verse 2: Fatz]
My anger rise and my chest ease
I feel like some type of chess piece
They out maneuvering me
The back of they black and white is like an Uber to me
I'm walking through the ruins thinking how it's ruining me
Crushing a lemon with my lyrics and how true they can be
Yeah
I been in and out of revolving door
Recidivism the symbolism of fallen shore
The prison system reminding me of a college dorm
My college buddies they all done studied The Art of War
The 48 Laws of Power and the 4 Agreements
The universal law so we know the secret
Might just be stuck behind walls but you stuck sleeping
Time to wake that ass up you did enough dreaming
You got to live for something
Pick up a book, learn a trade, hit the gym or something
Foreal

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
You got to live for something
Center of attention but you big for nothing
That's 'cause I ain't always get the meals I wanted
I praise to seen you take it for granted
That's my pet peeve
You got to live for something
Center of attention but you big for nothing
That's probably 'cause you grew up in the hills or something
I praise to seen you take it for granted
That's my pet peeve

It's a lot of suckers out their man
Keep some real niggas around you
Talk to them

[Verse 3: Sedrew Price]
You can be blood related we ain't family if you don't believe
They out of hand keep in touch and say my dreams out of reach
Pet peeve I can't trust nobody but me
To get to the rack they gon' cross you over Kyrie
Got me cold as my Rollie I wear my heart on my sleeve
My skin can make me a victim shot by police
If they the criminals how my mug shot on TV
Look in a racist face why you want my mama to grieve
Tryna make me a hash tag closest I be
Is pounds on me and I'm plugged on a hash tag
No trash they have to pick up that's Glad bag
Dizzy OG make you talk your shit like dad swag
Pet peeve 2 let's see hm
Niggas would ride the wave like whatever they see, do
No Baylor, but the sea green BU
Got bitches giving super dome on Drew Breeze through

[Outro: Dizzy Wright]
Keep your weed lit
Keep your mind right
When the time right
We gon' figure it out
Yeah
We blessed over here man
Grateful for the little things
Like this crazy ass beat this nigga Reezy made for us
Sock it to me
I just told that nigga Peanut man
I ain't taking no mother fucking L's nigga no more nigga
It's gon' be a hard time nigga to get passed me nigga
I'm a tell you that right now nigga
You gon' have to come with your A game
