[Verse 1: D-Maine]

How I got here I will prolly' never know
But let the records show, that I came and gained the glow
Used to be like a gnome now I'm giant that's how fast I've grown
Paranoid thoughts of success and failure
Mixed with balancing work and pleasure
Then I look around, see the world burning down
We call for help nobody hears a sound, nobody hears a sound
So why should I trust these politicians
When they're all for the same mission
The oppression, Hidden secrets by the gov'ment
Won't trust em till they tell me something, tell me something
But this falls on deaf ears
Cause this what they don't want you to hear
The truth, gets covered and tucked like an infant
Describe the truth please what is it

Something that will never be known
I'm tryna listen up like a stethoscope
And until then my minds sky bound like a rocket
And if I fall call me comet, I'm gone


[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]

I'm on my older shit, this so appropriate
My lower days when I was down got me on some focused shit
Smoking shit, you fucking with me then you know this shit
Always open with the public low key on some Oprah shit
I AIN'T NEVER HOLDING BACK
My shoulder lean was clean
Before niggas was doing they NOLA claps and they fitted hats
That nigga supposed to rap
You hear how he be twisting words
Struggles got me through some twists and turns
You niggas finna learn, live and learn
Getting what you earned when you can spit it firm
The silent real
Killing beats if I can't then my license will
I ain't no nigga to steal another nigga style
Accept it but expect it to call these fuck niggas out
So life is what you make it... How
You do what you can stand as a man and make enough money to make it out
Just against the odds
We tryna be the bigger squad
Niggas living large, but this is a job (feel me)
