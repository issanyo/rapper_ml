[Intro]
We're back up in this thing, this State of Mind 2 thing
You know, little Ziggy changed everything
Zay done changed everything
But the vibes is still the same
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Proceed to reminisce
Think about my early goals (my goals)
This journey's been legit (legit)
Look at how I touch these souls (uh-huh)
Look at how I always handle myself
This don't come lucky, no (oh, no)
Sensitive about my shit
Soul food for the country folks
I was in this funky boat
They like "God damn it, he happy"
Spreading that world peace while they throwing their monkey wrenches at me
No love lost, no monthly distractions we come 'cross
Wasn't waiting for nothing to jump off
But I took that leap though
We come from zero, nothing, nathan, nada so God is my hero (she is)
The black sheep of my family, but even family can have the biggest egos (they can)
Watch our youngsters, I see you
From Flint to Vegas on my P's and Q's, as I keep meeting people
Yeah, I'm blessed and peaceful
Be humble, K. Dot style (that's right)
You wait too long and next thing you know life starts to wear you down
I believe that prayer counts
So, count your blessings, partner
My voice symbolic
Ask my roster, I always been silent
Before I'm forgotten, I just...

[Hook]
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something, something, partner
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something
You ain't the only one, you ain't
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something
Better yet, when your lifestyle change
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something, something, partner

[Verse 2]
Let me make this crystal clear
I'm coming strictly fitted (that's right)
Like, fuck them dress codes, y'all could miss me with it
I do my thing and them ladies fall down for them hippie spirits
I hop on stage and do my 60 minutes
Pushing that independence
Good weed is all I need
That TGA2 shit gon' get y'all where y'all need to be (y'all need to be)
I see exactly where I fucked around with make believe
Never take it hard, I just find different ways to take the lead (take off)
Doing bad business is a sunken place for me (I know it is)
Never hypnotized, unless it's life after death and that's a Biggie album (talk to 'em)
One time, for all of the greats
Sometimes I can't imagine how y'all lived without the space
And I'm not talking about the bigger houses
Sometimes it scares me that the bigger you get, you lock away
But I got a lot to say, so they gon' always have a Dizzy album
They gon' remember that I was a man of my word
It's not what you gained or you earned
It's about what you came and you learned
Telling the little homies like...

[Hook]
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something, something, partner
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something
You ain't the only one, you ain't
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something
Better yet, when your lifestyle change
Want to remind you that we all going through a little something, something, something, partner

[Verse 3]
Yo, yo, I hope you see me God
You taught me that holding the throne won't be no easy job
They throwing their sticks and stones, but still I remain so peacefully calm (uhh)
Dealing with these creepy times (uh-huh)
They sleepy, I get noisy
No, nigga, you can't avoid me
I'll be there shortly
Flying under the radar, right around the corner
From another brother's story, wishing you glory (I see you)
I see y'all shining though
Like diamonds on these new age rappers that's been trying to flow (that's been trying to flow)
Y'all like my little brothers that looked up and hit the lottery
And that's not being logical (ha-ha)
I been connecting the dots like dominos
Got to count it up yourself, yo, or you could be held accountable
This ain't a history lesson, y'all, more like victory down the road, so (victory down the road)
Keep it real, never fake
Who cares, as long as they can relate
It's too many people in this world to go one way
The human race is mixed up like liquor (let 'em know)
Thinking about it when I wake up trying to get 'em all with us
I know that me and all the homies, man..
