[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I'm not him, I'm not last, I'm not first
No wearing your mask in class, it won't work
In this cold ass shelter, home with long shirts
Tryna find a path to find but blind by my own dirt
I'm down to earth but let's work, I don't like to kick it
I encourage you to take in all this game that you were given
We sellin' tickets but where the difference? Typical visions
If you ain't watch the growth then watch how the fuck you portray the vision
I'm a boss because of my thoughts behind decisions
Sittin' on a cloud watching how y'all livin' foul with it
No way, Jos√©, bars for days, okay
Well show me somethin' I ain't heard cause all these niggas lie to earn
Reunited like Dizzy, you give me life
Flow in pocket, keep it rocking, you the legendary type
My motivation, I'm proud to show the respect
Just don't ever settle for less and cut the devil a cheque

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
I said fresh off the tour, back to work it's some more
It's Roland, rollin' in the doors, evenin' all the scores
He's even meeting applause from opening the jaws of them all
To evolving and solving is falls
They want me to stall, I manifest quick though
Can't stop me simple, my body's a temple
So if you ain't a thick nympho with curvy hip bones
Then you can kick stones, get gone, I'm in the zone
Gettin' close to the throne, my lines and my poems
I decided to show 'em and they like how it's goin'
I invited them home and enlighten the dome
Peace, & others gon'
But it's whatever
I know I spit it clever and I spit it for the better
Not the Glocks or the berettas
I'm tryna get us just to open our minds and to see
We all got potential, we just need to believe and achieve
Then we can be... anything

[Verse 3: Add-2]
And I chose to be a leader of the new school
So when I bust a rhyme my competition's where's Waldo
Them niggas is hard to find
Rappers musta lost they mind like Alzheimer's
Nigga I'm Frank Thomas, nigga you Carl Thomas
Kickin' out the kings outta they thrones
And I tell 'em "bow to Your Highness"
Make one dash like minus, feelin' is so ironic
Somebody call up a line us, I'm odd, we ain't even
Alarm clock flow, you rappers sound like you sleeping
Lord knows that I only wanna sell out shows
But the devil only hope is that I sell my soul
Nothing less than the best, if you test it you gettin' stepped on
Change a nigga quicker than Steve turnin' to Stefan, ooh!
My family matters the most
I turn these rappers into cats but me I'm turnin' to ghost
They a champagne glass, they just somethin' to toast
My verses like a car salesman, I be givin' them quotes
Get it jumping jack rabbits, I'm back in this backpacker
I'll smack 'em pack! Pack! Pack!
This verse is like black magic
