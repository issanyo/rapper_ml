Verse 1 (The Real BS)
For the first time in my life I seem to be at a loss for words
I sit around wondering Why is this life such a fucking curse
I just don't see any way that this life could get any worse
I'm gonna go crazy if I see one more person ride of in a hearse
I sit there at their funeral wondering where has all the time gone
All of my friends may have left deep down they're never gone
But I can't afford to lose anymore, so now I'm living Solo dolo
Don't try to find me, you'll never beat me at Marco Polo
I wish I would just die. Go extinct like I'm a dodo
My thoughts keep going back and forth. My brain is like a fucking  yoyo
I lose more than I gain but maybe that's how its  supposed to be
I keep having to let go of all the people that are close to me
So I sit here making songs gotta get my head back in line
What the fuck am I doing, how am I supposed to take the time
When time is too short, something that I can't waste
Nothing lasts forever and this is only a little taste

Chorus (Dizzy Wright)
Money plus the pussy plus the pain
Equals pleasure but the pleasure equals change
And when I tell a nigga that I'm growin that don't mean that I'm no lame
I just figured how to operate the game, can't trust em so I be ridin
Solo dolo, solo dolo, solo dolo
I can't trust em so I'm ridin
Solo dolo, solo dolo, solo dolo

Verse 2 (The Real BS)
What would you do if I coulddn't handle the pain
What would you do if I couldn't handle the fame
What would you do if I died today
Would you make sure I joined the list of greats
Or would my name just lost in the winds
People will say that I never went all in
Here I am trying to build on small wins
But all these haters be tryin to stall this
As the pain starts to get clearer, and the end draws nearer
I realized I need to work and focus on the man in the mirror
Where has the time went, where has the life gone
Time poorly spent, time I used to vent
Times I was upset, times I had tourettes
Times you were there for me, you ain't failed me yet
You're shit is whack but maybe so is mine, I'll never know if I don't put it out
But for now I'm sitting down till I make sure I'm following the good route
I got so many thoughts, I just don't know which ones to use
Don't you push me, I'll explode if you light the fuse
I'll do it by myself. Nothing else will hold me back
Solo Dolo till my death, killin this shit on every track
I hope that all y'all feel me, I just want a good message to be heard
We live and we lose and I realized that I still have a lot to learn
But we can't live without growing, so here I am growing up
I'm still soul searching, but I'm never giving up
I refuse to lose, grind hard till the dying day
With or without help, I'll never run out of words to say

Chorus (Dizzy Wright)
Money plus the pussy plus the pain
Equals pleasure but the pleasure equals change
And when I tell a nigga that I'm growin that don't mean that I'm no lame
I just figured how to operate the game, can't trust em so I be ridin
Solo dolo, solo dolo, solo dolo
I can't trust em so I'm ridin
Solo dolo, solo dolo, solo dolo
