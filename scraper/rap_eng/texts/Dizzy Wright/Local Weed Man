[Intro]

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Everything ain't what it seem to be
But when I'm on the scenery, I gotta keep the greenery
I'm high as hell so I might as well
Sell this little eighth cause' I'm searchin' for some clientele
But I been scopin' this bitch
She like to get high, so we end up smokin' this shit
Know I'mma hit some shit
We got it crackin in the house, bust a nut
Now Iâ€™m finna pick up this package of the loud, wow
Probably movin' in your direction
I ain't a show off this handgun for protection
Lessons I learned, Be clear don't be guessing
Get guide and have to deal with the L in your section
We grow weed over here, nigga
Educated tattoo sleeves over here, nigga
Lookin for it cause I travel a lot
Pick it up at "Jack In The Box"
Nigga is you matchin' or not?

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I'm lookin for the local weed man
Can somebody please tell me where he stay
I ain't smoked all fuckin' day
I got 50 on a muhfuckin eight
And I be straight
I ain't tryna cause no drama
Im just happy that a nigga got paid
You ain't gotta say names
Coulda brought my own, couldn't get it on the plane
All a nigga sayin, is where the local weed man?

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Im just lookin for the good
No stress, see the purple or the kush
Bitch boys always lying bout' they weed
Pussy dry man that shit ain't even cured
Pass it baby, get out your clothes
Lets get high, girl I live in the smoke
I ain't fuckin' around, Turn it around
Get to touchin' the ground, and I'mma score
By touchin' it down
I'mma man of my word
Had the weed and I'mma handle the curves
I need the herb before puttin' in work
Then I finally land
Got little momma buying me grams
Telling myself its all part of the plan
Stay on my shit
Hit a joint, then I hit a chick
Hit the stage and she hit a lick
That's thug love
Kush talks in the middle of the night
Need a local weed man on site

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I'm lookin for the local weed man
Can somebody please tell me where he stay
I ain't smoked all fuckin' day
I got 50 on a muhfuckin eight
And I be straight
I ain't tryna cause no drama
Im just happy that a nigga got paid
You ain't gotta say names
Coulda brought my own, couldn't get it on the plane
All a nigga sayin, is where the local weed man?
