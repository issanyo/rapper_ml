[Hook: Irv Da Phenom]
I said I
I've been waitin' all damn day for you to come on over (Oooh)
Girl come roll this weed up with me, I'm gon' smoke you (Wow)
Come and gimme shotgun kisses, shotgun kisses, shotgun kisses to me, babe
Give some shotgun kisses, shotgun kisses, shotgun kisses to me, baby

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
It's funny cuz she celebate to irrelevant, uhh
But act sexual to my excellence, right
She pick me up and we live it up, fast liar hittin' other niggas with the extra shit, uhh
She rolled it up and I lit it up, I'm smilin' cuz I know I'm tryna get a nut
Feelings for me and they kinda mutual but I'm lost
Cuz the more we seem to talk the qualities become her faults
Truth be told, never tell the truth in the dark
Scandalous the secret tellers always mix the truth with the false
Pointin' the fingers when doin' the wrong caught up in the mix
We better when we not together cuz we was friends before this shit
But I just sit back and listen, spark it and get connected with a spirit
Noddin' my head and let her know that I hear her
I feel like, a friend indeed is a friend with weed, shotgun kisses as we sample tree
S.O.C. Baby!

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, yeah, come elevate with me, medicate with me
Get the ho hook like Bobby did Whitney, or Whitney did Bobby
Sobbady got me walkin' on the moon don't drop me (Aah!)
Meet me in the bathroom stall or the lobby, Molly in the body got it feeling so euphoric
Damn, you the baddest mo' fucker in the party (Yeah)
Nice to know ya, pleased to meet'cha, hi, I'm Jarren, wanna cheese some reefer?
Come to my planet, we can dance with creatures, talk to marshins and move through speakers
Word to the mo' fuckin son of a preacher, naw, ain't ballin' but we done brought bleachers
Maybe late night we can spend some leisure time together? Fuck you to a seizure (Aah!)
Shotgun kisses, blow my brains out, on the phone 'til the break of dawn
Then hang out, what set you claimin', in the bed we bank out, girl
You 'bout to make a nigga pull that ring out
Prince, I kind, watch the streets of Sing Lou, fuck them other hoes, girl I'm senile
She good off the top, like a nigga to freestyle, we can blow that California wax in the meanwhile
Then hit redial ring me back like a time machine, sticky green like a lima bean
And your listin' all kinda things, get her outta them designer jeans
You ain't gon' miss it, can't go one day without you misses
Put the Mossburg to my head, pull the mo' fuckin' trigger, 'bout to give a nigga shotgun kisses

[Hook]
I said I

[Verse 3: Irv da Phenom and Dizzy Wight]
[Irv Da Phenom]
My, ebony queen with eyes reminiscin' of Sandra oaks
Starin' into my soul and she gazin' me through the ganja smoke,
Chocolate lips, prevent burnt fingertips and roach clips
I wanna hit and she just gimme a kiss, sharin' the way she feel inside
She put her mouth close to mine, she exhalin' to free my mind
She the only thing that's on mind sometimes, it's like I'm stuck just thinkin' of all the ways
I could pleasure you, whenever you and I get finished blazed
[Dizzy Wright]
I told her, "Don't carry weight on your shoulders, your struggles
Define your grind, your livin' life forexposure, your dosure medical closure
You open hopin' Jahova, don't judge you, you know we love you, our bodies closer and closer
We finna settle down, makin' us smile
We ain't hella loud, steppin' on no toes if we ain't never round
Turnin' kickings into visits shotgun kisses and missions, reavealin'
How I'm hidin' behind my feelings I'm motherfuckin' victim!"
