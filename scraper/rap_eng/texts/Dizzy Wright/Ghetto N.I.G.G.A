[Intro]
Ghetto nigga, ghettos niggas
Ghetto nigga, ghettos niggas

[Hook]
Ghetto nigga getting my hoop on
Telling myself a shelter is better than a group home
Telling myself at least I'm lucky to have these shoes on
Fuck is you on, fuck is you on
Fuck is you on, fuck is you on
Ghetto nigga, ghetto nigga get it popping
Never ignorant, we getting goals accomplished
Ghetto nigga, ghetto nigga get it popping
I'm 2Pac-ing, we 2Pac-ing

[Verse 1]
Ayo I went from playing hide-and-seek
To making music videos and sending out the private link
I'm proud of me cause I clearly remember seeing the insecure
Confused with the challenges for my momma God was giving her
I feel like I can feel the devil start to interfere
The feeling got similar
When I got wiser there was something that I admire
Let me remind you
I was a ticking bomb without the time jumping over bridges at Jim Bridge living on Donna
Just to be honest I learned a lot from y'all
My darkest days was brightened just by chilling at the park with y'all
We ain't smoked no weed or drank no alcohol
We was just some youngins playing basketball
With a catalog of music talking about how life's unfair
Thought we had it all but I swear our house got hit twice this year
Hating school no value to much if we can't find advice in here
Now I'm in these streets feeling like this ain't for me
Maybe because I'm just a...

Fuck is you on, fuck is you on

Never ignorant, we getting goals accomplished
Ghetto nigga, ghetto nigga get it popping

[Verse 2]
Having conversations about the progress we made
I know when it comes to the real music that it ain't popping the same
But history changed the future, that's why you follow his name
Look no shame cause I'm in this club like it's a bottle exchange
Make some money and these hoes try to swallow your pain
Oh I know your type, you trying to tell me things I like
Twisting up these words to sound different like we think alike
She think she thinking like a man but really thinking like a dyke
Shots going around and you know the truth come out
Let's not be disrespectful cause every opinion's welcomed
I'm predicting one of my artists gonna come with something special
My mind get to racing, the shit we been cooking is greatness
I want it, I need it, I ain't stopping, I'm possibly crazy
I got what these people ain't heard since the golden ages
How you playing games if you're only simulating
You must be mentally deranged or lyrically ashamed of the shit you ain't saying, but I'm just a...
