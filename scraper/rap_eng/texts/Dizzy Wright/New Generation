[Bridge]
Independent, sold out shows, and I don't think that's changing!
My fans say they wanna see me turn it up, and I can't leave ya'll hangin'
Bout that life, who came to see me rock this crowd? Damn, I must be famous
Came so far and it feels so amazing, and now we dealing with a new generation

[Hook] x2
(It's turn up season, turn up-turn up season, turn up-turn up season)
And I don't think that's changing!
(Turn up-turn up season, turn up-turn up season)
And I don't think that's changing!
(Turn up-turn up season, turn up-turn up season)
Came so far and it feels so amazing, and now we dealing with a new generation

[Verse 1]
Niggas getting live in the back
Reppin' left side of the map, got Vegas niggas tryna do rap
Been around the whole world once and I'm back
And I'm plottin' on how to do laps (yup)
Drop this see how they react
Even though it's world peace until the whole world collapse
But now we dealing with a generation gap
No commercial, I'm a little too thorough for that
But it's turnt up season to the max, straight out the trap
Get it jumping for show, pay ten racks for a show
Reminiscent on the days when I used to come for the low
Came up, now I'm finna blow
Shit, my feelings the fuel to my rocket
I won a million before you know I got it
She got a man but she gonna drop it, she so out of pocket!
I'm on my grind and I'm tired, they blaze with us to get higher
These Vegas niggas on fire, now these promoters throw us on flights
Was it make them tell, if you step to a king
Man, you brave as hell, who gon' try it?
You niggas late as hell
My bitch booty look like K. Michelle, and I'm feeling this fire!
That these

[Bridge] + [Hook] x2

You niggas confused, and I noticed it
So I stay in my lane while I'm rolling it
If you saying you fuck with my older shit
Well now the world can't see who I been growing with
I done came so far, niggas can't even get over it
No way no one is ignoring it
So move it, my homies in foreign countries
Found the weed before we went exploring it
This talent is what I was born with
Took about twenty years before I was touring it
Oh, you like it? Cause it's the first time you done heard it
Just wait 'til you see me performing it
I'm so live on the stage cause I smoke and I rage
And I jump on the crowd like I'm Method Man
So I'm puffin and rapping my verse on they hands
So high I hope that I never land
See a lot of niggas that I'm better than
In my FV letterman, on a plane
Headed somewhere I ain't never been
Always on the move, I don't settle in
Coming for the mother fucking throne (Yiggity Yuhh)
In a crazy city known to let the devil in
Every time he knock knock knock, girls let him in
Gotta dumb it down to stay two steps ahead of them, call me competitive
But I still got what you was trying to be, a clone
Now I'm pulling up the-
