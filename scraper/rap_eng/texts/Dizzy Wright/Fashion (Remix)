[Intro]
Yeah yeah, I'm fresh as fuck if you ask me
I got the homies with me...

[Hook: Dizzy Wright x2]
Now nigga that,now nigga that
Now nigga that,now nigga that's fashion
[x3]
I'm fresh as fuck if you ask me
All gold and I'm flashy

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, Jeremy Scotts or these thirteen's (which one's?)
With the wings
But I'm fly like Jordan off of that first string (can't decide)
Call me fresh prince
With this flat-top,Imma take it back
Retros with that face to match
Take a risk when I lace the kicks
Cause' I walk on the crowd
Call it cloud surfing
I'm the man out here (I'm the man out here)
Shoe game clean and nigga my gear
Nigga nigga
You a fan out here (you a fan out here)
You're a fucking with a lame
Baby stand right here (yeah)
Give it up to a new nigga
Kid ill, he a true spitter
Shoes [?] Taylor bag with a nice round ass
Tryna see what Imma do with her (yeah yeah)
Let her get it, if she back in two
Button up with a snapping clue (that's right)
Young nigga with a chest full of tats
Get back 'fore I kick you with the Patrick
Can't stop and it won't stop
Yeah you rap but you won't pop
It's a long shot
Dirty nigga you have no style
Low key (keep) in the wrong spot
Let the beat drop
Dre beats for the beep-bop
Good weed, I'm on a tree clock
I don't see hate
Make way for the young boys
Gettin' rich,it's a good day
Good God, I'm
So fly I don't need help
We making moves,wear your seat belt
Shit finna get real
For the club
Because I'm getting hella love
And I'm just getting my feet wet

[Hook: x2]

[Verse 2: Tungatz D'LAW]
Now how many times do I have to say
Your sixteen's will only last fifteen
Cause you ain't a star,you just masturbate
We working to be legends,this ain't just a dream
I bet that all your features use you as a bait
Cause you are just a hook that make these fishes pay
Like pictures,you're frozen,just posing
Betta add some fuckin' motion cause we(argh!)
Movin' forward like a movie,Ooh wee!
Here for the fuckin' culture,homie
As much as we are for the booty's
Givin' nothing but the best to the groupies
Cause they hungry like vultures,they eat
Junk food cause it's faster than the classics
Just hold up,cause a master needs practice
But I'm done with the warm up now
I'm bout to go pro,I'm ready to blow
Imma fuckin' time bomb,betta move out the zone
Cause this ain't dynamite,you might die tonight
Im A to Mic,shit I said it right?
Life's ironic,an atomic bomb
Bringin' back to life real rap
Supposed to be inspiring but these cats
Mo' focused on the gold than rhymin'
(that's right)

[Hook: Tungatz D'LAW]
But nigga that,but nigga that
But nigga that's fashion
[x3]
I'm fresh as fuck if you ask me
No gold but I'm flashy

Now nigga this
Like nicotine
So addictive
Cause nigga this's passion
[x3]
Im real rap If you ask them
And it's real as fuck cause I passed them
