[Verse 1]
Poverty got me stealing shit and running from the boys
Mama working for a temp agency, man any day she could be unemployed
It's a war zone out here
My family can't afford no health care
Got daddy issues at home, so I'm damn sure I ain't finding no help there
So I'm in the streets, Satan like to save his place for me
But everyday we're waking up and pray the police don't do us like Freddie Grey
I heard there's niggas dying everyday
I don't think they got the homies losing sleep
My community lacking unity
Who gonna help us with these opportunities?
Look, barely even learned loyalty
Cause the streets will eat you up and spit you out
Getting older, got to help with bill or mama probably finally kick me out
Brody stay in school
Don't be selling weed before them school dogs come sniff you out
Then he hit a lick and felt bad about it
Like the Devil grabbed it and ripped it out (ripped it out)

[Hook]
Tell them this the shit that we deal with
But I can't deal with it no more
Trying to get ahead
Since he heard her give birth and raise the dead
I mean damn
This the shit that we deal with
But I can't deal with it no more (no more)
Life's getting tough, I don't know (don't know)
Don't lose control of your soul
Tell them this the shit that we deal with
Tell them this the shit that we deal with
Tell them this the shit that we deal with
Tell them this the shit that we deal with

[Verse 2]
Something smart could save somebody's life
When you finish starting, what you waiting for?
If you're losing focus, you should play this more
Always winning more, Michael Jackson '84
Gotta keep it thriller, don't it sound familiar?
Have a 40 with your niggas
And look around
Cause in a couple years everybody won't be in the picture
Why you rolling up winners?
I'm losing my mind
Cause a woman of the year was Caitlyn Jenner
That's disrespectful, I'm offended
A man is a man, even after the image
Wait, you can't tell me this world ain't confusing!
Drugs got niggas dealing with it, do you niggas even pay attention?
What are you rap niggas doing?
That ain't cool
The struggle remind me of the starving days
Most people fail by only focusing on the starting phase
Too bad they don't teach us that in school
Cash advances, no overdraw fees to damage with the funding
You could start a business, but can you run it?
Don't waste your life chasing money

[Hook]
Tell them this the shit that we deal with
But I can't deal with it no more
Trying to get ahead
Since he heard her give birth and raise the dead
I mean them
This the shit that we deal with
But I can't deal with it no more (no more)
Life's getting tough, I don't know (don't know)
Don't lose control of your soul
Tell them this the shit that we deal with
Tell them this the shit that we deal with
Tell them this the shit that we deal with
Tell them this the shit that we deal with
