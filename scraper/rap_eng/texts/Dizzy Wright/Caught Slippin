[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I know some youngsters that's all in the mix
Everyday they being taught to go hard on a bitch
This lifestyle will separate you from most
But see we different then Cali this pimping come with a twist
With a illegal escorting
Was making this shit a little easy now
Convince his main hoe she a queen just to keep her down
The bread maker I'm talking his top bottom piece
And you know she killing when she got that top model steez
Always about the bread that's the policy
But it's ashamed what she got to do for college fees
Yo I just may be too weak for my pimp side
But it's a full time job tryna get up in a bitch mind
I was broke and saw these niggas going big time
Look at Manny Fresh
I feel like my career was taking granny steps
But I know my success and they success
Won't have the same affect
But I'm still praying that you

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Provide or help or raise money like a charity
I'm learning respect is better than popularity
He loved the necessity of providing guidance
Essentials if he tell you different he lying
Aye yo every player done try to hear of an V.E.G
My partner said he ain't tripping 'cause she was fucking for free
But it's never too late to change your life you don't want to keep
That's why I went from the EBT to the TMT
Yeah I feel you dog
But I'm tryna convince these kids theirs a different way they could wake up and get it all
I know the nigga lost
All the hood lessons
How niggas rather have street credit then good credit
Fuck 'em if they don't fuck with me 'cause I fuck with me
Life's a joke can't you see they Donald Trumping me
He play the system I play the bitches that's dumb for me
Tell me the difference when they come for me
Keep praying that I

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, so I put my partner on the 4 agreements
He cool like Young Dro he be shoulder leaning
Real Vegas nigga game all clever
He be up to no good like he Carl Webber
Playing hard ball on them I'm talking 10-6
Work all night so all day she want revenge dick
Search the house for some clues like forensic
But if you over 21 be unpredictable
Yo I write the vision down then shoot the visual
She love me and she hate me at the same time
You'll never catch me pressing shit that I'm indifferent to
So I'm here to kick that real shit and change minds
Game time this a Dizzy Wright moment
I'm saying live your life but don't waste your life on it
He said life's a circus circus I just write on it
Then the police caught him with a gun and knife on him
