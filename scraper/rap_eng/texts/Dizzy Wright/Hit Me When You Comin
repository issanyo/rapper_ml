[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]

What if I told you that the only way to get on the radio
Was to rap about material shit
What if I told you that I went down to the radio station and told the owner to sit on a dick?
I hate these industry muthafuckers who think they know it all , cus' they came and they saw , and they been around
A lot's changed here buddy, and you ain't been in town cus' now Dizzy Wright is the nigga who got em' spinnin' round
Yeah , now I don't make music for everybody cus' not everybody's gunna understand the concept
Uh, cus' when maturity meets immaturity , shit, it just fucks with their mindset
So I just say fuck a hater if you hatin' I done made it outta Vegas , you a fan , your mind just ain't elevated
So when it does I'll be right here makin' real music, something with a little feel to it , hit me when you coming (Yuh)

[Hook:]

Fuck the game , ima do me
Turn it up and keep it too G (Yuh)
Fuck the game , ima do me
Turn it up and keep it too G (hit me when you coming)
(Let it ride nigga , let it ride)
(hit me when you coming)
(Let em know what's up nigga, you gotta let em know what's up nigga)

[Verse 2:]

What if I told you that these niggas say I'm Hollywood, cus I wanted to get payed for a show?
(Uh) What if I told you that the only way that I was gettin' payed is getting payed off a show?
So uhm , (hold up) fuck you mr. promoter, I worked my whole life to really get this shit poppin'
So I perform and you go home with some money and I'm leavin' without a penny in my pocket? Nigga please
I gotta eat, sad as can be, if it's my livin' why would I just be talented for free?
But I do, here's a clue, cus it's fun, and the only way to get noticed is being in the front
So uhm, I kinda figured out how ima do this, do my crazy shit and still spit that real music
Smooth movements, I do this, I'm foolish, and I'm sick of all the bullshit music, hit me when you coming

[Hook:]

Fuck the game , ima do me
Turn it up and keep it too G (Yuh)
Fuck the game , ima do me
Turn it up and keep it too G (hit me when you coming)
(Let it ride nigga , let it ride)
(hit me when you coming)
(Let em know what's up nigga, you gotta let em know what's up nigga)

[Verse 3:]

What if I told you that if Pac was here, I honestly believe that a lot of you rap niggas would not be here
Cus I done heard the worst mainstream shit that I swear this has to be the worst that mainstream get nigga
(Hold up) Fuck that lemme get em', fuck the game and every fake muthafucker in it
Don't take this as me dissin' or tryna get your attention, but I know damn well I have the right to have an opinion
You rapping but nobody understand you, how the fuck did you get held with a deal?
And I know your niggas ain't real, cus if they was real they woulda told you to develop your skill, so Ima be the one to tell you
