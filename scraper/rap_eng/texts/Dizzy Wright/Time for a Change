[Intro]
What up
Dizzy Wright nigga
I had to turn my motherfucking SWAG on

[Verse 1]
Look
East side Vegas where I'm at ho
Took a long time but we coming through the backdoor
21 young do anything I want turn a rap concert into a tat show
That cold better believe that we gats flows like people asshole
Man I'm wiling in this bitch
I'm styling need a couple hundred thousand
I don't see no haters smiling when I bring Funk Volume in this bitch
Hold up
Vegas on the map made it on the map
When you think of West Coast think of Dizzy Wright nigga
Put my whole life in this rap shit
Hear him talk down and that's the reason I don't like niggas
I was putting in my ground work
Down to earth sound surf till the sound work
Found the sound now I'm traveling around earth
Smoke the whole pound just to show them what the town worth

[Hook]
Like
Climbed up in the game
You a lame
I can tell you signed up for the fame
Yeah you might have a name
Its a shame
Cause we can see through everything that you ain't
I think its time for a change so they left it to a nigga like me
So its only right that I give it to them real
Shit I'm trying to make them think so its easier to live
So I tell them like
X2

[Verse 2]
Look if its hot then its probably this
Marijuana where the party is
I'm so out of the loop I talk shit when I walk in the booth
And hit a hater with a hockey stick
I got a problem with the ho's
Low key ho's proud of being ho's
Hide behind your Prada that's what bothers me the most
Say she ain't easy money make her come
So she try to see me and I ain't be acknowledging the ho
I'm popping up for shows getting dough
Sign a couple autographs and hit the door nigga what
You be on that sucky shit
Hit the club, hump a bitch, take a bitch, only can't get it up
Young nigga I'm one nigga
I don't like thirsty ass bitches that want niggas
Me I'm on some shit as hot as the sun nigga
Dumb figures that's getting me through to the dumb niggas

[Hook X2]

[Verse 3]
Tatted they don't really want to hear my voice
No choice I'm the hottest nigga doing it
Only being confident cause I ain't polotic my progress
Do it big I don't give a fuck who it is
1990 hooligan finna shoot again
I'mma get it in till they do me in
I told my niggas that I want the whole bank
Put the gas in the tank and tell all the homies scoot it in
Bitch we headed to the top ho top flow with the locked doors
Low key cause the cops close
Towel down yeah we got smoke
Never with the drama
Do a show and then we outro
I told Vegas I was down for it
Passion sex and then lounge on it
Heard them hating but I'm to busy to be around for it
Now I'm certain these niggas stupid
Cause me I am purposely perfect with all of my verses
I tell'em like
