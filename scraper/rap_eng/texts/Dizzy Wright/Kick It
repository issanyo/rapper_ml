[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
What did I get myself into?
Thinking about what I been through
I’m getting’ famous but I been cool
I used to ditch school, now I do shows and get boo’d
Nah, I’m playing, I’m praying more. Rapping, saying more
Got a voice so I'm traveling out of Vegas more
I love it, switching up the subject
The only thing I’m switching Cause I’m sticking to the man in the public
Ran into a plan with my hand in the bucket
I ain't tripping cause I plan to be buzzing
Plan to be noticed, plan to be heard
Everything I deserve, switching up the words
Boy you got your nerve, putting in work
My position good so I’m fixing to hit em where it hurt
And trust me dog you don’t wanna be the first
Dizzy Wright too nice with the verse, keep it moving

Check my characteristics
Havin’ fun is my one and only business
Makin’ a livin’ off of livin’
I came, I saw, I kicked it

Only young once, and I don’t wanna miss it
Causin’ trouble, don’t you dare get it twisted
Makin’ a livin’ off of livin’
I came, I saw, I kicked it

[Verse 2: PeeVee]
Keep it moving? I guess that mean its my turn
They told me stop killing these beats, one day I might learn
One day I might earn, enough to support my family
Live this reality, then I’ll escape back here to fantasy
Where the kids are dope, but that ain’t what they sell
And their dreams go much further than a cell
Where they focus on god, and they avoiding hell
That’s my click, n’ we rolling like the cartel
All we wanna do is kick it, no pun intended
We be up In da club, not cause cent did it
PeeVee, Lyndon, n’ Dizzy, now the teams complete
Coming at ya strong, I mean who’s gone compete?
Cause this ain't a game, but if it was we won
Cause we ain't rapping for chains, this here’s for fun
Me and my boys here to stay, for the long run
And our time starts now, cause we’ve just begun

Check my characteristics
Havin’ fun is my one and only business

I came, I saw, I kicked it

Only young once, and I don’t wanna miss it
Causin’ trouble don’t you dare get it twisted
Makin’ a livin’ off of livin'
I came, I saw, I kicked it

[Verse 3: Lyndon]
For the people singin along
My flow is like Hennessey in a song
It’s bout to be one of the all-time greats don’t get it wrong
Let me address this question then get to getting along
How did 49 states and ESPN get it wrong?
Anyway finish the chapter that I been on
Finish packin my bags, text mom, tell her im gone
To the beach for the week, chill with villains its been too long
Even tho I sad week, believe that I’m goin strong
Im feelin like the artful dodger
Just a pocket pickin kid playin cops and robbers
With nerf guns. the surfs up? we hit the water
What’s the worst about this week? Nada
Everything about this life is so exceptional
And everything bout these haters is unacceptable
Who was it that said this night wouldn’t be incredible?
My message to you – forget it, it’s unforgettable
