[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Damn, what has the world come to
I swear that we used to be slaves
And Martin Luther King had a dream
And I bet that he turnin' over in his grave
Look at how we behave, my black people
We dont even act equal, we act evil
Why, because its easy and we see diamonds and then our favorite rappers go off and preach violence, for weak minded
Because we follow that shit
We went from leaders, to be followin' shit
So we bottle it in like we dont see it
When we know we believe it
So im hear to make you change for a reason, my black people

[Hook]
Uhh, I'm just a kid from Las Vegas
And I ain't trynna come up like I'm racist
And lately, I've been feelin like we act evil
So I had to do this for my black people
Time to make a change
Sayin' it loud, I'm black and I'm proud [x3]
And im about to make a change starting now

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
I look at the generation under us
And I wonder how they gone do it
Our great grandparents fought for our rights
Now we got them and we sit up and abuse em
Its time to make a change, but I ain't god
Yall ain't gonna listen
Yall just gonna sit up and nod
And tell me that im hot and say I need a deal
If it come, then it come, but im talking about whats real
It takes one day
It takes one smile
Put your fist up, put the gun down
Nigga be a man
Dont do what you can for nothing
Cause if your gonna stand better stand for somethin'
Black people wanna know why they winning
Wanna know why we looked at so different
Cause we allow these little black children to raised by a fucking television
Are you kidding me dog
You teaching kids how to be fresh, but you forget to teach them how to have some respect
So they walk around without it
Never whats up
We need to teach these kids to be better than us
But we dont, so why bother
If we won't, than why offer
Life's crazy but it gets a little harder
We like being flashy
But we love being fathers my black people

[Hook]

Uhh, Im just a kid from Las Vegas
And I ain't trynna come up like I'm racist

So I had to do this for my black people
Time to make a change

And im about to make a change starting now
And we go'n do it like this
Put your fist in the air if you feel this [x3]
This is a public announcement
Put your fist in the air if you feel this [x3]
This is a public announcement

Uhh, Im just a kid from Las Vegas
