[Verse 1]
She said, "Can you accept that I am ready for my death?"
Got a baby boy and I ain't got no help
His father up in jail
And while he sittin' in his cell praying for us
I'm just sitting my by self
Nigga left me alone
Had to provide a home
Young women taking care of my baby
All on my own
Going to school
Can you imagine being raped by the only father figure
That you ever fuckin' knew
So hell yeah I'm bitter
And I probably won't fuck with you
I'm fucked up and I got trust issues
My ex boyfriend beat me
Repeatedly, I'm free at last
I was immune to being treated bad
He took my soul
Made me want to give up
And now I'm in this nasty ass strip club
Trying to get a dolla
So you can really judge when you holla
But the devil makes it hardah
So I got one question

[Hook]
Can you accept my flaws? [x10]

[Verse 2]
He said, "I dropped out of school for the street life"
Shit, I just wanted to be a daddy
I started slangin' this weed to get this money
Just so I could make my baby momma happy
Easy money
Fuck it, it's keeping me stable
Keeping the bills paid
And keeping food on the table
See I'm fucked up in the head
And you would be too
If you watched yo momma open her legs
Just to get ya'll some bread
Baby girl I am dead to the world
I don't wanna be here
I see clear, and this shit I see
Is what we fed
I bleed tears
I'm different, I watch the women downgrade herself for a livin'
So I'm picky when I'm picking for the women that I'm feelin'
Me and my brother were abandoned children
Sex was appealing
I had to be all of nine
And by 13, I wanted sex, all the time
Sad right
I just felt like I was caged with this info
So can you accept that I was raised as a nimpho
Trying to better myself from all this shit that I been through
So it's not about sex
But that's the shit that I'm in to
Yea, so can you accept my flaws
Overlook my bads and try to knock down these walls
That I built when I was lonely
Trying to shray away from all
Or would you just tell me that it's too hard

[Hook]
Can you accept my flaws? [x10]
Accept me for who I am
Accept me
No no, don't judge me on what I am?
Accept me
