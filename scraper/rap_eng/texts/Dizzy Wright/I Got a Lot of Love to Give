[Verse 1]
Okay I, woke up feeling motivated
A little marijuana for the motivation
One hitters, blunt splitters
We've been smoking cause I had you niggas suffocating
I'm styling yo, my outfit got em double-taking
You tell me what's the Triple H, the Undertaker
We dropping triple-doubles every night
And Dizzy Wright'll be the player on the mic
Hold on nigga, lemme fuck it up
(Fuck it up then, fuck it up then)
Ain't nobody dancing let me start it off
Henney got me feeling way above the law
Why you on the wall? Why you ain't involved nigga?
We the center of attention from these parties to the blogs nigga
Standing on they palms, yeah we want it all nigga
So we never mind the people standing in the club
Pour you a shot, and double up, then smoke a honey dutch
Bitch I'm still moving, I'm knowing they gon come with us
A 1990's baby and I'm coming up
Yo, the youngest of the pack
I'm the sipping the yak, and with the rap
I'm two stepping, you can tell I love the buzz
Anyways I'm, just way too god damn well minded
I got a wet n' wild one, cloud 9ning
I feel like everybody need a get away
The method behind the madness, everyday is a different day

[Verse 2]
I'm not the one you should sleep on
This is strictly for them cheek bones
So keep smiling whenever you bringing me along
Go along fast, but go too far you gon need to bring a team along
Follow me as I'm recording live
Getting organised, handling business with the stoner eyes
Phenomenon on my legacy
I'm a legend, no way your ahead of me
Cause this music ain't banging more than mine
But good luck bruh, it's hard to make it
When you got the game fucked up, so peace and love to ya
Same niggas hating, wanna say wassup to ya
You wanna hang around, nigga we know you a clown
Smoking loud with a daddy hat
Bitch I been popping since Daddy Mac
Fatties back to back, and I don't wanna have to Drake a nigga
I did this one for all my Vegas niggas, we bringing love back
