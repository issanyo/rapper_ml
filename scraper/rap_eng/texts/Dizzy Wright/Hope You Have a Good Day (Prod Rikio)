[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
She wake up late to work
Get up and make it work
Quick on hotels irritated but still the ladies first
She know she need some work
Quickly was acting wrong
And self-improvement is the movement we can’t leave alone
She good to reason with
She hide and in need of shit
She know to be the shit she actually gotta be legit
I hear and breath it hard, when I open waking up
And I just can’t see it all, but I don’t wanna be involved
It's little things I happen to see
Without you notice I see you practicing what we preach
So when we look over that’s the reason I’m acting in sleep
‘cause being you is what I’m happy to see
So this my remind of you

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
You you, do-do dou-dou-dou-dou
Hope you have a good day
I hope you have a good day
Do do i dou do-do dou-dou-dou-dou...
I hope you have a good day, good day

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
No time for the games, she runnin’ with things
She wake up smiling and even know she been through lot of things
She cherish her life, sleeps gay through the night
Prepare for the fight ‘cause you’re such a queen
No make believe you was real as they come, right?
Tell ‘em take it or leave it, ‘cause you’re getting it done
Look! Check you out! Will you be stepping out
You know you Cuban niggas extra out, mhm
I got a thing for you, I wanna sing for you
Like do do do do do
The Frankie Beverly flow so, what can I say?
Here’s some soul for you I hope you have a good day
I hope you’re smiling

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
The world is better with you
Don’t let these niggas get you
Dismiss you,diss you, make you feel unofficial
People come with issues, what you’re learning from
Long as you’re happy ain’t concerning that’s how they hear you burning up
You need to bring the temperature down
A broken heart is just a room, you carry with it in style
Oh shit, mama she no living for now
And are you kidding and I grab her hand and I twist her around
We do this saucy in this bitch she’s laughing and I’m whillin'
Can’t dance I just like to see my lady smiling
Fallin’ asleep and I’ll be too in advance
Motivation for when you wake up and do it again
I hope you know
