[Intro]
Let your soul accept it, so unexpected

[Verse 1]
What if I told you I was lost
My vision bad but I could see me in the future being a boss
Given orders and order to holla at my supporters
I need somebody to give me a call, shit
Tell me I'm loved, tell me you proud of me
Cause shits changed
Its taking a whole lot outta me
My daddy don't love me
Or maybe he do, but he ain't around
I hope you know I ain't just laying around, shit
I got off my ass and I chose to get it in
I turned my homies into buisness men
So I just gotta sin
Put on the city of sin with my friends
Now me and all of my niggas pitchin in
I hope you understand, this ain't a sob story
I did this by myself
No one did the job for me
I took a different route
Wright road into discussion
Took a minute to bubble
Now we on the finishing touches
Now I'm all in public
And I love it
Not cause im buzzin
In God we trust
I'm asking god can you guide me love
So much to believe, too much to retrieve
I just hope I get it out before I leave

Hook:
Man I gotta be remembered(x2)
Yeah cause when its all said and done
And they take me off this Earth
I just hope you realize what I was worth
Putting in work
So I can be remembered

[Verse 2]
Its cool cause my momma's a little more involved
When she gives me problems I just smoke it off
She said she loves my message so she's quick to show me off
I know enough but I don't know it all
I listen it all my big hommies
To get advice as a man
I grew up trifling but tried to advance
Even when I was six
I got a pick with a mic in my hand
Im proud of myself I like where I am
See I just want to be heard
Respected and comfortable
Even when im away say daddy still lovin you
Typical tho, you into your toys im into my flows
But baby girl it takes a minute to blow
So I swallow my pride
Spit the truth and now they follow my ride
I make visuals for my visions
And now they follow my rhymes
Thank god for my blessings
I grew up unprotected
Not neglected, stressed a little, seen a talent and perfect it
So when you let them know about me
Let them know I gotta be remembered

[Hook]
Yeah cause when its all said and done
And they take me off this earth
I just hope you realize what I was worth
Putin in words
So I can be remembered

[Verse 3]
Ain't no shame in the way I act
Its a way of life
You way out the facts
You livin a lie, we live and we die
Who gives a fuck
They only judging cause we live it up
And barely gettin by
But I still keep a smile on my face
I learned how to set my negatives to the side
And just smile thru the day
Some times it gets overwhelming
Coming down off my high
Getting depressed with all this shit I dealt with
I feel selfish but let me make that shit a little clearer
I ain't rude I just need to work on the man in the mirror
Starting from where I lack
Look back to were I was at
So I can see the growth
You can even hear it in my raps
Potential great
May half of these niggas disintegrate
You limit yourself you've been a fake
Me, i've been around
You know me from my beginner stage
And now im in this bitch to leave you in a maze

[Hook]
Dizzy Wright
So tell em mother fuckers I gotta be remembered
Dizzy Wright
Cause when its all said and done
And they take me off this earth
I just hope you realize what I was worth
Putin in words
So I can be remembered

End:
Hey, hey
Man I gotta be remembered
Don't speak upon me unless you got somethin positive to say nigga
If anything negative about me
You heard it, you seen it, fuck it dont even believe it
Im fighting off my demons tryna make it to the top motha fucka
Fuck what your doin and fuck what you got
Im on my own shit
