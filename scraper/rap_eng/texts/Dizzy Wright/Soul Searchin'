[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Hip Hop I hope I last
I'm tryna better myself, tryna get better at my craft
And I just wanna be successful in the game
But I'm always getting caught up in my past
I'm Soul Searchin
I'm Soul Searchin (I promise you I'm Soul Searchin)
I'm Soul Searchin (Man I'm only Soul Searchin)
I'm Soul Searchin (Yeah I'm Soul Searchin)
I'm looking for my own person

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Uhh
I'm tryna find myself in this cold industry
I'm tryna adapt to these pretty hoes into me
I'm tryna hit the top, reincarnate Pac
Just so he can come back to this world just to mentor me
I wanna change lives and smoke weed
Aim high and stay low key
See that's my motto for life
No need for bottles and ice
See you be following lames, and I be following Christ
I'm Soul Searchin!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Yeah
Bring change to the brains of the students
Who know nothing bout loyalty, community, and unit
Or make music for the foolish to get ruthless
Lazy niggas who sit down and make excuses
Damn, the world is filled with opportunity
And musically, all this screamin shit is new to me
I'm thankful but if I'm ever at an angle
And I don't really respond it's cause I'm tryna do it suitably
I wanna touch off like the Jacksons
And I will because I believe in the Laws of Attraction
I'm attracted to the stuff that's in the basket
You know the one with the cash, that the church is always passin'
Yeah, lord forgive me for my actions
My passion is starting to take over me
I'm in this hell hole, keeping God close to me
Soul Searchin for the older me
I hope you understand

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
Yeah
I thank God that I ain't God
That's like having ten kids and working eight jobs
Impossible to the T, follow me to the O
Uplift me with yo words, and join me at the P
The top muhfucka, bad days and hypocrites
I just started and I'm sick of it
This for the people at the end of it
This for the Sin City sinners sittin in prison
When they really innocent
I got problems, like any other human
So when you see me smilin', it's only for my movement
I move minds with my music, easy!
Black people black everything, Jeezy
Niggas on my side believe in what I see
So when I'm talkin bout I, I'm really talkin bout we
Flashy, but please don't let the name fool ya
This is knowledge spittin game to ya
I'm Soul Searchin!

[Chorus]

Uh
Let the mind work
It's just me and my family
I rather win your respect
Before I go off and win a grammy
I'm Soul Searchin
I promise you that I'm Soul Searchin
I swear that I'm only Soul Searchin
Tryna find myself
I'm looking for my own person
Uhh
