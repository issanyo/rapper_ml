[Verse 1]
Yo, woke up this morning, crucial timing
My son crying, I'm back to them daddy duties
Yo I be lying if I ain't say I was happy when raising my kids
Even with the changing diapers and wiping booty
Life is truly a trip for me
Being a father is a gift to me
Family and music, this is it for me
Yo this remind me of them '09 days
Driving by where I graduated just for old times sakes
Thinking of when they used to say "What you wanna be in ten years?"
Looking at the teacher crazy like "Bitch, do you know where we live?"
The whole time I had hope, I just didn't know how to feel
I fell deep in my thoughts, I can't be playing the field
Especially if I want a family like Jada and Will
Yo who inspires you that spoke their mind and ain't been killed
Mentally beaten down
Broken down to the point it's hard to hold on to and smile
My eyes is all dried out, I mean

[Hook]
Fuck fake love, fuck fake love
Yo I can't focus on the pain no more
Fuck fake love, fuck fake love
It ain't about the shit that you claim no more
Fuck fake love, fuck fake love
Oh, niggas don't think they need to change no more
Fuck fake love, fuck fake love
Just do what you love, that's what we came here for

[Verse 2]
Ayo use a hundred thousand for a hundred thousand words
It was just to talk to bitches like I'm Howard Stern
I've learned that only cowards turn
Shit well maybe not only
But leave it up to the homies whenever the tables turn
They gon' confront your ass, turn them into punching bags
I'm always calming niggas down so we don't be where trouble at
Retrace my steps and double back and I'm reminded that
It's niggas with no niggas and they fine with that
Yo are you kidding, since day one I been J Kidding
Throwing assists, that Chris Paul to Blake Griffin
They selling a fake vision
Fake love and fake niggas get exposed for portraying in a different image
This life we living a scrimmage, God sub me in
When you got kids you live for them, I need another ten
I need a lifetime partner, let's stack a couple M's
Let's get this savings right, I'm obviously not playing right

[Hook]
Fuck fake love, fuck fake love
Yo I can't focus on the pain no more
Fuck fake love, fuck fake love
It ain't about the shit that you claim no more
Fuck fake love, fuck fake love
Oh, niggas don't think they need to change no more
Fuck fake love, fuck fake love
Just do what you love, that's what we came here for

[Bridge]
Let's switch it up
I'm a slave in my mind but I know God
So I'll be where I wanna be in no time
We only spreading peace when we throw signs
I had a vision now I'm living the proof
But I'm a slave in my mind, I'm glad know God
So I'll be where I wanna be in no time
We only spreading peace when we throw signs
I had a vision now I'm living the proof

[Hook]
Fuck fake love, fuck fake love
Yo I can't focus on the pain no more
Fuck fake love, fuck fake love
It ain't about the shit that you claim no more
Fuck fake love, fuck fake love
Oh, niggas don't think they need to change no more
Fuck fake love, fuck fake love
Just do what you love, that's what we came here for
