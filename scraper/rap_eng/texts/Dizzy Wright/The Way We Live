[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
They been stealin' our culture for years
We the ones with the ideas
Tell 'em this is the way that we live
This is the way that we live
I heard that it's kill or be killed
My niggas we stay in the field
Tell 'em this is the way that we live
This is the way that we, this is the way that we live
This is the way that we, this is the way that we live
This is the way that we, this is the way that we live
They been stealin' our culture for years
We the ones with the ideas
Tell 'em this is the way that we, this is the way that we live

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
This is the way that we live
It's my time I got somethin' to give
We creatin' shit but didn't have the money for the funding or the fundamental skills
Took it from us, left us in the field
Now we back and better, smart as ever
Fuck 'em if they tryna take it from us
We gon' build our own shit it's now or never
They gon' judge a young nigga regardless
Movin' quiet, yup we louder than a choir
Can't be out here as a target
I be tryna tell the homies bein' [?]
Keep it real ain't even fascinated
To 2Pac and get assassinated
Give us credit for the culture
Since y'all ran with it and tried to marinate it
Brought the '80s back on purpose
If the laws reversed you wouldn't think that it's worth it
Son downtown I'm in a hurry
You ain't prolly never felt this discouraged
I ain't trippin' look at the shit we invented
All these Hip-Hop sounds that the legends given
I ain't no politician but I wanna inspire a lot of difference
Told the homie

[Verse 2: Price]
I'm feeling like Benjamin Bradley, Benjamin Montgomery
Black man I need my money please
Hold up, let me name drop
They cleaned us out and left us brainwashed
Now he in he hood, lettin' that thang pop
And she in the hood letttin' that thang drop
Go on tour they in the same spot
Young guns won't stop, no they can't stop
Each one, teach one
I learned the blueprint from [?] boy
Pull up on Dizzy and chief one (smoke it up)
Young king of Vegas right next to Floyd
Quit the loud talk, we don't respect the noise
I respect the action and the proof
So don't let that pussy distract you from the truth
See that ass clap on steppin' get trapped up in that Coupe
Hold on, can't be a chicken tryna soar with eagles (do it do it)
I'm on a mission to restore the people (whip it up)
Young Price, free minded and freedom fighting
Bring the pie to my team and we divide it up
We never gon' win if we're divided
I get the tree, I light it then get enlightened
Cause the music ain't leavin' me excited
I can't hide it, but we concocted the start to keep the cycle

[Verse 3: Oktane]
The homies told me to go crazy on this
So it's only right that I go crazy on it
Came prepared for this, you can't be trained
'Bout to run the game, and nothin' sprained
So for real, candy rain
Now we gettin dollars and demandin' change
Fire spittin', nigga, flame flame
Hot lava, Oktane, same thing
This a giant to a midget, I feel Jordan off the pivot
Most of the shit you double tap on Instagram nigga I done did it
I really seen the world, I really lived it
And a lil nigga got the vision
I remember no pot to piss in
And we sat up plottin' mission with not one spot left without the scripture
I'm the never-sober chief that smokes the reefer
The boy that knows your chick and blows the cheese
But how does it do it? The never seen a nigga this fly
Don't kiss and tell, expose the diva
Many occasions I could've chosen singin'
Necessity in the game, it doesn't need you
On the one, why you throw with the close reciever
Praise black Jesus for chosen leaders and I'm gone
