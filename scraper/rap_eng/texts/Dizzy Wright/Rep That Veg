(Verse:1)
Well its that east side Las Vegas rapping motherfucka
Dizzy be the name and there will never be another
Posted with my brother im high dont do me
Mosky got the weed so I hit my sister noony
While it slides right through me
Got me feeling lifted im too busy to be twisting so I let my nigga get it
See I smoke while im shitting
Smoke while im pissing
I be smoking for a mother fuckin living
It's sad but I ain't mad im just another outcast
My AT Aliens know all about that
Homie im on, and I ain't talking about the ownage you think
Las Vegas is the home of the ink
See my weed hella stinking thats probably why I smell like that
And when its gone I get the smell right back
My new name is dooby, her new name is hootchy
If you feelin suttin gooey then I nutted on your booty everybody just...

(Hook)
Throw your hands in the air
And wave em' like you just dont care
And if bumping my hits and you feeling this shit everybody let me hear you say okayier
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave em' like you just dont care
And if driving down the strip
And you feeling this shit everybody let me hear you say okayier

(Verse:2)
Ho get up out my way im tryna' get this bread
And no I do not wanna' fuck but you can give me head
Ho stop being thirsty tryna' open yo legs
And if you can not remember im tatted on your head
See I keep it so blunt, speaking of a blunt im bout to go me roll me one right now
Im rolling wit the bro im bout to cop a zip for da low
Cuz them souped days getting kinda old
Im bout to hit the west I gotta' hit my nigga Mr. Philly up
Gitty up we about to turn the fucking city up
See ima younging but im running to the top
Smoking hella pot listening to pac everybody just...

(Hook)
Throw your hands in the air
And wave em'; like you just dont care
And if bumpin my hits and you feeling this shit everybody let me hear you say okayier
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave em 'like you just dont care
And if driving down the strip
And you feeling this shit everybody let me hear you say okayier
