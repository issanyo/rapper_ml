[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Uh, back up in your face again
Living for the moment you better take it in
Yeah I know my paper thin
The shit I say'll help you save a friend
Tell em' quit bitching and start making plans
I don't sit around baby sitting
You want to sit around being broke well I ain't hanging with you
We comfortably complain
Ain't no thing to niggas we use to it
We see somebody hurting fuck them we YouTube it
We, free niggas need to think bigger
Small talk and I don't need niggas
We a dying breed
Don't follow me because I'm as cool as it gets
Follow me because I'm fully equipped
Let me ring a bell
I told my daddy I don't never wanna see a jail
Disturbed, rolling herb with dirty finger nails
I'mma keep living till they bury me
But its scary cause I'm seeing who they compare to me
I'm still soul searching

Keep it impeccable
Hip Hop
Yo keep it impeccable
You ain't hip hop if you ain't sayin' nothin'

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Uh, Verse two and I'm back at it
You rap good but you lack passion I can see the flaws
Learn from them i don' seen it all
Triflin' Nigga, I was raised around folks who couldn't keep a job
Never judge cause it was what it was
The sheltered nights when i was cuddled up with my blood
When all we had was us and we use to discuss
They complain about what they got we complain cause its not enough
I wish, I didn't have to ask for more
And going backwards was the last resort
Can you feel that
Uh, its natural for me to spill it out
Lead by example man, chill it out
No need for the bitter rout
I know we come from different worlds
But its cool to be a student to the ins and outs, yeah
Beyond all the power and the pressure
We agree to make a effort for the better
Impeccable

[Hook]
