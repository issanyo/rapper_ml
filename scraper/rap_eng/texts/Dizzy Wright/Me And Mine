[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
I wake up

[Chorus]
I wake up and I take care of me and mine
I gotta keep this money flowing for me and mine
What you living for? I go to war for me and mine
When you talking about them greats keep me in minds
Icon, icon, I just know I needed time
I wake up and I take care of me and mine
I gotta keep this money flowing for me and mine
What you living for? I go to war for me and mine

[Verse 1]
Icon, icon, icon tell my haters play the clip
Moonwalk like I'm Jaden Smith
Thank God cause I made a grip
I feel like my time is now
Might play the game, got player guilt
Only kings and queens my G, we do not allow no haters here
Tell my momma her jam is on
Y'all better get y'all camera phones
Ten toes down I stand alone
Niggas out here got scary bones
I don't even know what the fuck y'all on
But I guess I'll smoke (I smoke, I smoke)
All this money I made (I made)
And I still play broke, God damn
God damn I work too hard just to let this fly
Just to let this fly
And we can't hide away from the things that we love
If we all gon' die
And I know life fucked up but when the sun come up better take it outside
Small world but the whole world waiting
I let my melanin energize

[Chorus]
I wake up and I take care of me and mine
I gotta keep this money flowing for me and mine
What you living for? I go to war for me and mine
When you talking about them greats keep me in minds
Icon, icon, I just know I needed time
I wake up and I take care of me and mine
I gotta keep this money flowing for me and mine
What you living for? I go to war for me and mine

[Verse 2]
I'm a Vegas star, this that motivation dog
I can't lose my confidence
Still waiting on that Jay Z call
I been going crazy hard
Finesse the bag for me and mine
I been on that alkaline, pH level 9.5
Put my fam on game for sure
This feel like them gaming shows
Spread my light like Snoop Lion
Bossing up like Snoop 2.0
Bitch play your roll
All through the day
Please don't give your power away
Hard money in like the big homie Nipp
Independent niggas getting all in the way
God damn, God damn
God damn I work too hard just to let this fly
Just to let this fly
I wanna see the homies put down a lane for the weed and we all stay high
Whole world waking up, stay woke my G
Gotta open up your eyes
I'ma take it outside no wait
I let my melanin energize cause...

[Chorus]
I wake up and I take care of me and mine
I gotta keep this money flowing for me and mine
What you living for? I go to war for me and mine
When you talking about them greats keep me in minds
Icon, icon, I just know I needed time
I wake up and I take care of me and mine
I gotta keep this money flowing for me and mine
What you living for? I go to war for me and mine
