[Verse 1]
The sun is outside, so you know I got my levels strong
Never home, but positive vibes what I'm forever on (what I'm forever on)
It's shit I grew up doin' that I left alone (I had to leave it alone)
They came out of them mountains with that devil song
Singing to us, causin' confusion like they ain't the ones that bring it to us
But I ain't pointin' no fingers, but middle finger to 'em
I'm sayin' fuck 'em, learn the truth and I'm disgusted, that's the reason you fiendin' for it
Let me break it down for you young dudes
Mic check 1, 2, from The Growing Process to the processed food
We on the State Of Mind 2 shit now
Had to make em' sit down and be Humble to make the truth stick out
Fuck a cool kid crowd, if your mind ain't important to you
They will fill you up with drugs and stick a fork into you
You just a different beast to be eatin'
You ain't gotta go vegan to let 'em know you ain't sleeping

[Hook]
Yeah
So, I'm hydrated I been on an alkaline diet (Yes I have)
Would you change if you knew that they was lying? (Yes I will)
Do you follow religion or follow science? (Let me know)
I know that's the reason we dying (That's why)

[Verse 2]
I know you ain't paying attention to that meddy
That's that medicine your doctor got you on heavy (Yup!)
Your mood edgy
Take them meatballs off your spaghetti
Rest in peace to Dr. Sebi
I just booked a flight to Honduras, but I just can't right my wrongs (not at all)
Always golden, but my problems twice as long
Judge me if you want, but homie, what type of life you want
You niggas is still making jokes
It's always the funny ones
That had the hardest time putting down them honey buns
I understand that you don't know how to become the sun
Grow your vegetables and fruits
And then pitch it to the youth, but me and you should have a one-on-one
I had this feeling
The more I got to diggin' that
I been realized we shouldn't eat the shit we been killing in
I can't be stuck in a trance
It was already fuck the police, but now it's fuck the whole plan

[Hook]
Yeah
