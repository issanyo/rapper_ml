[Intro]
Yezzir
Tim Westwood what's good
We in the building
Funk Volume's in the building
Uguala(?)
Uhh

[Verse: Dizzy Wright]
Yo
God's child, I been at it since birth
Raised with a head on my shoulders so I use 'madam' and 'sir'
Yes sir
If you attending then you in for a treat
Just sit in your seats
Be fascinated and flattered with words
Uh
I got no time to be somebody I'm not
A legend in my city its time for me to step out the box
Flesh wounds and all, it's nothing I can't maintain
I been through it all without knowing who to call
My trust issues start developing
Losing my virginity was like letting the devil in
Pussy was good but too young to let the pressure in
Took all of my focus off getting my education
And being more like a testament
Of a young nigga that got something too early
Young player instantly became a Mac like Bernie
I coulda did anything that I put my mind to
But who woulda thought? Rap would be the journey
Writing down my life while these other niggas need help with a hook
I shouldn't have to put you on, learn from the steps that i took
Yo, a positive self image is why I'm in it
And you ain't winning until you learn to put yourself on the book
You want a freestyle? you catch me off camera bruh
I don't waste time I'm using all these platforms to take advantage of
The shit I gotta say
Fuck a Youtube comment that don't accommodate
Ion' know them niggas from around the way
I ain't get no big ass check, nigga we found a way
While you passing judgement, we ask for justice
Kids in Ferguson just don't hash tag for nothing
Talk bad and hit yo ass with a trumpet
FUCK boy, you know you had this shit coming
You a bitch, we all battle with something
Fuck the critics
Half of these niggas wouldn't understand until they lived it
But half of that have or probably never even get it
But it's cool to me, all this celebrity shit is new to me
With all these new fans that try to tell me who to be
Truthfully, y'all could suck my dick
No here's a dildo bitch, suck on that. BITCH!
N Tim excuse my profanity but I feel like I'm a mix
Of Dave Chappelle and Andre three stacks, facts
Money good but it make me feel detached
That marijuana make me feel relax
Dizzy Wright nigga

[Outro]
Yiggity yomp to the yomp yomp yomp
Tim Westwood what's good?
Funk Volume in the building baby
Uhh
