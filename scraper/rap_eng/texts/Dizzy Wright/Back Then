[Intro: Euroz]
They wanna see you doing good
Just not better than them
Imagine that

[Verse 1: Euroz]
Huh
You can find me at the top
This where luck can't take ya
I'd done ran out of fuck and favors
The expression that my haters make they just can't take it
To see a nigga come up and rise above fan favorites
Thoughts that be residing in my head
Does she fuck with me for me, or she just tryna get ahead
These days meeting contracts and [?]
Searching for partnership if not I'm signing me instead
I let go and let God, I don't ever stress
I smoke kush, never stress
Give you line on top of line, that's the letter X
I went to jail and found rap and for that I'm forever blessed
Sleep that's for broke niggas I don't ever rest
Promises I've made but I've never kept
If they ain't real we ain't around such
Blood, sweat, and tears, built it from the ground up

[Hook]
Huh
Praise going up
God's blessings just fall on me
It's me against the world
No matter the odds bet it all on me
I'm just trying to live
No time to waste so I start homie
Back then they didn't know me
Now I'm hot they all on me
Back then they didn't want me
Now I'm hot they all on me
Back then they didn't want me
Now I'm hot they all on me
Back then they didn't want me
Now I'm hot they all on me
All on me, all on me, all on me

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Las Vegas legend (he a legend)
Seven years been on this shit since '07 ('07)
Did it first so which nigga gon' do it second (it don't matter)
Kill em' with kindness be signing without a weapon (peace signs)
But they don't like that so they compete to feel complete (riight)
Funny, now everybody compare themself to me (riight)
Playing for keeps accomplished all this shit by 23
Amazing
The Golden Age got me where I wanna be (wanna be)
Now the world anticipating on me to lead
My response is who got me
Niggas wanna be put on while sloppy and then they knock me (right)
My daughter's three years and before she learn how to potty
I learned and realized that this rap shit is not for everybody (real shit)
So I'm keeping my shit solid
They lying about catching bodies you niggas wouldn't even cock (keep it real)
Stayin' polished, corny niggas get demolished
Spit knowledge and don't even get acknowledged
But it's cool

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Euroz]
Huh
A stand up nigga, ovation shit
A different chick in every city that's locationships
It's not the situation, more like what you make of it
The chick you layin' next to or the cat you splittin' franklins with
The same story, just different pages
And I don't drive much I get driven places
This nostalgic, Rebecca [?] basement
Classic shit we be longing is what I've been busy making
Make way for a new legend
I feel it's that time
Cash ain't coming like it used to so I tend to stack mine
Hip hop on its death bed its finna flatline
The major labels is dyin' let us indie cats shine
They don't care about the art
They putting on for the bitches
Blow the advance, they know hoes long for the riches
I'm like a nigga who don't understand paintings
I had to ask myself what's wrong with this picture

[Hook]
