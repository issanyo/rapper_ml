I got that pack from Freeze

[Hook]
You gon' just sit here and waste my time like that
Like I'm fine with that; fuck yo attitude
You should roll this weed and let your mind relax
Take yo time with that; fuck yo attitude
You gon' just sit here and waste my time like that
Like I'm fine with that; fuck yo attitude
You should roll this weed and let your mind relax
Take yo time with that; fuck yo attitude

[Verse 1]
Let your mind relax
Don't like that fake shit like US almanacs (Nope)
Take that knee like Colin Kaep' (Yup)
But they still do not get the point
They need a bit and they don't want to hear me out
Zone me out and then I lit the joint
Don't turn me up, if you gon' miss the point
Same message, just a different voice (Yee)
Wisdom, strength, and beauty, that's the real meaning of God in the flesh (It is)
Funny 'cause you're working day and night, but give credit to everyone else (Gah damn)
I ain't cut through to debate (Nah)
It's obvious we need the help (We do)
Tell me what them fallen angels is, are we aliens? Hell yeah
Shielded by the sun, fuck the shade, I get my energy and I exhale
No negative energy I inhale
Medical science has failed (It has)
On a scale from 1-10, how you feel, how you been? (I don't know)
They fill us up with medicine
Hoe, don't let it settle in
Outta my mind man I'm miles out (Right, right)
Wake up man the time's now
Rest in peace to Amy Winehouse
I just follow all the signs now
I know exactly what God gave me
This is the righteous way, follow us
No hate in my heart for haters, but sittin' here lookin' at Donald Trump like what the?

[Hook]
You gon' just sit here and waste my time like that
Like I'm fine with that; fuck yo attitude
You should roll this weed and let your mind relax
Take yo time with that; fuck yo attitude
You gon' just sit here and waste my time like that
Like I'm fine with that; fuck yo attitude
You should roll this weed and let your mind relax
Take yo time with that; fuck yo attitude

[Verse 2]
Look, I ain't celebrating they victories (Nope)
Remixin' our history (Right)
Then, they try to call 'em holidays (Damn)
I'm tryin' not to let this get to me, ay
Why ya'll thankful for this stolen land?
But walk around trying to judge the thieves
Mama had 5 kids, but she could barely even live, 'cause nothing's free
Judge me if you want, fuck it, I'm ready for war you suckers don't want it with me
Children of the sun, eatin' acidic food, brodee can barely run up the street
I hope you niggas don't run up that check for yo homies and still be forgettin' these queens (Live by your means)
We in a corporation spell in this American Dream
I know you know
The justice system, they gon' do the most
Take us to jail for a new parole
White boy got 3 months for raping shorty, how he get out and Meek Mill got 2-4
I don't know, that's the world that we're livin' in
Look at all these crowded ghetto homes that they got my niggas in
No giving up, won't catch me givin' in
Can't stop, can't lose
He said that's my State of Mind 2
Nigga's like finally brodee your battles inspire me, keep givin' people the truth
No hate in my heart for the haters, but if we ain't off that OG, then we ain't in the mood
You know how we roll
When you find out that your body is a vehicle for your soul
Quit actin' slow

[Hook]
You gon' just sit here and waste my time like that
Like I'm fine with that; fuck yo attitude
You should roll this weed and let your mind relax
Take yo time with that; fuck yo attitude
You gon' just sit here and waste my time like that
Like I'm fine with that; fuck yo attitude
You should roll this weed and let your mind relax
Take yo time with that; fuck yo attitude
