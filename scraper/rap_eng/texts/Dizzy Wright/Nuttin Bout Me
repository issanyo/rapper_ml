[Hook: ]
Nigga you don't know nothing 'bout nothing
Nigga you don't know shit about me (you don't know shit about me)
Nigga you don't know nothing 'bout nothing
Nigga you don't know shit about me  (you don't know shit about me)
Nigga you don't know nothing 'bout nothing
Nigga you don't know shit about me  (you don't know shit about me)
Nigga you don't know nothing 'bout nothing (nothing 'bout nothing)
Nigga you don't know nothing 'bout nothing (nothing 'bout nothing)
Can't take shit personal so I don't take shit personal (take shit personal)
Can't take shit personal so I don't take shit personal (take shit personal)
Can't take shit personal so I don't take shit personal (take shit personal)
Can't take shit personal so I don't take shit personal (take shit personal)
Can't take shit personal so I don't take shit personal (take shit personal)
Cause you don't know nothing 'bout me
Right

[Verse 1: ]
I came in this world on my own and I promise I'm probably gon' leave here alone
Xhaiden my only concern she gonna learn how daddy turn up to a song
She hate when I leave and I'm gone so I gotta make time to FaceTime on the phone
Keep them happy roots and I'm not acting cute do what I have to do to stay strong
So when they hate I just smile about it, keep the Mary Jane around
I go wild without it (that's right)
Look, fuck what you think about me
Ain't no reason walk around like I'm down about
Cause growing up I don't feel the same
And I don't know how everyone else deals with lames
I look at you while you reveal my name
Shout out to Big Will and Dame
We finna kill the game

[Verse 2: ]
My city depending on me
I don't talk that shit just to defend my beliefs
You create your conflicts for the streets
And I knock the nonsense cause we praying for keeps
Grab some weed, grab my engineer, hit the studio
And tell that nigga that we staying for weeks
My album on the way nigga get ready
I feel like the rap game waiting on me
Hustle hard is a run the distance
Praying for my little brother with a son that listen
My mind lives on more than one dimension
It's a problem not a issue, you gon' learn the difference
Whatever my nigga I'm solid
I'm kicking back kicking my knowledge
We bounce like hydraulics (bounce bounce bounce)
Give it to them while they knowledge
So they can accept and allow it
Everybody want to be on
Couldn't find another me with a drone
You can try all you want, fly in the sky all you want
Taking blunts to the dome
Paying four double O for an ounce with the bro
Making sure the family tree stay strong
Cause when them branches stop falling
These niggas start renting it and talking and acting like hoes
Don't act like these hoes
I ain't afraid of no man
That's not how I'm programmed
Can I get more grams?
Just marijuana, no Lindsay Lohan
But you don't know them
Look there I go passing judgement
I ain't perfect we can add adjustments
You mad for nothing
Bad for business, laughing at you, because you niggas making bad assumptions
But anyway
