[Verse 1 G-Fresh]

All I hear is witty ignorance
I just want intelligence
So sharpin' up your cleverness
The talkin' all irrelevant
Something in the room
And that something is elephant
Metaphorically speaking lets talk about how you're full of it
Like how you always party and your moneys open ended
How you're targeting the children with your alcoholic message
And you never really fight you're just trying to sell some records
And the women that you had say they never got the message
Whoa hold on a second I just need to catch my breath to continue my lesson
Pay attention if you let the lyrics bite homie you will get infected with that main steam bug
Staying dormant for the session
Wheres your argument I don't care who started it
Just have a good reason accepting you played you part in this
I'm offering something that should be buried in your consciousness
But when the money comes a lot of people get lost in it

[Chorus G-Fresh]

HUSH
Shut your mouth for a minute
I'mma let you spit it right after I finish (if you all would please)
Shut up and listen x4
MAN
I don't think you get it
I've been tell you to shhhhh (Do me a favor and)
Shut up and listen x4

[Verse 2 Dizzy Wright]

(Yup, Yup)
I hear these fuck niggas
Teaching niggas the wrong shit
I don't know whats right
But I can take you down a long list
Brother Dizzy in the house
Lower your tone kids
Can when I speak they don't bleep
They know that I teach
I put niggas on blast faster then fast
I'm after that ass like
I'm in the club and buffy the butt just fucking past (damn)
This cash in my bag will probably end friendships
This hash in the wrap make everything stand still
I'm observer I've caught on to what they doing
They moving but they ain't moving
He bruises got her out choosing mann
Shut up and listen
Listen and shut up
All in your face and you can feel the pressure nigga!

[Chorus G-Fresh]

HUSH
Shut your mouth for a minute
I'mma let you spit it right after I finish (if you all would please)
Shut up and listen x4
MAN
I don't think you get it
I've been tell you to shhhhh (Do me a favor and)
Shut up and listen x4

[Verse 3 G-Fresh]

See I can do it like you
I just don't because I won't
The homie choose not too
There is message in the song and heres a clue
I can do anything and second verse is just the proof
I'm serial killer spitter and advocate of the truth
So if that ain't what you do hump a clone without the lobe
Got the hunger of lion
But I can not see the food
So I'm only going ham to satisfy when I chew
Why you screaming like swollen
Oops I think its broken
And I'm talking bout the link between the people and the public
I know you love it the way the man buzzin'
Like a skateboard haters you can all pop shove it

[Chorus G-Fresh]

HUSH
Shut your mouth for a minute
I'mma let you spit it right after I finish (if you all would please)
Shut up and listen x4
MAN
I don't think you get it
I've been tell you to shhhhh (Do me a favor and)
Shut up and listen x4
