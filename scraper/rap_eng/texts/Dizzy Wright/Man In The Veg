Where we at?
Who is they?
Why we here?
Fuck the game it's my time of year
I'm finally here and I'm taking off
West coast nigga I done payed the cost
Las Vegas don' made a boss
2012 and I'm good as hell
I got the fans and I can shake it off
All I need is my weed
Everything else for my seed
Not for me, so when we collab, you can understand why it's not for free
Work for it don't talk about it
Stay low key nigga that's why I been a threat
Y'all perform at everything
Only see me on the internet
I come around when I come in town
Pay homage or dumb me down
I run the town with this music shit
Underground to a hundred thou'
Blueprint my shoeprint all fail to be where the fuck I'm at
Fuck yo rap, I put my city on the fucking map
Nigga fuck with that
Young nigga with an old soul
Made it out trynna make it home
I knew it wouldn't take me long
My inspiration was Krayzie Bone
Slim Shady with the crazy tone
Guarantee I'm the hardest out
I started out trynna talk it out
Let me tell y'all what that's all about, hold up

Playin' hard, A and R's, reaching out
7:02 I'm sneaking out
Sign on I'm eating now
Now niggas want my meal
In the front with the front on kill
Record labels trynna sign me to a demo deal
FV finna run up hill so I asked
What can you do for me that we can't do for ourself?
And if you look like a major, then why we need a major help?
Y'all niggas played yourself trynna change who the fuck I be
Now here I am, and still I stand
As the motherfuckin' man in the V-E-G
So I said
What can you do for me that we can't do for ourself?
And if you look like a major, then why we need a major help?
Y'all niggas played yourself trynna change who the fuck I be
Now here I am, and still I stand
As the motherfuckin' man in the V-E-G
