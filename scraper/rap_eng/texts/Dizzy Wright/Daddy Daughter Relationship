Welcome. Alright

This is where the magic goes down
Oh
And this here booth. You know what the booth is?
Nuh-uh
The booth is where we record our vocals. You know how you hear daddy's songs?
Yeah (yeah)

[Verse 1]
You create your own glow
But we can't force the grow
Don't care about what they think baby you got this under control
You take on life and I watch, growing up and I accept that
This kind of love don't stop, we need each other but how can I stress that?
There's some things in life, that won't be right and won't add up
But don't try to be what they like, we all have bad days and bad luck
But don't forget you can call on your old man, don't forget you can call on your old man
I'm here whenever you need me, through hard times everythings gonna be all fine
Cause you got me and I got you, you always got my love
But loving yourself against the universe is what I wanna give to you
Everything I did for me I built for you (I built for you)

[Hook]
If this world ever breaks you down
Baby girl stay strong, remember that I got yo back (yo back)
No you don't gotta fight the world on your own (your own)
Man there's nothing like a daddy daughter relationship
I love you endlessly, you got a friend in me
Man there's nothing like a daddy daughter relationship
Don't be afraid to talk to me, you can always call on me
There's nothing like a daddy daughter relationship
I love you endlessly, you got a friend in me
No there's nothing like a daddy daughter relationship
Don't be afraid to talk to me, you can always call on me
