He's so oblivious to life now
Happiness was in his past, he's living in the right now
Pipe down little flies keep buzzin'
Thinking that you lovin' Bitch you know he's only fuckin'
At the end of discussions is the start of destruction
And after the reaper comes We weep on the repercussions
Isn't it something he's leading the mislead
Teaching the manuscript, bitch you thought it was dead
You're living life with no empathy
When i empty the clip in you bitch
Is when you finally beg for my sympathy
Never given im sitting on something Dizzy
My city its never busy so piggies they wanna get me
Hating when I roll up
Not talking bout that potent drug
Im talking bout my motor
Fuck the cost panties always seem to drop
When the kids pulling up clean in that dull exhaust
Hop out smell the medicine never had a Letterman
All about the Bens in the end fuck a president
And his government covering up what the public needs to see
I'm losing all hope Im giving up on society

(Talks Shit)

Coming up gradual Im the admiral
Spliffys packed in my satchel
Lassos across the last two rappers who wanted battle
Im a shadow, yall sneaky eve's given Adam the apple
When Adam's apples destruct when I speak my lyrical chatter
Straight disaster, and after he's deemed as a solid rapper
I'll be ahead in the chapter where all this rap is for laughter
I'm lifted like the rapture, posted up with some stature
Deliver the rawest lines you couldn't CAP in a caption
(Ha) Yeah you thought that you was hot huh?
(Huh?) Till I popped up, gonna make it watch us
Get these girlys topless cause every bar I make progress
Edible beats Im fondest the vigilante to congresss
Im the strongest lighting heavy green
I'm bringing in much attention while letting out my steam
And your dream supremacy's evident to everything
Cruising with all our music our movements barely seen
Nigga....

Greatly awaken prepare for the most
This polished poet read my lyrics and learn from the quotes
Cherish blessings that you inherit you smart as you grow
Swallow your spit and follow your goals
You can hide behind your background cause them dark shades is tented
Feelings finished now its the beginning of a new beginning
Who's the victim the one that feels it's all or nothing
Or the retarded successful nigga with the karma coming
Ah damn there them looks go stale face
Male female pussy you just a cell mate
You can't change your complexion we are who we are
Suspicious to your direction take advantage of the law
And the law take advantage of they jobs
And its obvious we shouldn't give authority and power to the frauds
The police ain't no different than we are
They confiscate the marijuana just so they can tuck it in their draws
We're all under god that's a problem we fear
You want the real, I heard it was my time of the year
When time collapse you won't be finding me here
And that's a promise pop it partner pay attention to the progress
Uhh..
