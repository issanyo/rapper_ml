[Verse 1:]
I'm so motivated
My motivation is putting on Vegas
But I keep exposing Satan
I don't know if I'mma make it
Cause I've been patiently waiting for my break to hit these stations
I'm constantly chasing something that is not promised
I ain't showing no love you wack rappers make me vomit
I've been puttin on for years and ain't nobody show me homage
So I refuse to show another nigga that he got it
Better work for what you want
Cause if you don't it could be taken
Vacant
Everybody wanna rap nobody want an education
What the fuck is going on?
Where the fuck did we go wrong?
These record labels signing niggas who can't even write songs
I'm pissed off bitches on my dick but shit my dick soft
Cause the way you carry yourself got me ticked off
I ain't tryin to be Rick Ross
I ain't tryin to be Gucci
I'm strugglin'
Bitch I'm ridin' round in a hoopty
So in less you bout to help me wit my music bitch don't do me
Cause I'm fooly and you starving in my motherfuckin' movie
I'm truly underrated
I'm about to let them have it
If I started exposing rappers I would probably start disasters
So I keep it cool
Say you got the juice but nigga let me speak the truth
Pac wouldn't give you the juice if he spent the week witchu
All the weakest dudes making all the givin' so we should respect the shit they spittin'?
Nigga please

[Hook:]
I'm so motivated
My motivation is putting on Vegas
I'm so motivated
My motivation is putting on Vegas

[Verse 2:]
I'm so motivated
I'm underrated and hated by niggas that I was raised wit
I'm still on the East Side of Las Vegas
Still repping Flashy Inc. still doing all the same shit
Niggas say I ain't shit, actin gay about it
Cause they dream about this
And I pray about it
So you could be bout it bout it and I'm gonna be out in counters
Accountants countants wildin while you at home loungin
That's the difference between me and you and your scene
This the life that I live and you trying to make this yo dream
My whole team standing behind me
Nobody gon' design me
So support me like Puffy did for Biggie back in the 90's
Finally I make the message but I had to go the distance
I don't need you to be hype
I just need your fucking attention
Bad decisions was given to my living
I ain't ask for this
I'm mad as shit
Cause I know we struggle by an accident
My mama wanted better
But she only wanted cheddar
So her and her kids can have everything they wanted forever
So I don't blame her but I'm filled with so much anger
Lyrics filled with so much passion expressing myself to strangers
I'm in danger cause I'm spillin out my soul
These record labels signing niggas they know that they can control
The Wright Road I'm hoping that you blow... shit
So I'm praying God open up a door
I'm motivated

[Hook:]
I'm so motivated
My motivation is putting on Vegas
I'm so motivated
My motivation is putting on Vegas
