[Hook: Demrick]
We smokin' loud with the clouds up above us
To the day that I'm layin' in my grave only God he can judge us
This life is a bitch so you might as well fuck her
Let my story read, I lived how I wanted
And yeah they gon' love it

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I wake up and bake up and ask God is he gon' wash me from all of my sins
Drinking this Henn' every night gon' fuck me up one day, I just hope I don't fall for the trends
But I got my own style from the clouds flown down, zoned out, boy she rapping
Put the song out, get onstage just to get offstage and get domed out
Pretty little thing, Rastafari' she claim, got out school and we changed
Don't worry about what they sayin', they just say what they say but they the ones paying
We just paint the artwork, they can judge the product but not the hard work
They don't see what we see behind the scenes so we focus and meditate on how to breathe
Now I'm baby momma drama free with the economy the future's bright
So I push my folks to be motivated, respect your life and catch some flights
We got moves to make, who moving with me, inhale the smoke until the truth is in me
Pick your battles and who you choose to envy, no matter who's against me

[Hook: Demrick]
We smokin' loud with the clouds up above us
To the day that I'm layin' in my grave only God he can judge us
This life is a bitch so you might as well fuck her
Let my story read, I lived how I wanted
And yeah they gon' love it
We smokin' loud with the clouds up above us
To the day that I'm layin' in my grave only God he can judge us
This life is a bitch so you might as well fuck her
Let my story read, I lived how I wanted
And yeah they gon' love it

[Verse 2: Demrick]
I’m just tryna survive, no lie, hustle till I’m multi
Momma can I get the chocha, throw it to the vultures, show no love and you know why
I can't see it no other way, light me a J, live for the day
Fuck what they say because tomorrow's not promised, I'm not Nostradamus, look what I've accomplished
I'm paving my way, back against a wall, I guess I'm looking for a way out
Hotbox in the spot, get baked out, haters watching my moves like a stakeout
Eat the pussy like takeout, know she gon' love that, fifth of Hennessey and weed, where the buzz at
But I don't do much else, I got everything in this world but help
And I never had a plan B, I did this for my family's sakes
Fuck the Grammy awards, just put me on tour with some floorspace, let me get my story straight
I got a lot to say and just a little time left, my mind said it's a lot to digest
Demrick from outta the projects, I got one question nigga, are you high yet?

[Hook: Demrick]
We smokin' loud with the clouds up above us
To the day that I'm layin' in my grave only God he can judge us
This life is a bitch so you might as well fuck her
Let my story read, I lived how I wanted
And yeah they gon' love it
