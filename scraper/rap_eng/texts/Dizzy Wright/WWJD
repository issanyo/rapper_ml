[Hook: Suspect]
I praise God from the am to the pm
If Jesus had a Twitter, you can never send a DM
Embracing all these angels and I’m shaking off these demons
You gotta learn to follow to become a successful leader
(2X)

[Verse 1: Suspect]
Intoxicated since Mama water broke
Watching n*ggas with bread while we ain’t got a loaf
That’s why that flashy shit for me is kinda hard to post
I done came up from nothing, I guess we call it growth
I ain’t write it or recite it but I saw the oath
I seen a n*gga with Heisman status start to smoke
I seen my people gettin’ sprayed so we all can vote
And do my dirt all by my lonely, don’t involve my folks
Your pen and pad game is like Trinidad James
You Reynolds with the pencil, b*tch I’m in the fast lane
N*ggas switching dressing different when the bigger cash came
The truth is my opinion, got me kickin’ facts man
I always rep the turf, aka that small grass
Hard knocks alumni, never used a hall pass
You repetitive as simpson in detention we ton chalk that
Deployed right after boot camp—these authentic dog tags

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
See, I was project living, staying away from dirty women
Triflin’ n*gga, writin’ rhymes in my dirty kitchen
Mama at work and we workin’ on how we schemin’
These n*ggas thuggin’ so sh*t, we was hustlin’ for a reason
We kept it, I wasn’t selfish
I was gunned down for my necklace
And then I became a savage and now my habits make me reckless
Catchin’ seconds
My protection was always keep a weapon
They try to rob me again, imma send them n*ggas a message
(Let ‘em have it)
And then he got indicted for the violence
We was runnin’
He got caught
I’m just hoping that he stay silent
(Real n*gga, huh)
He had that workers doin’ time, and bein’ quiet
Paranoid, I wonder if that n*gga hidin’ or he ridin’
(Let me know)
I got my thoughts together, virus to computers
(Man I hid)
Defeating myself, smoking, contemplating my future
Learning from my mistakes
Took my ways and made a way
Found my connection with God so He protect me through the day

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Suspect]
I broke the mold when I hit the soil
Don’t trust a soul, traffic court, gotta get a lawyer
When from shrimp Top Ramen to fillin’ up on oysters
Went from Instagram likes to autographing posters
Lookin’ at my schedule
I got a busy night
Don’t feel your presence, you ain’t comin’ down the chimney right
Lookin’ at my dogs brawl, it’s a frizbee fight
If it’s beef, I Hopsin like Dizzy Wright
I am Stephen Segaul
I am hard to kill
They stealin’ recipes
So I guard my grill
Lookin’ up to me, I know how a sergeant feel
I got the juice protecting Pac so they call me steal
I got these bars comin out my sweat glands
Married to the game
I’m not the best man
They tryna get the cheat sheet out this exam
I ball hard lookin’ better in my sweat pants
