[Dizzy Wright]
Yo, yo, swi-swi-swi, SwizZzleFish
Let's get 'em, lets get 'em
Let's fuckin get em, let's get em
Uh

[Hook: Dizzy Wright] x2
Who's bringing the flavor to your ear
Which one of you ladies gon make it disappear (disappear)
Who got the ganja? Know me, me time’s near (times near)
You niggas had a chance now we're taking it from here
Funk Volume (volume, volume)

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Somebody should’ve told ‘em I was next
The nigga disrespected, I had to hold him by his neck
Sometimes these niggas need to be put in check
See, sometimes these niggas can’t comprehend respect
They say I’m out of line, but you niggas is not around
How you scorin’ points when you standin’ out of bounds?
In other words, how you gettin’ money and you ain’t keeping it real?
With no skills, playin’ the field like you not a clown
I guess somebody should put the target on the fans
Support the bullshit and you a part of the scam
The million-man march, my grandaddy sellin’ grams
Learned the game from a pimp (he just becoming a man, goddamn)
Tattoo's all over my dark skin (my dark skin)
I ain't trippin I'm building on small wins
I know myself, so I told myself I'm all in
For the record and the cars we just evolving (woo-haa)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
ZZz'ed up!
Look
It's no coincidence they nervous when they see us comin'
I'll kick down your door and put an end to your fuckin' function
I ain't tryna make friends with all these rap niggas (nahh)
I rather get tea-bagged on top of cat-litter (wauw)
The only thing I fear is idle time…
So I’m back on my grizzly with the Valley state of mind
I put my all into this motherfuckin’ game…
And learn from every loss, so when I lose, it’s still a gain
Dizzy, these fools are lame – it’s obvious, but it’s unaddressed
It's sad the fans got accustomed to accepting less
I can see the clear picture even from the upper decks
So I dumb it down to make it easy for these fools to connect
We’re bringin’ that funky flavor, that new major
F-U-N-K V-O-L-U-M-E spells danger
To all you pussy footing rappers come and hear me out
FV is that clique (clique)
Something like a mouse (aha-ha-haaaaa)

[Hook]
