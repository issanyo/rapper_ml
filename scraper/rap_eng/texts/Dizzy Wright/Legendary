I don’t think niggas was listening
Shit, when Pac tried to warn us
Tell us how these Government niggas was always on us
People say they real but they don't keep it 100
And they say the world ending but they still building bunkers
2012s coming and everybody's nervous
But I swear the government did that bullshit on purpose
Puttin’ movies out. Scarin’ us, not really preparin’ us
And none of our idols don’t really care enough
To say shit So we just a fucked up generation
So much technology, but bad communication
Education’s lacking, school is a fashion show
Girls selling they body just so they stack some dough
Damn. See we don't got a fucking message
The shit that we promote is being 16 and pregnant
And the more that we promote it, the more it goes in motion
And these 16 year old's want to get on T.V just to show it
Were hopeless, but as the oldest I'mma spend weeks on it
Dedicate my life just so you can hear me speak on it
Some say I'm tripin', some say I'm the bravest
Mind like 2Pac, and he died in Las Vegas
He left the torch to me to talk to the youngins
To tell you we can't feel, we can't keep running
Stand up with some balls
Stand up to the people who just wanna see us fall
And when we don't will they applaud? Nah
Cause they just want to see you when you at your worst
And they rather us do dirt than really work for what we're worth
Man I swear this shit hurts, they killin' our children
Cause they ain't really livin', cause they think the world endin'
Respect is at it's lowest, and older people playin' us
Cause back in the day people actually gave a fuck
We didn't luck up with a 2Pac Shakur
All we got is rappers throwin’ money that make us want more
Damn, Illuminati gettin’ to these niggas
That’s why I’m with my niggas stayin’ distant from these niggas
Listen to a nigga, they out here clappin’ people
This big-chain-big-money-shit distractin’ people
When we got a black president, and yeah that’s a fact
But half of ya'll voted knowing that president was black
‘Cause people didn’t care, if he could change instantly
They just wanted to say that blacks made history
To prove these white people wrong, like it’s a blessin’
Its 2011 and we still in a recession
‘Cause Barack Obama, can’t do it by his self
And I don’t see nobody tryna help
It's killing my soul knowing my daughter gotta be born into this hell
How she suppose to enjoy life if it's over in 2012
Nah fuck that, I ain’t ‘bout to feed her that nonsense
I ain’t ‘bout to believe in that nonsense
Nigga I’m a problem
