[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
Uh, I'm doing this because I know I can
Uh

[Hook x2]
I love weed, weed, weed, weed
Weed I do adore
I got my Wiz Khalifa paper with some bomb from my neighbors
I'm high I hope you high off yours (Hold up)

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
(Inhale this) and relax your mind
Grind all of your weed and recline it's about that time
Black hippy like a Top Dawg
Hot boxing the hot wheels just me and 1 no it's not hot sauce
I'm feeling good how 'bout you my nigga?
If you ain't trying to go up then you need to move, my nigga
And I ain't trying to be rude but shit we trying to get high
And you fucking up my groove
See, see I be on my own shit, most of the time
Smoking by my lonely, really trying to ease my mind
Reclining in my caddy, probably bumping Soul Searchin'
You say I smoke too much well motherfucker whats your purpose
Uh, Don't get me out of my character
I'm about to hit this Badu like Erykah
Black america, I be the one to smoke Obama out
Get the munchies and we at yo' mama house

[Hook x2]
I love weed, weed, weed, weed
Weed I do adore
I got my Wiz Khalifa paper with some bomb from my neighbors
I'm high I hope you high off yours (Hold up)

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Uh, You can try to say it slow you down
But basically I'mma tell you, you can suck a dick
Cus I been smoking this weed it be like mission complete
Keep it G my team is still running shit
Las Vegas with some growers
Trying to stay strong still searching for some closure
It ain't over til' it's over
I'm a Jehova soldier, I just happen to be a smoker
Fuck face, I'm rolling something thats plus size
I hit the doobie not woozy nigga I'm dumb high
So come by my high will keep you far away
In other words my range is Tim Hardaway
Your little blunts do not scare us
The way I smoke, I'm Snoop Dogg with a hair cut
But don't compare us I am the D-I-Z
So when you speaking to me
Let the motherfuckers know...

[Hook x2]
I love weed, weed, weed, weed
Weed I do adore
I got my Wiz Khalifa paper with some bomb from my neighbors
I'm high I hope you high off yours (Hold up)

Verse 3
Cool tank on E, but I got three
I'mma bring the Swishers, and I'll provide the weed
Slide in, lookin' like the greatest
Shout out to my nigga Diz, cause it's lookin like he made it
Young niggas grinding, trying to stay above the haters
Told em keep going hard cause I feel like it's contagious
And we smoke proper we keep the weed partner
Rolled up in broke the blunt
Had to see the weed doctor
I ain't Wiz Khalifa
But I be high though
Blowing windy city smoking on Chicago
We be motivated to get it
Cargos, polo laid back with a fitted
Low key cause too many can't understand
How someone born with nothing can
Crawl out the sand
Give it all he can
Be his own man
I sit and reminisce with this blunt in my hand
So fuck your opinion, just keep the tree spinnin'
And go and get atrophy, cause nigga we winning
Tell Breeze get some bad bitches
Let him come up in the booth and do some ad libbing
Hey I kill tracks
I'm ill, I'm a chill cat
The rhythm you feel that we some bad niggas
Uhh I swear trees keep my mind right
Cause tryin to go against the world is a long fight
Long nights in the studio grinding
Working double shifts forget about the timing
Shit, trying to be great and stay above hate
I'm happy all I gotta do is puff to escape
And my cool shit you know what I need
Roll up cause I love weed
