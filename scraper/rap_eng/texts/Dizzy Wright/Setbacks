[Chorus: Oktane]
Flexin' on the squad, you'll regret that
We done came up through the setbacks
Supercharged up, that's a jetpack
We the ones who charge, where the checks at?
Flexin' on the squad, you'll regret that
We done came up through the setbacks
Supercharged up, that's a jetpack
We the ones who charge, where the checks at?

[Verse 1: Price]
We got 'em anticipatin', it's like the First Comin'
Gettin' rich for the kids, oh now you worth somethin'
You feel this in your spirits, make you think Kirk comin'
Yeah, I'm all about Franklins, I'm never complacent

[Verse 2: Oktane]
When you come from the pavement, nothin' can faze you
That's why we up hella late, full concentration
You'll step and levitation, that's an arrangement
3-man weave to the banger, fuckin' amazin'

[Verse 3: Demrick]
Pay like you wait for these rainy days that we live through
Went from hoppin' out the rental to smokin' out every venue
Two hands high in the sky, yeah that's essential
Show love for this food for your soul, that's on the menu

[Chorus: Oktane]
Flexing on the squad, you'll regret that
We done came up through the setbacks
Supercharged up, that's a jetpack
We the ones who charge, where the checks at?
Flexing on the squad, you'll regret that
We done came up through the setbacks
Supercharged up, that's a jetpack
We the ones who charge, where the checks at?

[Verse 4: Dizzy Wright]
I see how the government continue playing these games
Make us felons, that's a systematic slavery chain
Eatin' all that Raisin' Canes ain't gonna gain you a thang
Slowin' you down, don't you think that that's a random exchange

[Verse 5: Emilio Rojas]
Yeah, di-di-da-di-di-di-da-di-da
Them cats ain't detoxin', all them rappers Dr. Dre
They leanin' and they poppin' them pills and blowing H
Goin' crazy 'fore they get to blow up, they blow away

[Verse 6: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, they throwaways, these niggas should know your place
Made it through some setbacks, the god, that's no debate
And I don't fuck with squares, you fraud, we know you fake
Out here singin' to the opps, that's odd, we don't relate nigga

[Verse 7: Reezy]
Aye, block of gold in the safe, been on some other shit
Melanated like being the cooper mother shit
Alien to the bullshit, that's Space Jam
MJ to the setback, where the checks at?

[Chorus: Oktane]
Flexin' on the squad, you'll regret that
We done came up through the setbacks
Supercharged up, that's a jetpack
We the ones who charge, where the checks at?
Flexin' on the squad, you'll regret that
We done came up through the setbacks
Supercharged up, that's a jetpack
We the ones who charge, where the checks at?
