[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Lauryn Hill's soul flowin' through my pen (yeah)
How you gon' win, if you ain't right within? (word)
How you gon' win, if you ain't right within? (within)
The devil is the man that tried to right the sins (talk to 'em)
Lauryn Hill's soul flowin' through my pen (yeah)
How you gon' win, if you ain't right within? (word)
How you gon' win, if you ain't right within? (within)
The devil is the man that tried to right the sins

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
So, I hit 'em with this purpose and this passion
It's hits in catalogs and my shit soundin' everlastin'
My flows is bottomless, that's unlimited with every basket
These days, you can only preach religion if you on acid
Ask your pastor 'bout the shit that he be passin'
They teach false Greek philosophies in college classes
That's the reason we rock number 7 like Colin Kaepernick
We on y'all asses, tried to burn our history to ashes
Hold on, we the chosen ones, let me talk
I made sure that I would have somethin' to say to y'all
Protest peace, take a knee for justice and they chase you off
Y'all read The New Jim Crow, we don't even got to break the law
We're the new activists, I got a lot to say
Screamin' Black Power and I'm proud of my Rasta ways
The Black man, with a cost, no, don't hit him with it
Even though they did us dirty and we're still livin' with it
I'm trying to make this thing like a nipple piercing
Breakin' down doors, like fuck what I'm interfering
Fuck any nigga that secretly work for the Willie Lynch's
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and you
Workin' day and night for my kids, that's why I'm casually gone
Black man, be better fathers, don't be absent from home
I'm workin' day and night, always trying to be a better man
But the policeman don't think that's what I'm actually on
Locked away like a slave, they only killin' our mindsets
In an age of color-blindness, I tried to kill 'em with kindness
It worked until it didn't
How I'm s'posed to feel when I see
All these Black and Brown convictions, lookin' like a color convention
We out here trying to fight a system that's workin' against us
Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?
Every day I ask myself this question
What more do you want from me?

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Lauryn Hill's soul flowin' through my pen (yeah)
How you gon' win, if you ain't right within? (word)
How you gon' win, if you ain't right within? (within)
The devil is the man that tried to right the sins (talk to 'em)
Lauryn Hill's soul flowin' through my pen (yeah)
How you gon' win, if you ain't right within? (word)
How you gon' win, if you ain't right within? (within)
The devil is the man that tried to right the sins

[Verse 2: Ille Camille]
Ancestors speakin' through me, that's why I'm brave
I got Harriet genetics, Motherland in me
Just a queen in this thing with a message to bring
The apple never falls far, so what's the fruit without trees?
What's the trees without roots, we all connected like limbs
If real recognize real, I got a soul like a hymn
Back to more important matters, like love and Black lives
They tried to keep us in the hole, like balls in the back nine
But see it's power in numbers, I ain't talkin' the minutes
The 15 don't apply until we walk in the spirit
That's why we're here, the plan is really simple assignments
The Almighty behind me, got Dizzy Wright to the left of me
Man and woman alignment, we be in sync like Justin and them
We push on and go forward like gusts in the wind
The 8th wonder's really us, let me give you the proof
If what I'm sayin' ain't the truth, then tell me the use
Of them killin' our youth, our rights, our sons and our daughters
Our patriarchs and our mamas
That's a question that you got to ask yourself
But always know that God's people prevail, weather's forever fail
Long as we can inhale, yeah it's Heaven wherever we at
When the final hour comes, I pray your hearts are intact
Forgive them Father, when it hurts so bad
We all lost a couple ones, but stay on your path, my nigga

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Lauryn Hill's soul flowin' through my pen (yeah)
How you gon' win, if you ain't right within? (word)
How you gon' win, if you ain't right within? (within)
The devil is the man that tried to right the sins (talk to 'em)
Lauryn Hill's soul flowin' through my pen (yeah)
How you gon' win, if you ain't right within? (word)
How you gon' win, if you ain't right within? (within)
The devil is the man that tried to right the sins
