K-K-Kato on the track bitch

[Chorus: Don Rich]
This world will weigh you down
But you'll make a way around
Your vibes will keep all the clowns away
Watch the throne, don't let 'em take the crown
When it get rough, keep your head up
Gotta kill the clubs, get your bread up
Gotta feel the vibe and get your wave up
Gotta ride the wave just to stay up
Get way up, way up
(Way up, way up, way up, way up)
Way up, way up
Way up, way up
Way up, way up

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Don't waste no time
Keep going hard everyday, everything'll be fine
Stay away from jail cause they tryna control our minds
If somebody told your pussy is better than please stay line
I know what I want
Ayy shout out to all my niggas that's rocking their aunts
I pray y'all get it in for the whole 12 months
You gotta go hard when they don't wanna see you stunt

[Chorus: Don Rich]
This world will weigh you down
But you'll make a way around
Your vibes will keep all the clowns away
Watch the throne, don't let 'em take the crown
When it get rough, keep your head up
Gotta kill the clubs, get your bread up
Gotta feel the vibe and get your wave up
Gotta ride the wave just to stay up
Get way up, way up
(Way up, way up, way up, way up)
Way up, way up
Way up, way up
Way up, way up

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
I done gave y'all the flavor
We go way up and stay up
I'm all alone, it's a layup
Your full court press couldn't play us
Blowing niggas out ain't fair enough
Watch the neighborhoods that you tearing up
Getting to the bag, he don't care enough
Like don't be childish, this America
Stepping out just to act arrogant
Just to stunt on niggas that don't ever win
I can't fuck with it, I can't fuck with it
Learn about that debt while you up spending
In and up with it,, pulling up like what up with it
They gon' interrogate us
I see niggas vibrating hella low
But they celebrating oh for sure, for sure

[Chorus: Don Rich]
This world will weigh you down
But you'll make a way around
Your vibes will keep all the clowns away
Watch the throne, don't let 'em take the crown
When it get rough, keep your head up
Gotta kill the clubs, get your bread up
Gotta feel the vibe and get your wave up
Gotta ride the wave just to stay up
Get way up, way up
(Way up, way up, way up, way up)
Way up, way up
Way up, way up
Way up, way up
