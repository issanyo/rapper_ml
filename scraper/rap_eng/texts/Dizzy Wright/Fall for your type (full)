Uh, she think like a man, but act like a lady
She got her own apartment, and she drives a Mercedes
The type of shit that make me wanna get together
But I know I ain’t shit, and she got her shit together
See , i act like its what ever 'cus i wanted to be forever
But I know that I’m not proving that I’m something to be treasured
So i down myself daily, makin' myself feel worthless
See perfect men ain't real and real men ain't perfect
See the person that I am, in the mirror
Is not the same person that I am, when you here
See its hard to be yourself when you require so much more
And they say if she can't accept you need to let her go
But love can leave you blind
Rewind back all the visions
To the first time ya’ll kicked
And you thought it was it
See this is what i think of
When she who i would think of
When she who i would call
Just to lay down and dream of
I need love
And i know that's bad
But I’ve always been the single type
'cus even when we doin' great i think about the single life
Why? 'cus now we frustrated workin' shit out
'cus i get in , and i be lookin' for excuses just to get out

Damn…

They say anything that you truly want, is worth fighting for
But the more you fight, you lose sight of what you fighting for
The fight begins to get old, and now I’m just losing faith
And I got so much build up that I can’t even communicate
Now we not talking, ‘cause she just think I’m full of shit
And now I’m easily irritated off little shit
Just for a lil' bit
If i could take a visit to back where we went wrong
I swear i wouldn't fix it
'cus no man should ever have to deal wit the shit i deal wit
So when you asked to kick it i would probably say
“I’m busy"
Damn, fuck my problems as i blaze one
But the worst mistake you make is when you're too afraid to make one
So i pray more and i try to hold my head
And the only words i regret are the one i never said
I always fall for your type and I just don’t understand
But I just don’t wanna see the day you got another man

I’ll be damned.. Uh
