How do you want it baby
You want to hit a blunt, or hit a joint, or hit a bong, and take a dab of what you want, what you want
How do you want it baby
I want to fire it up, I'm trying to take you higher up, blaze with us and light it up, know what I'm talking about?
How do you want it baby
You want to hit a blunt, or hit a joint, or hit a bong, and take a dab of what you want, what you want
How do you want it baby

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Woke up to see my keys missing
Hope my girl's on a weed mission
We don't ever try to be different
We get high and just laugh at niggas
Most of y'all are just entertaining
Grew up here and still live in Vegas
The hometown love feels amazing, spread the love and then I get it back
Went on tour and made 50 racks, and let my momma flip it on the slot machine
Same city where Pac died, so we smoke pot with the pac vibes
Learned a lot when I was on the road
Did 30 shows with no weed problems
Good weed indeed is what we need, but we don't need drama
Blazing all the way to Canada
Book me and hit up my manager
She loving the [?] she's never smoke Reggie
Tonight I'm finna go and handle her
Tell me girl, how do you want it?
You looking so good in the dress, I'm impressed, but being a stoner's a bonus
Telling her, "You got all my respect", so I'm like (woah)

[Verse 2: Demrick]
She likes to do dabs, she love to smoke wax blunts, eating the edibles
Sex game incredible, I tell you that much, the type of ass you can't pass up
Don't bother to bag up, just bring the whole pound
Cause we burn them down to the ground, pass them around and around and around and arou-
She in a [?], I ain't surprised enjoying the high
Let's go for a ride, just let me inside, divide and conquer, and we get it live like a concert
Good weed and hard work, painting my picture like artwork
Baby your body is God's work, hold up we need to get on first
D, I like to smoke papers, Henny shots no chasers
Occasional dabber, wax or shatter, don't matter the flavor
The rig's set, low temp
Hot box, no tent
Smooth, get away with no prints
The groove's set, so tell me, "How do you want it?"
