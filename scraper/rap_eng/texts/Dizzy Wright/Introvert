I-I-ISM

[Chorus]
In and out of my zone but don't want anyone in my face
Being lonely at home but don't want anyone in my space
How you gon' boss up if you can't put anyone in their place?
Introvert, don't try to avoid these conversations
Introvert, it ain't my time you gon' be wasting
Introvert

[Verse]
Damn this my reply to you, I was excited too
You wanna go home I said yes, introvert problems I guess
Was waiting on the invitation and now you don't wanna get dressed
Trying to understand the daily struggle
Made the hustle, made the do your best
Fuck it
Girl there's some things that ain't no comment
We met at the perfect time
And I'm learning now let's be honest before you jet
She cool with it cause she know I'm kicking it accurate
Immaculate, addicted to stacking it
I'll be back for it but you know I'm...

[Chorus]
In and out of my zone but don't want anyone in my face
Being lonely at home but don't want anyone in my space
How you gon' boss up if you can't put anyone in their place?
Introvert, don't try to avoid these conversations
Introvert, it ain't my time you gon' be wasting
Introvert

[Bridge]
Overthinking, overthinking
I feel like I'm sinking
Hit you up, we linking
Overthinking, overthinking
I feel like I'm sinking
She said it's too bad I'm...

[Chorus]
In and out of my zone but don't want anyone in my face
Being lonely at home but don't want anyone in my space
How you gon' boss up if you can't put anyone in their place?
Introvert, don't try to avoid these conversations
Introvert, it ain't my time you gon' be wasting
Introvert
