[Verse 1]
She said
I guess I gotta just deal with the bullshit
You about to grab your full clip so you can go retaliate
You wanna know why I'm trippin?
Cause I don't wanna have to birth this baby on my own and have to explain why you passed away
You say, you good, like you may be home
But in my heart I know you may be wrong
I wish you understood I wouldn't agreed to a baby if you was gonna be beefing with other hoods, you trynna play me out
A negative is how you make me out but if something happened to you which one of your homies gonna help me raise this child?
We was in this together, be a man
And if they killed yo friend I know damn well they'll kill again
So don't you look at me stupid like everything's alright, it's not alright your stupidity can cost you your life
And now I'm stuck with your child, understand me
You worried about your goons and I'm worried about this family

Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)

[Verse 2]
He said
I guess I gotta just deal with the bullshit
The fact that they used a full clip to kill my fucking best friend
So why you talkin about family? I considered him family, so don't mistake this for a muthafucking Def Jam
I'm trynna tell you I'm good, but if they take me home
I pray to God that you keep my baby strong
I may be wrong trynna handle with altercation
But how can I live my life if I ran from this situation?
So I take a little vacation after my nigga got blasted
I was riding when he was riding
Now I'm supposed to be scared of a casket you ain't feelin' that?
I ain't no killa but I'm killing back
I don't give a fuck!
I'mma retaliate like I can bring my nigga back
It's war, it's not my kindness it's insanity
Take a friend of mine and now everybody's an enemy
Fuck it I gotta do it, don't lose it I know you hate this shit
But I'll be damned if they get away with this. It's on

[Hook:Chel'le]
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)

[Bridge]
Had ya pride not got in the way, I would have known just what I meant to you
Had my pride not got in the way, you would have known, just what you mean to me

[Hook:Chel'le]
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
