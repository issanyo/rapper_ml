[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Told you this that baby maky make you feel amazing mazin
When me and my baby blazing on the daily basis (on the daily basis)
On the daily basis
Told you this that baby maky make you feel amazing mazin
When me and my baby blazing on the daily basis (on the daily basis)
On the daily basis

[Verse 1: Demrick]
Yeah we gon' smoke a little weed (yeah)
Yeah we gon' drink a little henny (yeah)
When the vibe gets heavy Imma dive in 'em thighs like the tide already
I'm just trying to get your mind already
Take your time all why I get high let the ride go steady
See there's no need to rush
I roll you this J while you light up my blunt
Gave my soul to the stage
My heart to this game
With pleasure comes pain
Success it comes strain
No sense to complain (no)
Just obtain what you wish
Big bags of flavour to twist
She been down with me since the very start
A real rider mama play your part

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Told you this that baby maky make you feel amazing mazin
When me and my baby blazing on the daily basis (on the daily basis)
On the daily basis
Told you this that baby maky make you feel amazing mazin
When me and my baby blazing on the daily basis (on the daily basis)
On the daily basis

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Everybody want a little spotlight
Shit I know 'em when it's not right
So we living in a world where we all got problems but we never trynna stop life even when it's not nice
So I'm down to blaze when you stop by
Make me a part of your daily plans
Just got off tour and I'm making fans
The gentleman shake every lady hand
I was walking on crowds I'm a crazy man
The marihuana got me reminiscing I've been trying to make a living for a while
(Right now) got me sittin' here thinkin' I can get it what you feelin'
But I feel my mind evolving and one day the world will appreciate what I've offered
But for now I'm enjoying your energy, elevated girl look what you did to me

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Told you this that baby maky make you feel amazing mazin
When me and my baby blazing on the daily basis (on the daily basis)
On the daily basis
Told you this that baby maky make you feel amazing mazin
When me and my baby blazing on the daily basis (on the daily basis)
On the daily basis
Told you this that baby maky make you feel amazing mazin
When me and my baby blazing on the daily basis (on the daily basis)
On the daily basis
Told you this that baby maky make you feel amazing mazin
When me and my baby blazing on the daily basis (on the daily basis)
On the daily basis
