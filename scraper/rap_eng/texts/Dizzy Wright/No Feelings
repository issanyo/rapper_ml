[Chorus]
Me and my nigga is on some go gettas
You can catch me on the track and you know I'm going gorillas
Fuck you and your feelings I'm just chasing down the skrilla
B.H.P., FV, I'm just sayin nobody's realer
(Nobody)Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(They know) Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(They know) Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(They know) Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(Nobody)When are these niggas gonna ever get it right
Fuck you and your feelings I'ma spend it all night

[Verse 1]
B.H.P.'s the clique so fuck you and who you with
Yo we swipe like every chick so I suggest you cuff your bitch
Rappers with a side of Heat, that's my favorite dish
And my  name ain't Mr. Hanky but you know that I'm the shit
With a rock that's cocaine, never us so she hang with broke lames
You walking, I'm talking about rap shit while getting nice whips and gold chains
And Austin is the code name, Your bitch dumb, she ain't giving no brain
And she's like a photo in a wallet nigga no frame
Me, I produce flames, you can call me propane
You staying on that dashboard motherfucker you got no game
Me, yo I spit nice so hit twice got another gonna get right
You I been tight, I make about double platinums for my album got about 10 mics
Nigga I'm the next to shine probably cause I'm the best with mine
I get a workout from lifting my notebook I got heavy rhymes
FV, Heat Squad, runs deep of the Chevy lines
With beats that knock more than [?]

[Chorus]
Me and my nigga is on some go gettas
You can catch me on the track and you know I'm going gorillas
Fuck you and your feelings I'm just chasing down the skrilla
B.H.P., FV, I'm just sayin nobody's realer
(Nobody)Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(They know) Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(They know) Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(They know) Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(Nobody)When are these niggas gonna ever get it right
Fuck you and your feelings I'ma spend it all night

[Verse 2]
B.H.P. we out here, real niggas from AZ
Bad bitch in my inbox, that's everyday, no daydream
Pray to God if you play me, no AC them ARs
All black like KG and they got [?] like K-Dean
My OGs got OZs of that hard white and them green packs
That shoebox my green safe, nigga my pockets on Green Bay
50 blunts on my weed tray, bitch don't kill my vibe
We in Vegas drunk and dizzy vibing to that Dizzy Wright
I am smoking on that [?] got that swisher full of heat
Kevin Hart these niggas on the beat, night-night niggas go to sleep
Fuck you and your feelings boy, that top floor we racked out
Half rack for that verse, nigga come get this work
Riding around with a .45 and there's 4 guys and I co-sign anything they do
So when I roll by go hard, well it's gonna fly, finna hit everything inside plus you
Really I'm about my dough
B.H.P. we finna blow
Arizona finna blow
Girl, you already know

[Chorus]
Me and my nigga is on some go gettas
You can catch me on the track and you know I'm going gorillas
Fuck you and your feelings I'm just chasing down the skrilla
B.H.P., FV, I'm just sayin nobody's realer
(Nobody)Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(They know) Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(They know) Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(They know) Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(Nobody)When are these niggas gonna ever get it right
Fuck you and your feelings I'ma spend it all night

[Verse 3]-Dizzy Wright
Well I know I ain't heartless, but I ain't never been on my feelings
Yo I'm working on my forgiveness, I'm wondering if God is willing
I swear this life to God I'm building, Dizzy Wright kinda tight he killing
We show up and smoke the weed first cause Teamwork Makes The Dream Work
When I needed work, I never took time I believed it first
Niggas talk down, walk around like we wasn't on our grind out here trying to be the first
Why the fuck you wasting my time, I'm young but I gotta get mine
So I rip shows and she rip clothes off just for some of my time
I know that you thinking you got it but your biggest problem is nigga you lazy
If you don't wanna put in that work, Get out your feelings, you whack, you crazy
Maybe I should teach a class
These little niggas really need it bad
I'ma teach about life and if it's right
Then I'll teach em swag
Lose school points if you lose joints
Smoke weed no loose joints
Food for thought and you can eat this
Rapping good don't mean shit
So wherever your team is
If you don't talk about business moves
Sorry to kick this to you player
Ain't nobody gonna be into you
Dizzy Wright

[Chorus]
Me and my nigga is on some go gettas
You can catch me on the track and you know I'm going gorillas
Fuck you and your feelings I'm just chasing down the skrilla
B.H.P., FV, I'm just sayin nobody's realer
(Nobody)Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(They know) Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(They know) Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(They know) Fuck you and your feelings, boy
(Nobody)When are these niggas gonna ever get it right
Fuck you and your feelings I'ma spend it all night
