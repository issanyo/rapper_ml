[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Niggas might not like this one yeah
It's all good in the hood
We don't disrespect the game over here
Never have never will
Oh no no no yiggity yomp to the yomp yomp
Check it out

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Smoke out conversations with my dogs
We respect them niggas on the chart
But you ain't top 10 if you don't write your shit
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud
And you ain't top 10 if you don't write your shit
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
These one hit wonders buzzing while I'm strategizing
Kicking that real shit for them while they analyzing
Brodie acting like he wrote it but he didn't, woah!
Yo you should be convicted with the quickness
Get them out I been swimming used to get them out
Fuck these major labels that get these artist and pimp 'em out
Damn they always coming and going its someone different now
Look I ain't have a penny to my name and now I'm feeling proud
Like I'm holy ghosting
Look I'm a solo dolist
I hope you can over stand that we don't all come from roaches
So I hope you can tell the difference between soft and ferocious
Funny how they changed the game and weird niggas got all the focus
Wait I ain't no racist no
But this that black magic Tracy McGrady dog
That Mos Def and Talib Kweli 1980 flow
That means I'm a black star
No that just means theirs too many frauds and I can't take no more
Say no more

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Smoke out conversations with my dogs
We respect them niggas on the chart
But you ain't top 10 if you don't write your shit
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud
And you ain't top 10 if you don't write your shit
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
I won't tolerate the disrespect no more
Play me now I'm Harden with that left for sure
Feeling like I'm Busta Rhymes before he cut the dreads
On Friday's I'm cold as Ice Cube like Craig
Now I'm on your head
Aye yo quitting would be your best interest
Some of these rappers is terrible give them the death sentence
Today's the day I say fuck having a Steph image
Even though I'm golden
Man it's hard to fight for the all star voting
Clutching or closing
Hitting that 3 set button Ronnie Devoeing
And that poison still pouring
Now they want to Drake and Meek it up
I hated all ways try to use the power of the media
Doing it with no one knowing
We know you hoeing
'Cause down that road it's mandatory tryna hold on the longest
Don't need no help to tell my story maybe one day I
Can get a over rated check
But I'm just feeling like it's some things the new legends shouldn't accept

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Smoke out conversations with my dogs
We respect them niggas on the chart
But you ain't top 10 if you don't write your shit
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud
And you ain't top 10 if you don't write your shit
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud

Smoke out conversations with my dogs
We respect them niggas on the chart
But you ain't top 10 if you don't write your shit
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud
And you ain't top 10 if you don't write your shit
Don't call yourself a rapper you's a fraud
