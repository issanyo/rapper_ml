[Intro: Jarren Benton]
K-K-Kato on the track bitch

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Hit 'em with the pose, drop that, drop that
Inversion, I like that, yoga bend
I might make your knees touch your chin
Hit 'em with the pose, let it begin, keep workin'
Drop that, drop that, inversion, I like that, yoga bend
I might make your knees touch your chin
Hit 'em with the pose, let it begin, keep workin'

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Clock tickin', clock tickin', she fuck with yoga and a rock with it (rock with it)
Uh, stretch for me then, stretch for me then (oouu)
Uh, they wasn't with me now they rockin' with the kid (goddamn)
You got that workout body, you're in shape (you're in shape)
I am not easily impressed (hell nah)
Dress huggin' on to the ass like, "Why you even get dressed?"
Okay, let me play with, play with it (uh-huh)
Yoga bend for me and my pot (my pot)
She like to twerk when she do her squats (squats)
I like the fact that she like me to watch
Dressin' fancy, clean and classy, might had to kill them with perfection
Self-determent, bitch don't ask, if that's my queen, it is quick check
I'm 'bouta, work her out, fuck her everyday, never M.I.A
On my way, when you hit my line, I'll be on my way
Execute, you make me look good when I stand next to you
Ayy one fade, this that day one shit, it work like this (work like this)

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Hit 'em with the pose, drop that, drop that
Inversion, I like that, yoga bend
I might make your knees touch your chin
Hit 'em with the pose, let it begin, keep workin'
Drop that, drop that, inversion, I like that, yoga bend
I might make your knees touch your chin
Hit 'em with the pose, let it begin, keep workin'

[Bridge: Dizzy Wright]
Drop that, I like that, drop that, I like that, yoga bend, girl goddamn
Drop that, I like that, drop that, I like that, yoga bend, girl goddamn
Drop that, I like that, drop that, I like that, yoga bend

[Verse 2: Jazz Lazr]
Drop that (drop that), so high get contact (contact)

Exercise you gon' get a workout (exercise)
Bend them thighs, you gon' have to twerk now (twerk, twerk, twerk)
Big, booty Judy, tear it up like a ticket to the movie
I made a pussy wetter then I tell a uzi
I made Atlanta tippin' strippers like I'm Gucci
I'm a grow out my hair like Tunchi, young millionaire like Tunchi
My bitch bad and boujee, she on lean with Christian Loubs
She do it like cardio (ya), little like Cardi B (yeah)
When I'm Offset (Offset), ain't no stoppin' me (No)
Get on top of me (On top), yoga bend
You and your friend, that's two reps of ten

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Hit 'em with the pose, drop that, drop that

Hit 'em with the pose, let it begin, keep workin'
Drop that, drop that, inversion, I like that, yoga bend

Hit 'em with the pose, let it begin, keep workin'
