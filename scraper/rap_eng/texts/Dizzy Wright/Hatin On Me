[Verse 1]

Yeah, I feel im the shit cuz everybody talkin'
I know im the shit cause everybody watchin'
Uh,im tryna make it to the top
But the top seems far when everybody is stallin'
Yeah, young man tryna stand out
And im tryna be the best, hands down
I rep the veg so im more than just a man now
Im making doe and everybody got they hand out
Damn, yall niggas trippin'
Niggas see the money comin in and wanna kick it
And when I say im busy
All of you dickheads start saying im starting to get a big head
But im out in these streets chasin the big bread
I ain't got to start im cool with being the sixth man
I got problems, tryna mix it in with the dreams
Get money then mix it in with the teams
So whats all the hate for nigga just stop it
When its time to hate im always a topic
But I realize that niggas want attention
And its hard to ignore someone thats so poppin

[Hook]

Back up I need my space
Motherfuckers stop being so fake

And I say (holdup hold up) stop hatin on me

[Verse 2]

I'm looking in the mirror and I see fate
You lookin in the mirror and you see hate
I'm surprised your ass could even see straight
And I'mma make it the V.E.G. way
Hold up, niggas tryna jack my style
Fuck that nigga ima aim for the clouds
Sit on that bitch and then aim for your mouth
As im pissin and im dissin yellin nigga what now
Laughin, enjoying the fact you niggas hatin on me
Im never comin down, so why waitin on me
Got a child so you know theres niggas hatin on me
So shout out to all the people whos prayin for me
Yea, its kinda hard in the game
When you comin out and goin hard in the paint
Niggas on your ass tryna hawk for the same
But they talk and they hate to obtain man

[Hook]

Back up I need my space
Motherfuckers stop being so fake
Nigga please get up out my face
Quit with all of that hate
And I say (holdup hold up) stop hatin on me

[Verse 3]

See don't hate if you don't know
You just mad cuz the people seem to want more
But you should respect the fact it ain't a dumb flow
And if you don't like it well your ass can hit the front door
Yeah, 'cuz I will never put the mic down
A niggas tryna move into a nice house
Beatin up these tracks nigga I'm ike now
I might smile but who cares when the lights down
Geez, let a nigga breath
My little nigga breeze told me that these niggas is weak
As the weeks go by, a nigga move closer
The closer I get, shit, I lose closure
But I don't ever really trip, alcoholic mind set but I don't ever really sip
But all of these hits that attract all the glitz
Make it easy to live like I'm the shit

[Hook]

Back up I need my space
Motherfuckers stop being so fake
Nigga please get up out my face
Quit with all of that hate
And I say (holdup hold up) stop hatin on me
(hold up hold up), stop hatin on me
(hold up hold up) stop hatin on me
Im just tryna do my thing
