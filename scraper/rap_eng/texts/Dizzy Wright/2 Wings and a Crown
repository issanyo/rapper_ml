[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Just got an expensive pack (Yeahh)
Black Locs with the golden rims to match (Yeahh)
Nice style, yeah the Fresh Prince is back (yeahh)
2 wings and a crown is how I mix and match
I hits the wax, cloud surfin' on a cloud pen
Positive energy when you stands around him (yeahh)
Popular can't stand to see them niggas down him
Just a couple brown men tryna get some clean money (yeahh)
Oh this is life well it's alright I got this hotel for the night
But for the flight I be up all through the night
What it's like? it's cool
I be doing what I do for you
I'm in the street's 'til my feet hurt
Ayo Dizzy I got it if you ever need work
I'm goodie I got some shit that I've been working on (oh snap)
Heard it all but I feel I deserve it all (I feel ya)
I ain't trying to get all caught up in the life
Caught up in some shit that got me paying for lawyers for battles they don't wanna fight right
Keep it Dizzy right? Roll it up and live the hippy life
Even on yo' shitty night (at least he got some weed)
Yeah maintaining 'til I'm stable and comfy
Middle fangaz to the labels that want me
I'm funky if you smell me tell me, we living good in the LV

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I'm more then alright
Got a good vibe, everyday I'm celebrating life
Living fly got 2 Wings and a crown
(Living like a king now)
Nothing but love, got a good buzz
Want to give the whole wide world a hug
Living high like 2 wings and a crown

[Verse 2: Irv Da Phenom]
All I ever wanted to do
Was make the music people bob they head to
And get to moving they shoes
It's coming from the soul but I'm never singing the blues
Cause God is just too good to stop smiling
Used a lot of time of mine searching for the diamonds
'Til the day I looked up in the mirror and seen the brightest one shinin'
Iâ€™ve got a wealth some millionaires have never seen
You not on top of the world if you still in need of self-esteem
We hard looking for that feeling
The only place that you will ever get it
It's in that vessel you live in
You got approval before you even ask permission
Just decide that its finally time for you to get it
We kick it harder for the homies who got wings now
Life is short so I'm living like a king now
I'm on a high they can never ever bring down
On cloud 9 creating mean sounds.. ha

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I'm more then alright
Got a good vibe, everyday I'm celebrating life
Living fly got 2 Wings and a crown
(Living like a king now)
Nothing but love, got a good buzz
Want to give the whole wide world a hug
Living high like 2 wings and a crown

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
(Break it down)
2 wings and a crown from holding it down
King Dizzy get them girls aroused when I'm around
Peep the visuals and I'm a keep this literal like trout
It's the physical so if you ain't capable then you wack
Remember them days in Vegas we taped it all in the house
No worries we had no vision to make it or make it out
This rap shit was just a fantasy
I had no energy for enemies that's sympathy for family
Stone cold
If I'm lying where's my long nose
10 year old soul rapping with some corn rows
Ya'll don't know the past
I got that spoken word flow and I'm a show yo ass
Steppin' on my toes and I'm a slap you with some shoulder pads
If you ain't moving with the music you should fall back
I'm moving with the Buddha and the bra strap
Gifted because I found out my talents even existed by staying consistent
When niggas told me I wasn't all that

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I'm more then alright
Got a good vibe, everyday I'm celebrating life
Living fly got 2 Wings and a crown
(Living like a king now)
Nothing but love, got a good buzz
Want to give the whole wide world a hug
Living high like 2 wings and a crown
