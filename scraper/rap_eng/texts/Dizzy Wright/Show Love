[Bridge]
Yeah, Yeah
In the fast lane, I can't slow down
Gotta maintain I'm on a roll now
Got a main stage in my home now
I show love for my hometown, so
Show love cos' a mother-fucker faded
Show love cos' a mother-fucker made it
In the fast lane, I can't slow down
Gotta maintain I'm on a roll now
Got a main stage in my home now
I show love for my hometown, so
Show love cos' a mother-fucker faded
Show love cos' a mother-fucker made it

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Uh
Show love to this everything
Making room for new niggas etcetera
If you using this style I respect that you didn't neglect then fold under pressure
Look, I'm working on a brand new album
Starting a brand new semester
I shit's on different investors
Finna blow up and then be with the extras
Money problems, smiling, wailing I'm stylin'
Smoking pot I feeding tops from the islands
Finna rip the stage and if it ain't crowded
Yeah my words move mountains
I don't ever worry bout how many gonna get it
Cos' I know my fans gon be there
And I don't need no one to place me with placements I get there no racing that shit we'll be there
Out the country tryna find me some weed head
Then somebody hit me on the facebook
Hit the pics see how they look
Message me back, "ey bruh you got me on a half ounce
I need it quick I just popped in your town
We on the last blunt out the whole fucking pound
We trying blow this tour bus down
Hit me when you get close"
Roll up, showll up get go

[Bridge]
Yeah, Yeah
In the fast lane, I can't slow down
Gotta maintain I'm on a roll now
Got a main stage in my home now
I show love for my hometown, so
Show love cos' a mother-fucker faded
Show love cos' a mother-fucker made it
In the fast lane, I can't slow down
Gotta maintain I'm on a roll now
Got a main stage in my home now
I show love for my hometown, so
Show love cos' a mother-fucker faded
Show love cos' a mother-fucker made it

[Verse 2: Just Juice]
Yeah
Show love while we breaking it down
Rolling it up, making our rounds
Coast to coast we the talk of the town
So loud get it high for the love of our sounds
I ain't never going back to the four-door
With the world in my hand I can't fold now
I gotta do it big for the fam back home
Front row when they see me at my shows now
I'm faded, I made it I'll sit on my throne
Paper stay with me I'm never alone
Close to the hole in the ground
So I'm tipping my lid to the greats making rub on my dome
Piff in the blunt, can't get the bone, drinking the cup sippin' it slow
ASAP we wild for the night yo, we Taipei no typo, yeah
I'm shooting the gun all for fun on the hunt like a tooth picking soldier
Kicking the dojo, ripping the fow-fo, ripping the dojo, sipping four loco hold up
Better get your low up, showing off when we blow we gon showll up
Shouts out to Mojo whopping the dojo blowing smoke into the ozone

[Bridge]
Yeah, Yeah
In the fast lane, I can't slow down
Gotta maintain I'm on a roll now
Got a main stage in my home now
I show love for my hometown, so
Show love cos' a mother-fucker faded
Show love cos' a mother-fucker made it
In the fast lane, I can't slow down
Gotta maintain I'm on a roll now
Got a main stage in my home now
I show love for my hometown, so
Show love cos' a mother-fucker faded
Show love cos' a mother-fucker made it

[Verse 3: Mojo]
Yeaah
To get her home she got just enough gas
Cause' we been doing laps around the city with the booty in the glass
Like, she know, yo, got light skin mo got go solo cause I'm gon roll up now
The last man couldn't do the shit I shouldn't but if she didn't wanna she wouldn't don't sit in my table like it's got wet paint
Lotta pull up play not a runaway sass
Holding it up while I hold it down
And if I ever get rough don't call the fam
Killing it she know that's what I'm all about it
If I was nobody now you're up in it now
I'm like Owen Wilson with the Bilson on the building on the kill screen with the ranger Bilson
Ah, don't call me up, any other day works, I'll be up
Both ways make sure to wrap it up
Like Christmas time baby I'll be acting up
You gotta get it quick and be fast enough
Then we finish huts, don't get mad at us

[Bridge-Outro]
Yeah, Yeah
In the fast lane, I can't slow down
Gotta maintain I'm on a roll now
Got a main stage in my home now
I show love for my hometown, so
Show love cos' a mother-fucker faded
Show love cos' a mother-fucker made it
In the fast lane, I can't slow down
Gotta maintain I'm on a roll now
Got a main stage in my home now
I show love for my hometown, so
Show love cos' a mother-fucker faded
Show love cos' a mother-fucker made it
