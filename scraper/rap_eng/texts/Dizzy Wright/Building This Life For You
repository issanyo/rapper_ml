[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Look, I know I made some mistakes
But baby I can't take it away
I'm tryna make it okay, used to kick it late in the day
Now you, thinking a way to find a place in my day
It takes time for this kinda shit to work
Especially when being used and being hurt
Is the moral of the story, you can be for me
By making us strong, dealing our own
While I'm singing this song

[Chorus: Chel'le]
I'm building this life for you
I just wanna see you smile
Don't care bout what you can do
We living life in the now
I'm building this life for you

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Uhh
With a little bit of effort, we can make love look cool
Become one, see no evil, learn about me and I could learn about you
See it ain't no pressure, honesty is all I ask
And I'ma take care of all that ass
Caressing my fresh fade, massages after stressed days
Beautiful and it ain't even yo best day
I'm loving the chemistry, demonstrating my weakness
You a queen and I'm in need of the treatment
You stuck on defense
But I guess that's a good thing
But I'm just not here for the good things
I wanna love you with all your flaws, your ex was a dog
So he made you feel like you couldn't be you
But I'ma, give you my all, applaud when you stand tall
And make every girl in the world wanna be you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
Uhh
Every nigga has issues
To leave me would be as dumb as it gets
And if, what we got is really something you into
You should be willing to put in a hundred percent
I told, lies, avoid cries
Man looking out a boys eyes, tryna make the right moves
Stimulating by wrong, bitches turning me on
But I never met a pretty woman like you
Living life in the now, nice with a smile
Trips on the plane spending long nights in the clouds
We only live once, ain't no price on this side
So we shop till we drop then we out
We calling in bonding
They calling it caking, they hatin'
That's why they single and waitin'
I remain patient, gave something you can believe
You plus me is all I need
C'mon!

[Chorus]
