[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, Jeremy Scotts or these thirteens?
(Which one?) With the wings
But I'm fly like Jordan off of that first string (can't decide)
Call me fresh prince, with this flattop, I'mma take you back
Retros with that face to match
Take a risk when I lace the kicks
Cause I walk on the crowd
Call it cloud surfing
I'm the man out here
Shoe game clean, nigga and my gear
Nigga nigga
You a fan out here
You're a fucking with a lame
Baby stand right here, yeah
Give it up to a new nigga
Kid ill, he a true spitter
Shoes with ya, she Teyana Taylor bad with a nice round ass
Trying to see what I'mma do with her, yeah yeah
Let her get it if she back into it
Button up with a snap included
Young nigga with a chest full of tats
Get back fore' I kick you with the Patrick Ewing
Can't stop and it won't stop
Nigga you rap but you won't pop
Its a long shot
Dirty nigga you have no style
Low key, you in the wrong spot
Let the beat drop
Dre beats for the beep-bop
Good weed, I'm on a tree clock
I don't see hate
Make way for the young boys
Getting rich its a good day
Good god, I'm
So fly I don't need help
We making moves, wear your seat belt
Shit finna get real
For the club
Cause I'm getting hella love
And I'm just getting my feet wet

[Chorus]
Now nigga dat, now nigga dat
Now nigga dat, now nigga dats fashion
Now nigga dat, now nigga dats fashion
Now nigga dat, now nigga dats fashion

And I'm fresh as fuck if you ask me
All gold and I'm flashy

[Verse 2: Honey Cocaine]
Im fresh as fuck if you ask me
(all gold and im flashy)
Come thru wearing like 6 chains
Chanel shit from the 70s
Your shit wack, your shit lame
I'm shiting all on the enemies
Them double Cs, French shit
Rose gold piece, im a french bitch
Gold so soft you can bend it
But this shit so heavy, im dented
Like god, damn, got white gold
Got goldie gold, got 24 carat thats Kobe gold
We T.dot kids
They know we cold
Like , ugh, shit
You ain't no star, got no time
You got no bars, you got no rhymes
And you wearing shit i wore in 09'
How you feel when you late as fuck
Copy my style, gon' scrape it up
I be feeling like a milli when I'm waking up
My main bitch out in Philli she'll shape you up (ugh)
You worry about looking like a 10
You better worry about keeping it a hunnid
All those clothes don't really mean shit
Cuz' the weak hoes get no lovin'
Been fresh then a bitch, since 9th grade
Show you how to ball, in 9 ways
The north side bitches be bad as fuck
Coolin' in some Js them 9 greys
Prolly 80K on my fucking neck that's Why the 'G'est of the 'G'est
Niggas show me respect

[Chorus]
Now nigga dat, now nigga dat
Now nigga dat, now nigga dats fashion
Now nigga dat, now nigga dats fashion
Now nigga dat, now nigga dats fashion
And I'm fresh as fuck if you ask me
All gold and I'm flashy
Now nigga dat, now nigga dat
Now nigga dat, now nigga dats fashion
Now nigga dat, now nigga dats fashion
Now nigga dat, now nigga dats fashion
And I'm fresh as fuck if you ask me
All gold and I'm flashy

[Verse 3 :Kid Ink]
Fresh as fuck i need a lifestyle
Condom, my lifestyle
Ain't common, just let me school you like mr.high tower
Higher then a concord
Pair high top 11s on
Niggas know im a fashion killa
So you better have your weapon drawn,
The best dressed and i bet on it
100k round my neck, golden
Less friends with more money
Drivin' round like a crash dummy,
Young city boy and i know it
Long socks see the stance,
I got these naked and famous hoes
Tryna get all in my pants (damn)
Flyer than Pan Am
Always in beast mode
But PETA said no lamb skin
Fake furs, no fake sneakers
Im ballin in Balmain
Dress to kill by the grim reaper
Alumni snap, fuck Tisa
You niggas all dressed in fuck-season
I walk thru the sand in these LeBron James southbeachers
I dont give a damn i got two pairs,one without creases
Wild'n'out for no reason
Red bottoms on the red carpet
Fashion for what i headstarted, the run way
Nigga dont play

[Chorus]
Now nigga dat, now nigga dat
Now nigga dat, now nigga dats fashion
Now nigga dat, now nigga dats fashion
Now nigga dat, now nigga dats fashion
And I'm fresh as fuck if you ask me
All gold and I'm flashy
Now nigga dat, now nigga dat
Now nigga dat, now nigga dats fashion
Now nigga dat, now nigga dats fashion
Now nigga dat, now nigga dats fashion
And I'm fresh as fuck if you ask me
All gold and I'm flashy
