[Verse 1]
My first expression is often your first impression
I learned from lessons that beauty can bring neglection
Never was accepted, always second
So being first is like being put on the pedestal and under pressure
I ain't tryin' to pressure you
But puttin' that wall up tonight is unacceptable
I'm tryna get next to you
And introduce you to some happiness
You focus way too much on the negatives and the flashy shit
So let my words ease your mind
Let your soft skin go n' lean on mine
I would sing it but I can't, no special occasions
I make you smile when you ain't
Be all strong when you can't
Dont ever be afraid to smile
Focus on your craft and live in the right now
See baby you got soul, and that's what matter
Cause if it was a disaster
I'd be glad to meet you after
Cause

[Hook]
You, you, you
Oh you make me happy
So happy (2x)

[Verse 2]
I could gas you up and make you a believer
Tell you that I never lied and that I never been a cheater
Tell you I'm a keeper, just starting with fibs, shit
But thats the same way you started with him
You want different or a difference?
Its about that time
With a little quality time we can be a Bonnie and Clyde
You are, prescriptions, decision, revising, revisit, relisten
Ya you give me that feeling that I get when I be goin' hard
You strong aura you got the soul of 100 Rosa Parks
See I love it, And you don't even see
How yo' positive energy feeds off me
I feed the public, I need to love it. But I dont need the games
I wanna know about your past, but I don't need no names
I know this game might seem the same
But if you believe in me, then you will see the change
Cause baby girl

[Hook]
You, you, you
Oh you make me happy
So happy (2x)

[Verse 3]
Uhh
No need to slow down, fuck how they been livin'
Pay attention, pay a visit to your greatest wishes
Yo' tuition is expensive, that's irrelevant
What you pay can't even afford this kind of intelligence
Hesitant to sexual shit
Holdin' your grounds even though you ain't had sex in a bit
So I'mma tease, listen to you breathe just to hear it
Wisdom of a lyric got me in-tune with your spirit, uhh
And now I wanna sing to you
I never thought this pain would bring me you
But man I'm thankful and I'm loyal
Spoiled and appreciative
Give you all my love if you just keep it real, uhh
I know I fucked up in the past
But my fuck ups made me luck up with yo' ass, uhh
I said I fucked up in the past
But my fuck ups made me luck up with yo' ass
And I hope I make you happy

[Hook]
You, you, you
Oh you make me happy
So happy (2x)
