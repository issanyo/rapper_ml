[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, went to sleep taking dabs and I woke up like this (Yes I did)
I just be smoking
I'm in my own world, but you still gotta notice the risk (Yes I do)
If you going through it, just act like you knew this moment
'Cause I wrote it for this (right)
Can't be stuck on no emotional shit (no!)
Got to get back on your grind (your grind!)
The universe gave me the signs (the signs!)
I'm the, I'm the, I'm the, I'm the boss, I'm the CEO (come on)
Live your life, but it's something that you need to know (right)
Fuck the man and the others giving GMO's (fuck 'em)
We know the plan, yeah, we know the plan
We know the Earth give us everything
Skin too dark, might be too advanced (talk to 'em)
Even the young know that you the man (you the man!)
But they can teach us how to do the dance (do the dance)
And we gon' teach 'em how to think for themselves
Utilize it and pursue the plan
I know they probably got their eye on me now, why?
Willie Lynch will never be able to lynch me again
I got too much sauce
I just hopped off a stage, hope it rubbed off
They should put away the real drug dealers giving processed drugs off (Fuck y'all)
Okay, who can you blame
Music, culture, entertainment but you entertain (damn)
Slavery the system, dog it's all the same (damn)
We don't even get to use our whole brain (no)
Fuck 'em, I gotta defend my (yeah)
We programmed to walk on a thin line
This is pretend time
Y'all stuck on these trends, like y'all don't know what the fuck a sucking place is
I can't get mine

[Hook: Chelle]
No way, I got control (that's what you do now)
We've been blinded, know who you're grinding for (look around, dog)
I'm not brainwashed, they're coming for your soul (pay attention, man)
No way, no way, I know (come on)
No way, I got control (that's what you do now)
We've been blinded, know who you're grinding for (look around, dog)
I'm not brainwashed, they're coming for your soul (pay attention, man)
No way, no way, I know

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
I got knocked down, but it didn't hurt too much
Now, I might have to drop this on my birthday month
I'm talking elevating, celebrating this melanin
Nobody illustrate it better than (who is that?)
The D-I-double Z-Y, they feeling CY
I'm ready to kick these suckers in the head with my Fila's (E-I, E-I!)
I'm feeling like a St. Lunatic
Dizzy out of here, your lady might faint in this bitch
'Cause I'm sending love to them cancer babies
Fuck doctors that kill with them anti-savings
If you hate me, debate me or emancipate me
They say I'm insane, but I'm fancy crazy (ha-ha)
Protective, you could tell I'm solid as a rock (right)
Preach black love cause the black woman's God (yes, she is)
Know this, so you know you came from nothing to something
Peace, God, you know that it's kings that I come with (that I run with)
They took our knowledge away and it may seem wrong (seem wrong)
Looking ahead at history we could lean on (lean on)
Looking up, even though I'm the one they sleep on (sleep on)
Before the shooting, we was LV strong
Yeah, I'm back, dirty Vans thinking in 30 ways
I talked to the gods and goddesses living in traps (traps)
I can't chill, we can't breathe
I can't be blackballed, this the spirit of the Black Wall Street
All black on, got knocked back, we back on (back on)
More than rap songs (rap songs), no one to blame
But you can't tell me that the system ain't an organized game
Hiding behind laws that ain't ever gonna change (true)
Slavery, the system, dog, it's all the same (it is)
We can't even get to use our whole brain
But it's cool, 'cause I know I'm finding inner peace (inner peace)
Know yourself before you try to know the enemy
Don't lose your soul (lose your soul)

[Hook: Chelle]
No way, I got control (that's what you do now)
We've been blinded, know who you're grinding for (look around, dog)
I'm not brainwashed, they're coming for your soul (pay attention, man)
No way, no way, I know (come on)
No way, I got control (that's what you do now)
We've been blinded, know who you're grinding for (look around, dog)
I'm not brainwashed, they're coming for your soul (pay attention, man)
No way, no way, I know
