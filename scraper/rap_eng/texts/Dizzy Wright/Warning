[Verse 1]
I was, I was taught to never make assumptions
And now we're making something out of nothing
I thought I would never switch teams like Duncan
So now you all telling me I am not a Spur
Making all these old feelings start to reoccur
That's the reason I don't trust niggas
Woe, niggas fighting over words, niggas fighting over colors
Woe, we not fighting off the enemy, we fighting all the brothers?
Woe, now where the sense in that acting like the shit is undercover
God damn, god damn, you in trouble, you in trouble, it's a warning

[Hook]
Turn it up everyday don't be lazy this a warning
Brainstorming everyday don't be lazy this a warning

[Verse 2]
I feel like I should be telling you about yourself
But I'm a let you handle it until you got nobody else
No running to the public, never holding grudges I'm better by myself
I'm back on my solo dolo shit, but Moski Mo still got me high as hell
I've been on tour for a while trying to stack up my bread
Back up off me nigga no respect we know you faking to get ahead
Well mission accomplished, keep it real when you know you the problem
Keep it real with yourself and your options
But try not to lose your soul

[Hook x2]
