[Intro]
This about to be a party
Tryna reunite for the night
This about to be a party

[Hook : ]
And we all like
What it do? It's good to see you, na it's good to see you
Same girlfriend sittin' over there lookin' cute
I'm glad you found your talent and your putting it to use
And we all like
What it do? It's good to see you, na it's good to see you
Glad you in town, I ain't seen you in a while
You been holding shit down, keep making the city proud
And we all like

[Verse 1: ]
Momma let us rent out the crib, tryna reunite for the night
A couple bottles, everybody putting in on it, its about to be a party for the price
Where the folks I ain't seen in a while?
Heard you had a child, hope you turn that into a ring and a vow
Momma and the daddy ain't together, but they going through shit
Cause the momma caught the daddy sleeping around so she out
With the same homegirls that she used to call ratchet
Shut up Dizzy stick to rapping
I know, I ain't mean it I'm just making sure you looking through your glasses
I love to leave my friends laughing
We all came through, lets toast, drank, and smoke dank
Uncle Chewy only used to the homegrown
He sat back when the bone-bone
Ran thangs, he would smoke blunts with my momma while she did his cornrows
I'm just trying to bring life to the party, its 2014 where yo mind at?
Where you used to be, we supposed to be beyond that
It's funny cause I'm still dodging contracts
Looking at my life through a peep-hole
Can't bring time back, fuck it I'm a turn it with my people
Still moving at the right pace
Can't complain homie life's great

[Hook : ]

This about to be a party
Tryna reunite for the night
This about to be a party
And we all like

Yo Hoppa run that back for me, I got something fly I want to kick

[Verse 2: ]
No flights, no drama, just fans
Before this I ain't never give a damn
Who got some coke? Cause I'm a mix it with some hen
Who got a swisher? I'm a fill it with a gram
We at a party at the house going ham
My niggas like damn you on MTV Jams?
Man that shit so cray, I be smoking to your music every day
Brother you don't understand (that's the reason you my mans though)
Now we talking through a bottle
Reminiscing on Mr. Stellavato
Graduated school to give niggas something to follow
Cause you could be here today and you could be gone tomorrow
Ain't nobody sitting on they own
Niggas singing songs playing beer pong
Its okay that we can't always do the right thang
Cause I heard a little laugh can make you live long
How 'bout you fuck off instead of trying to fuck up the day
Don't know who you trying to scare a wrong place
Since the trip in at the door with the next-door neighbors
Football with out the gear on, Hennessy damn near gone and that explains it all
You better calm down and shake it off
Live by the three M's "Maintain, Mary Jane, Make Art"
And enjoys your days off
Can I get a amen?

This about to be a party
Tryna reunite for the night
