[Hook]
All she do is just roll my weed and get naked for me at night
That's all she do, that's all she do
All she do is just roll my weed and get naked for me at night
That's all she do, that's all she do
(We come alive in the night time)
(We come alive in the night time)
(We come alive)

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
She fuck me with cause I ain't with the drama though
I fuck with you on my set but you know how it go
I want your body baby girl but I don't know
I feel like if I take it there then I'ma have to take it there
She rolling up telling me, "Sit in the chair"
Get naked, telling me I'm gonna make it there
I'm tryna play it fair, you fucking with a player player
Bounce on it for a player player
Come, let's ride to the beat
Stoner girl, freak she on fleek
You ain't been this high in weeks, take you to your peak
I'm tryna be Nicki and Meek
I'm not playing, I'm playing for keeps, give me all that you got
Embrace your beauty while I'm grabbing on your booty
And I'm hitting every spot
Tell me what you here for
Well open your legs, I want more, shit
I guess I'm just tryna explore (Look, watch)
I ain't sext nobody in a minute girl
I been looking for somebody I can give the world
And if you down let me know cause I'm with it for rounds
She roll up, I hit it, then puff on this crown
Moving your body to the sound, now we at it
When I'm with her everything is automatic
Copacetic she don't ever be dramatic
Wake-and-baking is a habit, got me rethinking my status and I love that

[Verse 2: Demrick]
We make time just to spend time
I stopped by to lay you down like it's bed time
She ain't try to lock it down like some fed time
She just wanna give me head and get her head high
Ash in the sheets, we smashed to the beat then it's back to the street
It's like you riding with me in the passenger seat
Cause I know where to go when my night is complete, preach
Dazed and sedated, infatuated with watching you naked
What strand is your favorite? Baby come here taste it
We gonna definitely blaze it, let's make the night amazing
We come alive, come alive
Hustle nightly to survive, no lie
And you sexy all the time, don't try cause there's no need
Just proceed to blow trees and we G
