This that Boulder Highway pimping
East side, east side, east side
Sam's Town budget, sweet high
Riding down Nellis in my G ride
This that Boulder Highway pimping
East side, east side, east side
Sam's Town, budget suite high
Riding down Nellis in my G ride

[Verse 1]
Get it the fastest, riding that cut to my classes
We can hit onset then we gon' hit up Crystal Palace
Ain't no lolly gagging, hitting home runs when I'm batting
Bowling alley cracking, knocking one from Dallas
She like the East side and I like her accent
Told her I'ma flash it then flash the passion
Race round here, hit me up when you visiting, all you gotta do
Is let me know what the mission is and we gon' get to it, cause man

[Post-Hook]
I'm just rolling, rolling, rolling
Down the east side, east side, east side
I'm just rolling, rolling, rolling
Down the east side, east side, east side
I'm just rolling, rolling, rolling
Down the east side, east side, east side
Sam's Town, budget suite high
Riding down Nellis in my G ride

[Verse 2]
And I'm like
I'm too much to handle, I'm at The Cannery, bring your cameras right
Met a bad one that lived on Bonanza, I'm tryna see what your stamina like
I can't be the man in your life, woah, so I'ma stay on the sideline
We was kicking it on Boulder Highway and Russell right next to the Popeyes
Brown eyes, 5'5", on the real, I want a Grammy
Drinking Hennessy and Hennessy back when FroZEN75 was cracking
I had the party going and I still got it going
I just been taking my time to get 'em in line and you falling for it
