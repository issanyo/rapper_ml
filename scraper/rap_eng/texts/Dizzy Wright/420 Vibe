[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I
Always got that 420 vibe
(Man, I got a vibe)
Man, I got so high I couldn't drive
(Couldn't even drive)
Look at what I did by 25
(25, nigga)
Dizzy OG, thank God we alive
(We alive)
'Cause I always got that 420 vibe
(You know I got it)
I always got that 420 vibe
(You know I got it, nigga)
You know I keep that 420 vibe
(Blaze one with me then)
Dizzy OG, thank God we alive, ay

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Ay, Dizzy OG all up in my paper
(That's what I'm smokin')
Ay, but Dizzy Wright about to run for mayor, whoa
Started my label
Now they think I'm givin' out favors
Too bad a couple niggas that I used to fuck with
Turned into haters
(But that's your problem)
Don't be hittin' my line
'Cause I ain't got the time
I told you once: "Nigga, don't front online"
I know what the fuck you want
Seeing through these fools
Mad 'cause I made they girlfriend booty move
In my G ways I'm just too damn cool
Nigga what life do to you
Ay, lookin' mad at me
I be smokin', I be mad happy
I don't really worry 'bout these niggas
That be makin' comments throwin' jabs at me
Dad hat feelin' dab-happy
With the 420 vibe
Ay, I love Vegas for the 24/7 (?)
You can see that I

[Verse 2: Lil Debbie]
Wo-wo-word around town is Debbie down the road
They ain't never lie, all my bitches fly, April 20 vibe
Yeah, that's right, bitch, I feel like Pac circa 95
Screamin' "death to all my haters", we can't let it slide
Bi-bitch, I'm 'bout to ride sucide, it's a suicide
Fuckin' with the squad, never tell advice, pray to stay alive
Play your lane or test your luck against the crew
Bitch, you decide, foolish pride
Got these bitches outta pocket
I'm just chiefin' with the tribe, let's get high
Bitch, I blow 'em back to back to back
Kobe, Shaq, I'm too fuckin' high to see a hoe react
I'm too fuckin' faded to see you salty I made it
They hate it from the beginning
My pedals still hit the pavement, oh
Lookin' mad at me
I be smokin', I be mad happy
They used to laugh at me
Now promoters throwin' cash at me
Money long, now weed is strong
Now, bitch I be livin' that high life
Blowin' that kush be the highlight
Pass me a light, now the vibe's right
