[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Yo, Futuristic spit that flow that niggas never heard before
Yes I am the shit, you act like you ain't seen a turd before
You're a whore, girl! You act like you ain't heard that word before
Don't mind if I do just jump off in the crowd
Everybody get loud when we're on tour
I got real raps for these fake niggas
Y'all actin', Drake nigga
You never had a birthday, you don't get no cake nigga
I'm on a roll, I don't skate nigga
Don't fuck up no beats bitch
Put that ho on a water bed, fuck around and get sea sick
I stay fly, 3-6
Kill a beat like a drummer with three sticks
I don't usually smoke, but now I'm higher than a ski lift
W-T-F gang in the the buildin'
Don't mind if I do get wild boy
I'm in the game and you lookin' like a towel boy
Take shots like a mothafuckin' cowboy
Now hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Did a nigga really just sauce like that?
Floss like that, Rick Ross like that (Roo!)
Nigga I bark right back!
Flow so sick, cough like that
Them niggas washed up Randy Moss like that
Eatin' all these niggas I'm a shark like that
Don't mind if I do go hard like that!

[Hook]
Killin' every track (Don't mind if I do)
Fuckin' bitches from the back (Don't mind if I do)
Do a show get a rack (Don't mind if I do)
(Don't mind if I do) (Don't mind if I do)
They see us they hatin'
We smokin we faded
We grindin' we made it (don't mind if I do)
They see us they hatin'
We drinkin' we faded
We grindin' we made it (don't mind if I do)

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
She say Dizzy you so tight, I'm glad you on this beat
Before I rip my verse, I'm a have to hit this weed
Pause, pause, pause, pause
Smoke it out...
Pause, pause, pause
Ok, I'm a hawk in the streets
Lemme lay off of the weed, I'm a boss on the beat
We don't really mind all the hate
Cause bitch niggas talkin' is cheap, and I'm talkin to eat
I'm from the 7-0-2
Before I took off in the game, I took off from the East
Made a name for myself, and I proved 'em wrong
And I'm sittin back sparkin the weed
Tell em I'm the man now, hands down
And that's bossin' talk to the fullest
I'm 21 and when you think of Vegas you think of me and them tourists
I did this shit, I'm happy bout it, braggin' 'bout it, Jay-Z
I'm feelin my nigga you shinin but nigga
I'm grindin and nigga you ain't me! I'm

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
She say, "Jarren you so dope,"
I'm like hell yeah bitch I know, shit
Before I rip this beat, I'm a have to snort this coke
Leggo
Swag, swag, swag
Leggo
Swag, swag, swag
Yup, don't mind if I do, mind of a jew
Pockets on bitch, no time for you
I pull up in this bitch lookin fly as a pelican
Old school chain and designer shoes
Beast on the beat I'm a feast on the track
I'm a strangle the mic lightin' fire in the booth
Nigga wanna act, I"m a show up with a Mossberg
Pumpin' the mothafucker nina do
Gotta a sneaker fetish, I'm a eat a rapper
With a loaf of bread and a piece of lettuce
Lord please forgive us, these niggas hate us
They bitches feel us, Fresh Prince
With no Aunt Viv and no Uncle Phil
I'm about to make a billion, bitch I'm brilliant
Futuristic, with Futuristic, POW POW bitch we fucking killin' em!

[Hook]
