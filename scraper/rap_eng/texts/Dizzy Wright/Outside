[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Outside (x4)
I hate when niggas
Tell me that the weed too loud
Take it outside
Outside (x3)
I hate when niggas
Tell me that the weed too loud

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
You don't know nobody yet
But we gon' help grow recreational (for real!)
We gon' help the education grow
I hit up Reezy he said 'say no more' (you feel me?)
My foot in the door already
My nigga we more than ready
Toronto sessions got me getting love like Norm Kelly smoking out of [?] I'm
Finna smoke 'em like ''who coming with me?''
Heard the smoking fee's 250
Well I guess that's only if they catch me
Setting bad examples isn't healthy
James Harden hit 'em with the lefty
Shit is getting messy
I'm in [?] heavy
I'm gon' get high they don't gotta let me (I'm gon' get high)

[Bridge]
I hate when niggas
Act like we can't roll up
Man I hate when niggas
Trip when I'm paid to pull up
I hate when niggas
Want us out in the open
Man I hate when niggas
Kick us out for smoking

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Demrick]
In one state I'm great and the next is hate
Want the government debates, we all speculate
On what's legal and what's not
See some call police when they see that we puff pot
Go right down the street and you can fill up a lunch box
Smoking in a park with a mother and son watching
Our city is dumb hot
Security (please!) let me out my moment
I just brought a little weed
Let me blaze it in the open
I'll be right now smoking hot blow with my eyes open
Shit, I just lit it up I need some time on it
I'm peepin' on the exit, keep my eye on it
Money got my mind on it, puffing on the [?] on it
Makes sense
I used to hustle packs to pay rent
So why you mad I snuck a eighth then?
'Cause I'ma never stop blazing out in public
You can hate it or love it
Fuck it I'm just sayin'
