[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Everybody know that I'm a beast
Live your life it's a lot to see
Never steppin' on the logo G I got it tatted on my marijuana leaf
Dizzyhippy bout to make it happen
Legend money is what I'm chasin' after
Fuck these niggas man these niggas backwards
I'm loyal to the Sawyer boy we 'atcha
We don't fuck with suckers we unattach 'em I swear to God I had to look at the data
Seen so many niggas trade on a boy cause everybody wanna climb up the ladder
Envy is real it don't matter
And the whole world can't be trusted
Since FV gone I'm adjusted
Now get the witness all of y'alls that I'm rushin' I mean

[Pre-Hook]
How many of you finna act like you love me and then turn your back? (then turn your back)
How many of you finna act like you hate me then learn my raps? (then learn my raps)
How many of you really down with me?
How many of you down?
It ain't all love they gon pick you all the way up to tear you down goddamn

[Hook]
Why you gotta do me like that?
Lil homie why do me like that? (why you do me like that?)
Why you gotta do me like that?
Lil mama why you do me like that? (why you do me like that?)
It used to be love on wax lil homie
Why you do me like that? (why you do me like that?)
It used to be love on wax (on wax)
It used to be love on wax (on wax)

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
It used to be used to be used to be
All these fake niggas confusing me
I know some of y'all went to school with me
I know my life look like a movie screen
I'm still movin' but you not movin' me
You suckas trying too hard but man truthfully if you can't be yourself that shit ain't cool to me
This industry is just a zoo to me
It ain't new to me to hit em with a fresh look
Then I hit my dance like Westbrook
Then I hit these niggas with a left hook
Until I'm money Mayweather with the checkbook
Woah me and skates on skates for the payday
I'm getting head at the Mandalay Bay
Man motherfucka date rape
Getting paid for the day party if date [??]
What I'm doing wrong?

[Pre-Hook]
How many of you finna act like you love me and then turn your back? (then turn your back)

How many of you down?
It ain't all love they gon pick you all the way up to tear you down goddamn

Why you do me like that? (why you do me like that?)
It used to be love on wax (on wax)
It used to be love on wax (on wax)

[Verse 3: Skate Maloley]
How you gonna do me like that?
Lil homie how you do me like that?
Who be like that?
Getting woody like that
Saying sue me might [??]
You ain't knew me like that
Knew me like that
When I used to put your pack
Just to get up in the lab
You ain't knew me like that
Hustlin attack
Put my city on the map
Keep a hunnid thats a fact
Never do me like that
Roll up the Dizzy OG got me lit
You know we smoking that shit by the zip
Vegas to Omaha thats where we live
Got my Supreme boxers matching my fit
If you get money you know what it is
Me and my homies get straight to the biz
Before I pull up my name on the list
Open the door and they smelling the piff shit
I'm a different kind of person working certain I'm a be a better type
Who would ever thought the hip hop industry would wanna here another Pac
