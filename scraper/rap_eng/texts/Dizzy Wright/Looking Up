[Hook: Euroz & Dizzy Wright]
Things looking up
This shit was overdue
Just can't give up
Know what you going through
Got to search your soul now
Swear you'll find love
I see things looking up
Things looking up
This shit was overdue
Just don't give up
Know what your going through
Got to search your soul now
Swear you'll find love
I see things looking up

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I feel the rush and that's what got us looking up
Fully committed don't ever tell us we can't be good enough
This is the good verse evil and I'm the chosen one
To play both sides for the grounders and sky people
Now that's one hundred now
Jobs is getting hunted down
We doing a lot of these jumps around and moving storage units
Now I'm dealing with bad teachers who hate dealing with poor students
We go back and forth get into it and keep it moving
Yomp
We in constant motion
Stopping and going
The devil's watching
Do what you've done get what you've gotten
Plotting out in the open
I'm over searching my soul so I know what a lost soul is
Dog and life is what your thoughts make it
No false statements is making me cut throat
My Hennessy cup close
So put your shots up for Las Vegas
And all love for that immediate response
Play this TGA2 and stay calm

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
I can't give up I got to give more
You should be looking up, yo why your chin low?
I know you need that job and they keep hitting you with a N.O
I'm knowing that a job is for them kids that you live for
My nigga I'm a prayer for you
Denial could be discouraging
I told them this ain't a competition or a tournament
Poetic journalist
Love all my secret services
Unlock these verses in
Look at how conserving I been
So I wake up and wake and bake before the early gym
Break a sweat and now I'm washing off the dirty stamps
Top of the AM at the M chilling I live here
So I'm obviously the meal ticket
