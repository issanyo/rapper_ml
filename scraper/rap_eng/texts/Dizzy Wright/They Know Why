[Hook]
How you see us scream but you ain't hear us?
I see the way you act when you get near us
I'm realizing why the police fear us
They know why, they know fucking why, aye
And if you don't obey then they'll kill ya
Martial law is coming, get familiar
Donald Trump ain't no different from Hitler, aye
They know why, they know fucking why, aye

[Verse 1]
Hours slinging CDs like a mountain (and they got me)
And when I X out Martin I be Malcolm
I be feeling violent when I see it
When I see how my people get treated
Responded with this anger, it's a set up
Families of the fallen, keep your head up
I seen this kid crying cause his father die
All these losers in these badges being qualified
Ain't you supposed to serve and protect me?
Do the color of my skin make you neglect me?
Do I gotta die to make your heart feel heavy? Aye
Martial law is coming, is you ready?
Riding with my daughter and my son with me, real change
I'mma have Snoop and Game come with me
This the same country that enslaved us
Black lives matter, scattered cause this is how you made us

[Hook]
How you see us scream but you ain't hear us?
I see the way you act when you get near us
I'm realizing why the police fear us
They know why, they know fucking why, aye
And if you don't obey then they'll kill ya
Martial law is coming, get familiar
Donald Trump ain't no different from Hitler, aye
They know why, they know fucking why, aye

[Verse 2]
I needed answers and I never got 'em
Asking for his license then he shot him
Luckily technology done caught 'em
Sad part is he still get paid tomorrow
Paid suspension after he done took a life
Fuck the man that think that shit good advice
There some things you shouldn't do and shouldn't like
Y'all keep stabbing a culture with a butcher knife, aye
Did it right, what the fuck you think we angry for?
I said what Jesse Williams like I'm Samuel
My vision hella clear, we want a better year
We gotta ask for freedom like we never here
So my people wanna riot for the payback
Even though we know that won't bring MLK back (assasinated)
Okay okay, I feel like I done said enough
You dealing with a rebel, we gon' step it up

[Hook]
How you see us scream but you ain't hear us?
I see the way you act when you get near us
I'm realizing why the police fear us
They know why, they know fucking why, aye
And if you don't obey then they'll kill ya
Martial law is coming, get familiar
Donald Trump ain't no different from Hitler, aye
They know why, they know fucking why, aye
