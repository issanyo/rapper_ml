Part 1

[Chorus]
Money ain't get to ya head, money ain't get to ya head
Don't like nobody, try tell me it can't be done
I'mma get it in gold, don't tell me it can't be done
Might just pick up the bad, don't tell me it can't be done
Money ain't get to ya head, money ain't get to ya head
I'mma get it in gold, don't tell me it can't be done
I don't like nobody, try tell me it can't be done
Might just pick up the bad, don't tell me it can't be done

[Verse 1]
Wilding out I'm going crazy
Buckle up, we going out of space
I'm on a mission to get it
Tell them sucker niggas like me don't know how to wait
I'm getting [?] play
They follow me so I gotta give 'em something
I ain't making no assumptions
Balling out, I feel like UNLV's Larry Johnson
I should hit 'em with the windmill
Big deal, don't switch [?] for a kid's meal
Story teller but without the lies
The the new Slick Rick feel
Sick in the head
If you ain't fucking with the boy then jump off the ledge
I told 'em once back then
Asking what I been on
But I can tell that you ain't locked in
I don't fuck with fake friends
Everything I believe in I defend
My bitch told me "I just wanna see you fucking win"

[Pre-Chorus]
Do what I want, do what I want
Don't try to tell me it can't be done
If you gone pick up the bad then get it in gold
And get up then get off your ass, ayy
Got it, it's just me and my godest
First the talent, all my styles and ain't no way that you can stop it
But they tryna say that...

[Chorus]
Money ain't get to ya head, money ain't get to ya head
Don't like nobody, try tell me it can't be done
I'mma get it in gold, don't tell me it can't be done
Might just pick up the bad, don't tell me it can't be done
Money ain't get to ya head, money ain't get to ya head
I'mma get it in gold, don't tell me it can't be done
I don't like nobody, try tell me it can't be done
Might just pick up the bad, don't tell me it can't be done

[Verse 2]
Still can't trust them [?]
Hat to the back, Gucci backpack
Top notch [?]
Damn momma had [?] way back
Slashing days, rest in peace to Young Vegas
My nigga passed away
Thought of the homie when I started writing this
Now I gotta [?]
My energy can't be matched
Check my overall stats
I'm the GOAT, I'm the GOAT
I feel like LeBron with the Cavs
I ain't missing no playoffs, I ain't taking no days off
Still movin', say less
Let's get it in, get it in
[?] for the respect [?]
Move to the West, family finesse
I ain't choose this fucking life
They want me to slow down for the shit they seem to like
I want them to shut the fuck up and just let me write

[Pre-Chorus]
Do what I want, don't tell me man, don't tell me it can't be done
Known as a worldwide legend man don't tell me I can't be one
Talking shit, smoking weed, have your fun
When you got good energy they want some
But they tryna say that...

[Chorus]
Money ain't get to ya head, money ain't get to ya head
Don't like nobody, try tell me it can't be done
I'mma get it in gold, don't tell me it can't be done
Might just pick up the bad, don't tell me it can't be done
Money ain't get to ya head, money ain't get to ya head
I'mma get it in gold, don't tell me it can't be done
I don't like nobody, try tell me it can't be done
Might just pick up the bad, don't tell me it can't be done

Part 2

[Chorus]
I say vibrate low, vibrate low
Vibrate low (oh no), vibrate high (too high)
We know the same frequencys
Cause you don't use your third eye
We know the same frequencys
Cause you don't use your third eye
You vibrate low and I vibrate high
Vibrate low (oh no), vibrate high (too high)
We know the same frequencys
Cause you don't use your third eye
We know the same frequencys
Cause you don'tuse your third eye
You vibrate low and I vibrate high

[Verse 3]
Pay the funds
I knew one day that the day would come
They close out their apps cause their data run
But forget you a god, man you made of one
Don't forget you a king when the haters come
Gained knowledge now we locked and loaded
Went from shop lifting to shopping for it
Popovich coaching man they love the vision
Man you gotta focus but you never listen
Second guessing all your next decisions
Slow you down
You vibrating low, I'm vibrating high
Life's an expedition
Element, element, element
If you got a problem then settle it
Make money, save money
Don't tell me it cannot be done
Gotta use your intelligence
God damn brothers out here been..

[Chorus]
Vibrate low (oh no), vibrate high (too high)
We know the same frequencys
Cause you don't use your third eye
We know the same frequencys
Cause you don't use your third eye
You vibrate low and I vibrate high
