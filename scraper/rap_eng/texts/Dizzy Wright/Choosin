[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Sunny on the east side
Walked out fresh looked clean
I went for a ride
Drop my top for the breeze
Smoke me weed on a freeway
Bitch please I ain't got time
But if you want to jump inside
Baby don't lie put on your choosing shoes

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Yeah you bitch you
Game colder than a igloo
The new fresh prince hitting Will Smith moves
Would've hit the NBA if I had hit 6'2
A nigga never hit it but I made hits
Wasn't mixed down so I made an everyday list
Grind hard my nigga don't stop
Can't and I won't like these braids don't lock
Time to level up star boys like The Weeknd
Late night with a bag she can reach in
Iron out all my problems she gon' put the crease in
We don't sleep in we just dive off the deep end
By 25 I was tryna grow and plant seeds
Turning 25 grams in to 25 G's
Hate I got another nigga bitch choosing me
But she sucking like she a blew a 25 point lead
When I left it was

Bitch please I ain't got time

[Verse 2: G Perico]
Put on your shoes lets go you bitch
Ain't no time to waste we got to get digits
105 from the east side Long Beach boulevard
Hoes get to running when they see my car
Just tryna get my attention you ain't in pocket
Go ahead and throw the cash in my car and keep walking
Perico the rapper is what they saying
They worried about these niggas as long as I got a bitch paying
The Lord of land lets go get it
Hopping on delta jet blue whatever for the mission
Worldwide crossing countries it don't matter how it happen
Long as the bitch got the money
We celebrate all the time smoking Dizzy
Gangster niggas getting high like hippies
Burning grams down on the freeway
Slow down for the next stop we gon' exit on the B way

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]

Bitch please I ain't got time
But if you want to jump inside
Baby don't lie put on your choosing shoes

I'm just saying though bitch
From the gate I'm a let you know though
It wasn't against the rules to choose man
That's apart of this shit
It's called upgrading hoe yeah
