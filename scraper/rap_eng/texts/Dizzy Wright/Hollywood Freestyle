[Intro]
Yo, what's popping? It's your boy Dizzy Wright
Hollywood Freestyles, HipHopDX, on your bitch ass

[Verse 1]
Yo, guess who's in your Dre Beats
Walking down these Veg streets
Mister D-I double Z-Y
If you motherfuckers hate me
Can't relate to nothing that I be saying
There's a chance you shouldn't be alive
I'm moving, I don't need a whip
Rapping on my Four Agreements shit
Giving knowledge, you could keep the tip
He treat change like it's loose change
It hit the ground, he leave it there
Cause he don't wanna look lame, what a shame
I don't ego trip, I keep it a hundred
Niggas rather be hooked on phonics than graduate
That shit aggravate, nigga, get your mama a happy day
Don't throw your life away to sit at home and masturbate
Truth speaker, cooler than your new sneakers
The real thinker, but my crew deeper
I got these visionary plans
Thorough nigga, solid like a military man
And I'm feeling like the man

[Outro]
Dizzy Wright, yeah
