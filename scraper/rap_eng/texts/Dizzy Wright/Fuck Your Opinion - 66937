[Verse 1]
Jealousy is misery
Sufferin' is grief
Suffer trough the weak but still in touch with what I see
Fuck it up on these beats
But you would never notice
I've been hidin' what I'm holdin'
To the potent of this tree
Me, Myself and I, might not meet your standards
But I swear to God I'll try
Use the lord in vein to get my point across why?
Hate it but I do it like it'll be aight
God damn I need change
But then I just smiled
Why? Cause it ain't finna change nothing I'm around
Still gotta ride
Still gotta be down load up and make it happen
If shit evers gets wild
Surrounded by a crowd that you with it call friends
But these the same niggas that help you become a man
Poor child and war child hoppin' out this van
Police tried to get us so we ran
Fuck goin' to jail I got bills to pay
My everyday life make me feel this way
But can you blame me?
Hang me up and frame me
Tried to keep smilin' but the smiles be shady bein' fake make me angry
It change my flaws
Punished for the bad rewarded for the good man we trained like dogs
Can't see it, it ain't even
No freedom when they ain't leavin'
Pray for us we all need it

[Hook]
Lately man my prayin' gettin' stronger
But honestly there ain't never been a problem
I'm tryna find my connection with God
That's why I've been hidin' behind these marijuana
Stressin' and livin' such a blessin' if you listen
They want to judge to my connection different
So I made a decision, make me feel weird cause I don't get it
To the niggas and the bitches I just wanna say fuck your opinion

[Verse 2]
I'm blinded by successful thoughts
Everytime I come out they got their tongue out
Man I swear that I am dealin' with a stressful loss
We ain't hung out since he got strung out
And still I stand, these weed take a real big effect on how chill I am
Still alive but it killed my friend
I'm tryna show you my hurt, I'm not tryna show you how real I am
No one hear me cause It's all talk
Self made I ain't never finna fall of
We, actually talk ya all thoughts
Who woulda thought that little nigga from the ballpark
Would make a change in the world
Fucked up but it came with a girl
That helped me bring Zay in this world
Damn, I ain't comfortable in my own skin
But then again you gotta be brave in this world so my mind won
I ain't lyin' I ain't rhymin' for the shine mama
Have faith find God don't find drama
Ah here he go again this shit is so easy to lose
Your way in the city of the sin
Yeah, surrounded by hoes and pimps
Immune to it are two-words is no and if
Jehova kid but she gotta make a livin'
Bad decisions, good intentions
On her mission, nothin' ever handed
So she alredy made plans to ask god for forgiveness
Judging by the moment but you blinded by the hidden
I've been smokin' like a god damn hippe
Damn, but shit at least I'm doing my best
I've been grindin' since I moved to the west
I've been readin' more styles from either or
I am great you can see it at my shows
You'd be truly impressed, I do me the best
And nigga this a lesson through the herb
Growin' up I'm learnin' how to be impeccable with my words
Stressin' over nothin' but my heart keep me concerned
Thanking God for every blessin' that I earned
Dizzy Wright nigga

[Hook]
Lately man my prayin' gettin' stronger
But honestly there ain't never been a problem
I'm tryna find my connection with God
That's why I've been hidin' behind these marijuana
Stressin' and livin' such a blessin' if you listen
They want to judge to my connection different
So I made a decision, make me feel weird cause I don't get it
To the niggas and the bitches I just wanna say fuck your opinion

[Outro]
And I ain't no muthafuckin' weed rapper nigga
Expand your mind
Fuck your opinion
