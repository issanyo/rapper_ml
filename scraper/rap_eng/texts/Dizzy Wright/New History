Mic check, one two, one two
One time for your mind
Yo
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
As I rewind back, them contracts
I could've signed that
Now it's back to selling these dime sacks
Sucking my shorty dry
She wanna hold me down, but damn more important I
Gotta go sort out my ties (right)
Losing faith in a mate and she can't deny it
I ain't tryna eat off your plate
I'm tryna provide it (that's right)
Tryna clean my slate but we constantly caught with wilding, how childish
(how childish)
Ayo, ayo I'm ready to make some small changes
And stop thinking where my balls hanging
A liar just another version of a fraud, we evolve angry (evolve angry)
She say when niggas wanna be taught
That nigga gotta be caught from all angles (right)
But as I sit back and watch my TV what do I see Gosling talk about Stevie
Oh this is Love N Hip-Hop, entertainment through the week
How we ever supposed to love if this is what it claims to be
I mean damn

[Hook]
Society gonna be the death of me
You in control, choose your destiny (one time, one time)
Tell 'em freedom is a necessity
Respect me or don't F with me (two times, two times)
It ain't just to break they rules
A voice stepping in a great mans shoes (let the world know)
Motivate the kings that's uplifting me
Now homie that's some new history (thats some new history)
Let 'em know

[Verse 2]
Yo maybe these convolutions will help
Niggas better embrace me cause I'm pacing myself
Creating my path from all these relations I built
Yeah he's signed but he can't relate to himself
Now that I finally got my foot in the door
I analyze these fakes as I explore
Everyday we be learning a little more
Become saint when we record
Giving thanks for the support
Them footsteps before the golden age days we adored
Or
Let the way I was brought up, get a nigga caught up
Let the fact that I was broke allow money to solve all my problems
I mean, all niggas really talk about is getting rich
The struggle, guess it's easy to knock it when you ain't shit
When you feel the vibe
When niggas that's living life in a lie
When they got they ride and you standing outside
That drug money starting to fuck with my pride
Turning on my TV like I can't believe this is what I gotta be to survive
Damn

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It took some time to get the city involved
They applaud I worked hard now I'm convincing these blogs
No Based God, no new guard, no Kendrick Lamar
Fitty you jaw
Only nigga to make you piss in your drawers (greatness)
My homies told me that I was gifted with bars
If the industry called, pretty much 360 the call
Nigga's frauds
But I don't talk I hit the boof like a dog
I'm talking Doggy dog, DMX bouncing off with the bars (vegas)
Feed yo addiction cuz they pissing me off
You niggas lost taking charges they predicting my falls (stick to the cause)
But me I ain't no different from y'all
No sympathy, my enemies is getting kicked in the jaw (pause)
The young king got a chip on his shoulder don't gotta call out names niggas gon' slit their wrist when it's over
Don't compare me I ain't here to try to split the exposure
You fuckin' with me or I'm tripping you over
It's new history

[Hook]
