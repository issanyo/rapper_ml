[Intro]
Niggas talk that "real" shit
I don't even know what's real no more
These mothafuckas nowadays
Just be saying shit
A lot of shit going on in the world
And these niggas talkin about they real niggas

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Uh I never been the type to judge niggas
Fuck, niggas look at me like I lucked up nigga
But this shit is getting harder
Got a stomach full of liquor and I'm thinking about my daughter
I should be a-fucking-shamed of myself
Baby mama struggling, I put the fucking blame on myself
I should just grab my gat, and fucking aim at myself
I did this on my own, you niggas came with the help
So I disinclude and no I'm not dissing you
But in the interview, I clearly said I don't remember you, lil nigga
You ain't nothing but a lil nigga
Just me and my .45, it quite clear that you came full of niggas
Uh, I know that bullshit gangsta talk
But I don't ever get involved if I ain't involved
What you portraying dawg, blowing money
Fuck that, I'm trying to teach my child how to save it all

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
So if I vent to you, tell me can you see yourself making assumptions (making assumptions)?
Contradicting my shit from the outside, making a judgement (making a judgement) x2

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
I guess I'm just like everybody else, living in this world with no help
No guidance, no self-love, until I met drugs
Gangstas being imitated, by internet thugs, Shrugs
No hugs, just guns, just fun
He bust one, retaliate on my loved one
It ain't worth it, need a 9 to 5
It ain't working, not for me
So I'm doing it for a strange purpose
I ain't too focused on the "getting around,"
The pussy will come, I just can't be sitting around
Looking around, missed it when it could've been now
As good as they come, and got lost in the crowd
That's a sad story
See niggas just wanna hustle and rap
Rap music got bitch niggas in love with the trap
Me, I got that shit to make the government mad
Pussy nigga, how thuggin is that?
Take notes..

[Hook]
