[Hook: Dizzy Wright & Chelle]
I can't keep falling for the bullshit that they feeding me
I can't keep falling no no no
I can't keep falling no no no
I can't keep falling for the bullshit that they feeding me
I can't keep falling no no no
This shit is deeper than you think

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
From cross roads to seeing to how we cross paths
Day and night I work on them visions
Pen to the paper before I let all my thoughts pass
Only the Lord knows how many hours I've given
I been consistent but I guess that ain't the point right
Somebody got to tell me if I'm tripping
'Cause I'm misunderstanding something I ain't seeing your energy not complimenting your spirit
Sound like demons around me
If you don't believe then why you act like you like being around me
Learning that money was the root to the evil around me
This shit get deep 'cause I'm seeing what people think about me
Never been weak but I'm loyal to the soil without benefiting off every mother fucking independent move for me
And all of my G's
Life will teach you all your blessings ain't gon' come with a treat
I realize this friendship ain't cheap

[Hook: Dizzy Wright & Chelle]
I can't keep falling for the bullshit that they feeding me
I can't keep falling no no no
I can't keep falling no no no
I can't keep falling for the bullshit that they feeding me
I can't keep falling no no no
This shit is deeper than you think

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
I took 1 step forward and got knocked back 2
Point blank complain but I'm not that dude
Like CNN we can't just talk about bad news
I'm talking to my real friends making asshole moves
This shit is comedy
I was too focus on the conglomery
Instead of them percentages when the pack came through
Learned lesson loyalty will have you burn bridges
Hard feelings turned to full confirm pressure
Wait a minute
Learning the business and I can start to feel the tension building
They don't know I'm in my feelings I'm a villain
Ain't no more chilling ain't no more riding no waves
Look at the sky to the only women I praise
I tell 'em
I can not get locked in a cage so I might meet you so
So don't act like I won't kick you in your stomach and burst your fucking apendix
Lost hope can always be reinvented
I know one thing

[Hook: Dizzy Wright & Chelle]
I can't keep falling for the bullshit that they feeding me
I can't keep falling no no no
I can't keep falling no no no
I can't keep falling for the bullshit that they feeding me
I can't keep falling no no no
This shit is deeper than you think

[Outro: Chelle]
I can't keep falling for this shit they feeding me
I can't keep falling for this shit they feeding me
