[Intro:]
(It's as if he was awake but in a dream
Awake in a dream
A dream within a dream
A dream a  gate between the stars
A gate between the stars that brought him back to a world
No longer is a man, no longer is a man) [?]
Hope you have a good day
Hope you're smiling this morning
Yeah
Then throw down own o wow o wow
You have a good day

[Verse 1:]
She wake up late to work
Get up and make it work
Quick on hotels irritated but still the ladies first
She know she need some work
Quickly was acting wrong
And self-improvement is the movement we can't live alone
She good to reason with
She hide and need the shit
She know the biggest shit she actually gotta be legit
I hear her breathing hard, when I ain't been waking up
And I just can't see it all, but I don't wanna be involved
It's the little things I happen to see
Without you noticing I see you practicing what we preach
So when you look over that's the reason I'm acting in sleep
Cause being you is what I'm happy to see
So this might remind of you

[Hook:]
You you, do-do dou-dou-dou-doubt
Hope you have a good day
I hope you have a good day
Do do doubt doubt I doubt I doubt about doud oud dou
Have a good day, good day

[Verse 2:]
No time for the games, she roundy with things
She wake up smiling even though she been through a lot of things
She cherish her life, sleeps scared through the night
Prepare for the fight cause you're such a queen
No making believe you was real as they come, right?
Tell 'em take it to leave it, cause you're getting it done
Look! Check you out! Will you be stepping out
You know you're cute but niggas X it out (you know what I mean?)
I got a thing for you, I wanna sing for you
Like do do do do do
The Frankie Beverly flow so, what can I say?
Here's some soul for you to have a good day
I hope you're smiling

[Hook:]
You you, do-do dou-dou-dou-doubt
Hope you have a good day
I hope you have a good day
Do do doubt doubt I doubt I doubt about doud oud dou
Have a good day, good day

[Verse 3:]
The world is better with you
Don't let these niggas get you
This mission diss you, make you feel unofficial
People come with issues, what you're learning from?
Long as you're happy that ain't concerning that's how they hear you burning up
You need to bring the temperature down
A broken heart is just a room, you carry with it in style
Oh shit, mama knows she living for now
And you kidding, I grab a hand and then I twist it around
We do the sosa in this bitch she laughing I'm whiling
I can't dance, I just like to see my lady smiling
Fallin' asleep and I'll be true in advance
Motivation for when you wake up and do it again
I hope you know
