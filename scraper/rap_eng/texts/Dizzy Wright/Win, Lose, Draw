[Intro]
This is the main event of the evening
It's time!

[Chorus: Demrick]
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I ball
All I tell my dogs
Catch me when I fall
All I tell my broad
Is love me when I'm gone
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I fall

[Verse 1: Demrick]
This feel like Vegas at the roulette table when your number hit, wait
This really feel like when you get your re-up and you double it
Or when you give a bad bitch a good dick she fall in love with it
Got that fire green, go and crumble it
Playing pool side on some summer shit
17 Henny botttles later a masterpiece was created
Came a long way from pissy hallways and crackheads in the elevator
And when this drops there's no favors
Don't try to call, got no data
If you wanna show then show the paper
Girl you got neither, no later
Wait up, won't stop til my [?]
Know what this is, flow the sickest
Add it up, no division, know your vision
Niggas living like codependents
[?], rolling with it
High speed no limits
Prime time, no scrimmage
Is she mine? I'm in it
'Bout time I finish, let's get it

[Chorus: Demrick]
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I ball
All I tell my dogs
Catch me when I fall
All I tell my broad
Is love me when I'm gone
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I fall

[Bridge: Demrick]
Thought they knocked me off, I made my way back
I'm coming for you niggas, that's a payback
All them dues you talk about, I paid that
From the Benz to the Range to the Maybach
Thought they knocked me off, I made my way back
I'm coming for you niggas, that's a payback
All them dues you talk about, I paid that
From the Benz to the Range to the Maybach

[Chorus: Demrick]
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I ball
All I tell my dogs
Catch me when I fall
All I tell my broad
Is love me when I'm gone
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I fall

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Fuck them hoes, I never sweat it
Cause we real hippies, that's level headed
Some niggas forever stressing
Used to be the same way now we better at it
I focus on what's right in front of me
Working on it, working hard
But I wanna let y'all know I ain't where I want to be
Intellect less yes
I don't fuck with that but show these niggas comedy
Real thorough, love me when I'm gone
Peace to the family and honesty
Playing dominoes talking 'bout if man'll manifest a girl, I'm drama free
On everything I keep the queen going
Ass fat, how she fit them jeans on it?
I'ma lean on it then I...

[Chorus: Demrick]
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I ball
All I tell my dogs
Catch me when I fall
All I tell my broad
Is love me when I'm gone
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I fall
