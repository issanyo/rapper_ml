[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
Me and the stoners tryna blaze

[Verse 1: Berner]
Real smoking vibe
Cookie go to mochi high
I want you to tell me "Bern, you winnin'"
I hope they right
I lost a bundle, it's a struggle when you overnight
I told her "get lost, be a hoe for life"
I hope all my ex-bitches still know they mine
They know
You know they lyin'
They don't grow, they ain't ever had a clone of mine
California weed, in another continent (UK)
Pull out my bag, all I get is compliments
They know that shit, is fuckin' with your confidence
Get it out of town, break it down for the college kids
[B-Real]
Leanin' backwards, I hit the Lemonade
Don't touch or you'll catch a fade
No shade, set the pool before game is played
No excuses when the hammer drops, fade away
Ladies sway from a breeze, call 'em Cali trees
And we don't leave em 'til you pay a fee (Pay up)
With the, nominees for the best strain, the head bang
In a daze in the West mayne with best thang
Smokin', yeah, you know we got it
Pack light, yeah, we livin' kush, you want it
We can give it
Now it's time to legalize
Nation wide, Mary Jane on the rise

[Hook X2: Dizzy Wright]
It's rainin' with the vibes in the room
I'm feelin' maybe, tryna' blaze
It's way too vibey in the room
Me and the stoners tryna' blaze

[Verse 2: Berner & B-Real]
[Berner]
The best strains give you chest pains
Big glass tip, smoke thick, out West mayne
Mother plants in the minivan
Weed grow big up North, I got plenty land (True)
I keep cute white bitches to trim
I can tell when it's dry by the snap of a stem
I blow Cookies with Cam, the bag pill is the same
They say I'm old school, I guess I'm just stuck in my ways
[B-Real]
In Summer, still stuck on a haze
Break it up, roll it up, and stayin' ready to blaze
Got a pack in the back, I'm sure it'll amaze
Shatter drippin' when we run it, got you thirsty for days
California medication got you spacin', how's the fire tastin'?
Got you gassed up, fuckin' wasted, but you keep blazin'
You couldn't stop it if you wanted, flavor so addictive
You can't resist it, you'll be beggin' me to fuckin' twist it

[Hook X2: Dizzy Wright]
It's rainin' with the vibes in the room
I'm feelin' maybe, tryna' blaze
It's way too vibey in the room
Me and the stoners tryna' blaze

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
I came home with the goodie bag (Right)
Just to see that Berner sent a Cookie pack (Yee)
Cheese cream, rollin' a bag, woodie wrap
I rolled a joint and then I took a dab (Dab)
My levels is levels above your highest
Don't ask me why I talk about weed if it make us united
Rollin' relaxed, that airflow to the max
That Tony Greenhand bad daddy rolled in the high times, Kush
Then I seen her die with a sign up that said "Free the weed"
Send the next to a dime Kush
I dropped a hundred dollar bill on 'em
Give 'em some dizzy OG and weed and havin' a real moment
It's really true, everyday you learn somethin' new
That's the homie with a job with my patna that grow Gorilla Glue
A year later he was bumpin' that Prohibition 2
Told me Berner & B-Real better get at you
'Cause when you come around

[Hook X2: Dizzy Wright]
It's rainin' with the vibes in the room
I'm feelin' maybe, tryna' blaze
It's way too vibey in the room
Me and the stoners tryna' blaze
