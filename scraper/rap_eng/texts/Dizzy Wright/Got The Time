I ain't Got the Time, I ain't Got the Time (No you don't)
I ain't Got the Time, I ain't Got the Time (Let them know)
They be showing signs, I ain't Got the Time (Get out my way)
If it ain't 'bout that bread don't be hittin' my line (Hit my line)

[Verse 1]
Dizzy hippy get it going
Hittin' donuts in the open
Going global with the motive
I ain't never high and never foldin'
Money comin' and it's loaded
Guaranteed you see me rollin'
You heard my loyalty it was stolen
702 we in motion let's get it!
That Dizzy get it litty litty rap
Givin' my city a piggy back
Married to the game but it gotta a little turned for a special kitty cat
Pin it down until you feel attached, hit it from the back and go deep on it
Let one off, and didn't want to talk and now she talkin' me into a sleep over
But I ain't Got the Time, I ain't Got the Time
She be tryin' and I be lyin' to say I don't play with her mind, shame on me
Right when there ain't no beat, hit me with the same old heat, came in peace
But I feel like she trip so I always break that lease
Moving, moving, moving, moving, moving on
Fuck the kid shit, I got two at home
Fuck you nigga with the cheap cologne
Fuck you and all of your Louis Vuitton
Nigga you want Nigga you wrong
If you don't fuck wit me than leave me alone
We trap on Sahara and Sloan
We feeding these people these songs
Get off my phone cause nigga

I ain't Got the Time, I ain't Got the Time (No you don't)

They be showing signs, I ain't Got the Time (Get out my way)
If it ain't 'bout that bread don't be hittin' my line (Hit my line)

[Verse 2]
One love, on me
Still tryin' to spread them Good Vibes
Ain't got time for the bullshit
I ate a fake bitch with a good body
I'm more confident when I look fly
So every where I go I gotta style on 'em
Ahead of these niggas got a mile on 'em
MJ flew game, with a towel on 'em
Hard work, pays off, this is a packed out party
Little nigga tried to take my weed
So I had to trip like Scotty
Back in action like I left the game
Know I will never leave, and I will never change
But I couldn't know what she was tryin' to gain
So why you playin' games tryin' to show your body
It's too real out here in Vegas
Gettin' into the money makin' habit
See me on the Strip gettin' Faded
Lookin' for, Lookin' for, Lookin' for, Lookin' for
Brand new, brand new sugardaddy
Brand new whip got 'em lookin' at me
But Ion got time for the turnt down
Good weed gotta get burnt down
Feelin' blessed that I'm alive
I've been riding down to 95 since 1995
I swear to you I never lie
It ain't no reason, it's my season to get them points in
Catchin' up and get them joints in
Takin' bitches from their boyfriends
I thought about it but

I ain't Got the Time, I ain't Got the Time (No you don't)
I ain't Got the Time, I ain't Got the Time (Let them know)
They be showing signs, I ain't Got the Time (Get out my way)
If it ain't 'bout that bread don't be hittin' my line (Hit my line)
