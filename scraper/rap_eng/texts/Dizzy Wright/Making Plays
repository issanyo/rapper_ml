[Dizzy Wright]
It's 10:45 nigga
Early, nigga...anytime, nigga, anytime

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Woke up feeling weird from the night before
Once again, then it got me driving slow
Pulling up on my responsibilities
Trying to find the energy to not let the last night drama show
I guess this is what they call the domino effect
Changed my life when I seen these niggas profit from less
Either you real or fugazy, this is not a request
If that don't do it for you, dog, then they can follow your steps
Time traveling, with some 2010 savages
Ya'll better not call me until the decade change
Always in the A like a smart students essay came
By 2020 the lyrics he made the world death ray change
Boy, them high hopes
I know I kill em' with kindness, but I can't always accomplish the right goals
I ain't perfect when it come to the playbooks and nightsoul[?]
I'm planting seeds to see my life grow you know I got to..

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Work like I ain't got long (got long)
You know what my mind on (mind on)
Saving up stacks for my kids
Everyday, I'm makin' plays on my iPhone
Be yourself, that's the only way to live
Told em' right on (right on)
You know what my mind on (mind on)
Saving up stacks for my kids
Everyday, I'm makin' plays on my iPhone
Be yourself that's the only way to live

[Verse 2: AD]
Dizzy Wright, Imma kill these niggas, give me the mic
Before we had the whippers, we was in hood with minibikes
Slidin' on them bitches, showboat banging, just give me the lighter
I always them ends, but I do my thing down in any fight
I ain't glorifying, my teen years was mortifying
We was holdin' iron, then my homies started dyin'
I was out there stressin' off the Hen [?]
Robbin' out them houses I ain't want to go inside
Look, be yourself, be your label, I'm about to feed myself
Puffin' on the gas, King Moses, give me the weed to shelf
I ain't seen nobody 'round when I needed help
I don't fuckin' hand with these fakes, Imma keep my wealth
Told my mama I was gon' do it
Flowing ain't come natural, I ain't forcin' the fluid
Look, either way, you better move it
Keep the 40 on me and I ain't afraid to use it
Wait a minute

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Work like I ain't got long (got long)
You know what my mind on (mind on)
Saving up stacks for my kids
Everyday, I'm makin' plays on my iPhone
Be yourself, that's the only way to live
Told em' right on (right on)
You know what my mind on (mind on)
Saving up stacks for my kids
Everyday, I'm makin' plays on my iPhone
Be yourself that's the only way to live
