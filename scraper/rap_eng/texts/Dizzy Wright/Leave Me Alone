[Hook]
I got problems and my lights off for the night
Can you please just leave me alone? (alone, alone.)
I'm tired, man I'm sick and tired
I just need to be on my own
So won't you leave me alone?
So I can work this out
Won't you leave me alone
I feel like I am all worked out
Won't you leave me alone
I'm tired, man I'm sick and tired
I just need to be on my own
So won't you leave me alone

[Verse 1]
I'm trying to stay positive so I will never fall
So I'm smoking on this roof like it set it off
I'm trying to calm my nerves, but that's no excuse
But you will never understand what I am going through
I'm trying to keep it cool, but I guess I'm fake now
But I'm only fake cause I'm giving out these fake smiles
So it hurts more, my momma said;
Keep a hand on your shoulders you always get what you work for
So I'm grinding like an assignment due tomorrow
All this shit on my plate
I swear its more than you could swallow, nobody likes to follow;
Something they can't relate with
I look around, and it seems we all on the same shit.(true)
All these problems, but I'm only spitting some of it
The world is full of suffering, but also overcoming it.(it is)
The dumbest shit always bothers me,(why)
But if you knew how hard it be you would know that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to do good, but they looking for the bad in me.(Yep)
And those same niggas be on the net adding me.(Right)
And words don't hurt but verbally they attacking me.(Why?)
I'm so focused but they keep on distracting me.(True)
Happily, I just keep it moving and brush them off
But so much weight on my shoulder I'm bout to fucking fall
Shit, nigga fuck them all,(Fuck them all)
That's what Miles told me.(True)
I'm unhappy so I need someone to smile for me.(Why)
On some depressing shit, I'm spitting out that lesson shit
Fake niggas don't even really know what a confession is.(They don't)
But I ain't tripping though,(No)
Niggas hating on me, tell me is you kidding bro
What the fuck you living for?(Damn)
Listen bro, nothing better to do?
Hating on me cause a nigga doing better than you?
Something I would never do
So here's a note to them all
I'm living like there is no tomorrow
Cause a nigga got problems

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Man, I got problems, I'm so sick and tired
World full of fakes, I'm so sick of liars
Niggas feeding me dreams, getting my hopes up
These lames is getting clearer, I'm getting a close up
I'm walking through this life, trying to be where ever money at
Where's Sunny at, filled with funny cats,
Niggas who don't pay dues, they want their money back
Hard work equals success, then let the money stack
So falling off, nah nigga not I
I swear to Vibe I'm number one in my top five
I got faith in myself, hate in myself
Now I'm working hard to place in the wealth
But sometimes a nigga just wanna be alone
Stressing daily, makes it hard to stay strong
Very small team and we done did it on our own
So tonight can you please just leave us the fuck alone?
