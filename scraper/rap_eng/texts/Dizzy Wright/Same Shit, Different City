[Verse 1: Legacy]
Uh, uh, Hoes in the club, scared to get wet like toes in the tub
Giver her a drink and her souls in the cup what's in there?
Potion and stuff...
She enjoys it too, like this is why I was avoiding you
She say she with this one boy in school
Showed her my dick she like "boyfriend who?"
She grab some girls and we walk so like we running with three now
I ain't know rappers had lock outs they tryna take the whole team down
At the suite like blow fuck bein shallow better deepthroat now
Hotel neighbors say she screamed so loud
Blastin rock and heard three doors down
Get it, get it thank you babe
I'mma handle that ass like the breaks are dead
I got the brinks shield on my cock you canâ€™t take the dick
She play hard to get then play get it hard
Then drove home in her niggas car
Like I hope you don't kiss me takin her out
I'm a tooth, came in her mouth

[Hook]
Ain't shit different but they way they speak
Thats why I don't trust these women from the day we meet
Ain't, ain't shit different but they way they speak
Thats why I dont trust these women from the day we meet

[Verse 2: Ben J]
Clubin everyone looking good bar tender pour them drinks
Bumpin, put your cups up tell the DJ play that beat
Drop top, this girl tellin me how niggas is scandalous
Bullshit, talkin bout when your girl drunk you can't trust that bitch
She think cause she in the vip she about to be on
But what she know? that girl hanging around my bros
She look good and they know
Ohh she feeling herself
She about to spill her cup
She too good for a little bit of help
Girls get drunk and then forget about you
Want to sit by and niggas buying them drinks and little weed supplying
Y'all lose y'all mind so you can't remind em
Them chino hills and some drinks
This the second out you can't rely on them
I know her inner freak
She tryna walk with me cause she know I'm balling

[Hook]
Ain't shit different but they way they speak
Thats why I don't trust these women from the day we meet
Ain't, ain't shit different but they way they speak
Thats why I dont trust these women from the day we meet

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
I tried to tell these niggas
I was 'gone be winning
Independent livin
Turned my vision to my mission
Did my groundwork took my instance
Turned my dreams into my business
And my business make a killing
Bitch I'm heading for a million
I put vegas on the map
Tattoos on my skin
Bitch I got Vegas on my tatts
702 nigga lets go in
I'm on my shit for a while now nigga pow pow bow bow
Y'all niggas dont wanna get it on
Ship that beat heat it up eat it up
I seen enough of the luck
I'mma show 'em who raw (who raw)
Nigga who want it
Four in the morning my nigga just brought us a bottle
Vegas shit so every city I hit just 24 hours
What's your reality?
Me? I'm living fast killing jams, stealing fans
Higher than a mother fucking ceiling fan
And I'm still the man
