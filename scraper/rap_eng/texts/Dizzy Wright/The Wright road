[Intro]
If I could do it like every nigga that did it would you name me as the mother fucking greatest
If I could do it like every nigga that did it would you name me as the mother fucking greatest
And I say..

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Man fuck the world
I done stayed strong
I done did this shit, I done came this far all on my own
I'm never selling my soul, I'm still in control, the Wright road road, the Wright road

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I'm ready for more, I came up in this bitch and I'm ready for war
I'm coming from the bottom and I'm hungry so if you get in my way I swear to God I'mma rip you apart
I'm a mother fucking animal, rapping faster than ever and making that shit understandable
Legend in the making lemme sample you, the Wright road is my avenue, I do what I have to do
Twenty years old with the soul of an old man, nigga lost mine, wanna come and hold hands
Join in and we can be a movement, do big things, and probably shoot a movie
Nigga quit with all the lies, your probably sitting on your ass talking about it right now
I'ma be the one to call it bullshit out and if you get loud I'mma punch you in the God damn mouth
And that's real..

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
He coming out of Vegas, oh my God did that nigga really make it
They say Hip-Hop's dead, well if its dead I'm retaliation
I'm ready for blood, show no love, I ain't holding back, put racks on racks on racks on this track and this niggas wack
I hate that you niggas in the front and I'm in the back and I ain't hatin' I just should be where you at
I feel like I could be the greatest, you was a Tribe Called Quest to a Tribe Called Vegas
East-side where I'm at to be exact, but I'm reppin' for the whole damn nation
I'm the voice of your worst words, you got God in your name, your a God damn fool
There's only one god and that ain't you so whoever is fucking with you is a God damn fool

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
He a poet, he the coldest, he the dopest
God damn that nigga Dizzy Wright real
I ain't gone change but I know that my live will
Looking for the real, it's right here
I don't ever need to floss, I'm going in, I'm going off
I ain't going Hollywood, you going soft
Niggas think I'm ballin
But I'm just maintaining, making ends
Tryna give it my all
I got a couple niggas with me and we baptized
Smoke weed, never focus on the bad guys
Throw it up if ya see me when I pass by, you don't gotta hide behind the mask ma
I open this lane for you, you, you, and you, and you
Doin you, fuck what you been through
This the beginning to the new, walk the wright road, in the wright shoes. And they say

[Chorus]
