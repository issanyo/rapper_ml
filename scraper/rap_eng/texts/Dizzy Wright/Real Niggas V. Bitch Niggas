Real niggas don't be bragging bout they cash
They just let the money stack and fill the world

And you gonna have to pick nigga
Its gon' be real niggas vs. bitch niggas [x3]
And you gonna have to pick nigga

[Verse 1]
Look, in my own world
You can tell I'm in deep thought
See I preach talk and my bigga nigga C-Wok
Teaching me to be street smart
Instead of a thug
Since rapping was my passion they
Respected what I was
See I never tried to be somebody I wasn't
These pussy niggas talk to me like they
Be really thuggin
Ignorance is bliss my nigga, yous really frontin
Your negative energy has really got me in the need of somethin
I hope the weed is coming
Because your visuals are becoming predictable
That now I see the bitch in you, see niggas like you
Always lie about what they do
So even when your not lyin its still don't sound like the truth
See even as a youth I was the realest in the booth
But my mamma raised a man
So I try to keep it cool, keep it true
Keep it real, keep it trill, keep it lit, nigga
Yeah, ol' bitch ass nigga

[Hook]
Real niggas dont be bragging bout they cash
They just let the money stack and fill the world
With this honesty
Bitch niggas always gassin bout they action
How they always getting active when they know
Nothing about the streets

Its gonn' be Real niggas v. Bitch niggas [x3]
And you gonna have to pick nigga
Its gonn' be Real niggas v. Bitch niggas [x3]
And you gonna have to pick nigga

[Verse 2]
Look, shits gettin depressin to be seein my people
So reckless cause they be pressin all these bitch ass
Niggas who stay flexin
Now these niggas stressin, but ain't nobody laughing
Real niggas dont run around and talk about who they be clapping
See thats distraction, so why you niggas actin?
Tryna get in trouble? we tryna stay out of caskets
They say the world ending but I dont think its gonna happen
But if it do I hope the next world get to hear me rappin
Passion, loyalty, glorious, and honesty bitch ass nigga
Thats some real nigga qualities
Mamma say she proud of me, so Im on this balcony
Overlooking my fears, appreciate whats surrounding me
Yeah, my brother down in the county G and all the dreams
He had the whole world found in me
So now I'm grinding for the both of us, ain't nobody close as us
Now they got a real nigga blowing up

[Hook]
Real niggas don't be bragging bout they cash
They just let the money stack and fill the world
With this honesty
Bitch niggas always gassing bout they action
How they always getting active when they know
Nothing about the streets

Its gonn' be Real niggas v. Bitch niggas [x3]
And you gonna have to pick nigga
Its gonn' be Real niggas v. Bitch niggas [x3]
And you gonna have to pick nigga

[Verse 3]
So if you listen and you feel like I am talking to you
I got bad news my nigga, I am talking to you
Cause you got bitch nigga qualities and the
Heart of a dude, so you be talking it up
But never walked in his shoes
I hate motherfuckers who hate motherfuckers for no reason
But being a bitch nigga these days, is so easy
Stop it
Fuck who you got problems with, go tweet this shit
Subliminal. Or formspring anonymous cause you
Don't got the balls to stand tall with some confidence
Fucking Carltons, sit down before I smack you
Real nigga talking, doing a real nigga job
So when you see me in your hood
Give me that real nigga nod
We ain't never gotta shake, we ain't never gotta face
Cause real recognize real
And I ain't never made a mistake
I do this for the Veg, I do this for the kids
You do this for the fame and I do it for what's real
You a bitch ass nigga
