Wisdom's better than silver and gold
So you better take these good vibes with you and go hit that road
Learned the hardest things in the world to do was let go
But if you knew then what you know now
You probably would've taken things slow
I know
You are the universe
You deserve the universe
I know, I know
You are the universe
Yes, you deserve the universe
Don't let 'em change your mind
You are the universe
You deserve the universe
Go let the whole world know
I'm back, I'm better baby
