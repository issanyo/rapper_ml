[Verse 1: ]
Hopping off my plane, finna grab my bag
Running on my main, 'bout to jump in the cab
She always be late, and she saying she trying to drive fast
She better not crash
Over here waiting on you sitting out of commission
She said chill out my nigga just kick it
Cause lord knows I don't need another ticket
Well I traveled the distance
Now I'm back home back in business
So I'm kinda impatient
So I'm a hit the weed man and make arrangements
I'm just tired of the waiting so my attitude is changing
She like stop the complaining
I swear I'm not leaving you hanging
We gon' pick up the trees, just sit in yo' seat
Okay, now you talking my language
I've been on tour for so long, adapted habits
Back home, now it's back to dabbing
Sorry if you see me act dramatic
She told me relax the madness
How you acting?
She like fuck it you've been on the road
A nigga in one of them modes
His motions is being exposed
But fuck it, in 24 hours I'm gone
Well I'm trying to be yours when you ain't right
Changed flights through the lay-overs
Came back and its all good
Cause you look good well you might as well stay old
Came back from a takeover
If you had a chance with me, well its looking like its probably too late for you
She said I understand what rapping do
But I ain't feeding off your attitude
And I'm a need you to

[Hook :]
Calm down and let me get you high
See you looking for a reason to be mad, but I don't know why
Keep it real you been salty all day and you can't even lie
Cause dawg you been complaining all day
I done ran out everything that I can say
I'm a need you to calm down
I'm a need you to calm down and relax a little
I'm a need you to calm down
I'm a need you to calm down and relax a little
Yeah you really need to calm down
I'm a need you to calm down and relax a little
Cause dawg you been complaining all day
I done ran out everything that I can say

[Verse 2: ]
I'm a need you to calm down, relax a little
Maybe you just over thinking it
You fighting the old while you building a new
Go for that shit while you dreaming it
When you talk all that negative shit
Well I'm just like the people you got me believing it
Social media became a joke, and everybody became a comedian
But we in 20 1-4 and its funny
Wasting time is worse than wasting money
Tryna pay all my bills by the monthly
Until they get somebody to Michael Dunn me
And we went from homeless and hungry
To getting this hot meal with these fries
Happy with the smallest things alive
Talking about bitch don't kill my vibe!
Imagine that, we got our own imagination, so me, I think big non-stop
Turning negatives into positives, it's kind of hard and its doing a lot
So what we do? We smoke our pot
Create some new, got to clear my mind
So I don't got to change the old nigga that I am
I just got to create something fly (exactly)
Keep calm when the bad attack me
Even when they nagging at me
Now I gots fans to back me
They been waiting on the grand finale
Me, I'm just living my word, smoking the funk and I'm speaking with value
Turn up the volume, finna hit y'all with a album
'Til then I'm a need you to

[Hook :]
