[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Time was serving at the rodeo
Blessing them with a doobie and a 40 oz
Funny I used to know me as that nigga running round
Now I'm getting it and I ain't even holding out (You feel me)
I'm showing loving until it kills me
And I'm sure that's what it will be
Cause niggas ain't gone let me get too powerful (true)
But they gonna fuck with me
See me in the making end
Giving life to the hands that I'm shaking
As I'm controlling crowds
Rapping my facts ecstatic for that
They try to hold you down
Be happy you back
Taking advantage of the freedom we was given
If you get it you will listen
Before you ever have to live it
But if your niggas got you fucking up (Them ain't your niggas)
I could sense a little fix when I came into the picture
Put you nigga on his phone
Get used to it then put it away
No time for play
Time to get in the zone

[Hook: Arima Ederra & Dizzy Wright]
That's the way love goes
That's the way that love goes baby
Since you been gone we been coming strong
I'm finna put you on, my nigga home
That's the way love goes
That's the way that love goes baby
Since you been gone we been coming strong
Or finna put you on like welcome home

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
I just met my father for the first time
Him being missing made me embrace mine
Well now this Funk Volume shit is just
A little more than rapping and collabing
Cause it got me to finally meet my Daddy
I wonder what the nigga be like
Is he focused, is he hustling
Can he hang in a discussion
Got off the plane
Seen him and shook his hand
Like it was nothing
Nigga why you fronting
You was happy as shit (Ahhhhh)
Smile on my face
Learned how to be great
Be better than me
Just try every day
Words of wisdom
I ain't rapping the same
This shit tat on my skin
That's the shit he had on his brain
So now you battle with chains
They rattle your name
20 years is too long to be acting the same
But since you
Back in the game and back on the streets
Well I wonder if it happen to me

[Hook: Arima Ederra & Dizzy Wright]
That's the way love goes
That's the way that love goes baby
Since you been gone we been coming strong
Finna put you on, Pops welcome home
That's the way love goes
That's the way that love goes baby
Since you been gone we been coming strong
Finna put you on, Pops welcome home
