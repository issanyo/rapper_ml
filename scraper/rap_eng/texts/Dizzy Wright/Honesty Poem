[Verse 1]

Is...being honest always the way to go?
You lie cause you don't wanna let em go, but you wanna let em know, that you're not just the average joe
Inside's burning from the pain you may feel
From her first reaction and you walkin down the lane to be real
To be honest, to be everything she asks for
To be the color to her sky in her rim to her backboard
But you go back and forth thinking if honesty is the right way to go
Cause the object is to keep her and not see her turn and walk out that door
But you wanna show her you're honest and that you're trying to make it through round one
But just like they say don't ask the questions if you don't wanna know the answer
Why be honest if you don't wanna know the outcome?
Now, I done had my share with women, share some women, hell, scared of women
But of also bare with women who compare attention needed only to repair some women
Now, I'm realizing that honesty from the words of the lips can emerge like a fist, smack you
And have you feeling lower then ever
You can be closer to never when you lie
So why be honest and lose when you can be happy and hide?
It's like setting yourself up for failure, setting yourself up for destruction
Stressin', cryin', laying in the bed thinking about nothing
Catching the emotional case staring off in space, getting on myspace just to see if they took you off there top
Cause you don't wanna do it, but you don't wanna be the first
And you also don't wanna be like every man, but you don't wanna be the curse
See, women are the verse to the most unique sound we all cherish
And when you find them set of words that you enjoy being honest is helpless
That's what we tend to think when we're honest and lose
So women if you don't like the truth don't ask for a honest dude
Understand that a man comes a dime a doz'
And, just because I have a mind of love doesn't mean I'm gonna wine and dine you up
Just respect what you ask for and we'll be alright
And when I'm honest and it's a problem, respect when I lie
Is being honest really worth it?
