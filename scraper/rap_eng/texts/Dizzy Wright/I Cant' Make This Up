[Intro]
Can't make this up, shit don't happen over night, ya know what I mean?

[Hook]
Yo, I've done pay my dues I can't make this up
I'm out here busting moves I can't make this up
Nigga, this don't come with luck man, I can't make this up
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed

[Verse 1]
Yo, I've been going so hard and all my niggas with me
I'm smoking in my hotel, drinking that Bama juice
Yo, everyday I'm waking up in a different city
Yeah, sold out shows everywhere, shout out my camera dude
Y'all don't know my name, nigga y'all don't know my name
But Y'all gonna learn about, Y'all gonna learn about it
Yo, all my life man, all I wanted was to be great
And now it's in my hands and make 'em talk about it
Yea, swerving off that Henny, but I'm still observant
But I be on some G shit when we meet in person
I was on a million dollar tour how can I make this up?
Opening up for Logic, tryin' to make a cut

[Hook]
Yo, I've done pay my dues I can't make this up
I'm out here busting moves I can't make this up
Nigga, this don't come with luck man, I can't make this up
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm gettin' crazy love
Yo, I've done pay my dues I can't make this up
I'm out here busting moves I can't make this up
Nigga, this don't come with luck man, I can't make this up
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed

[Verse 2]
60 days on tour man, I've been on a journey
Election day is coming, hope you vote for Bernie
Go vote this shit, go vote this shit, go vote this shit
Cause marijuana can't keep bringing the police here
The world gon' know my name, they world gon' know my name
Whether it's my music or my Mary Jane
And if you do not smoke, don't be no hoe about it
We fighting war on drugs and they make money off it
We need to feed the homeless, need to feed the homeless
All this money we making we can't even clothe 'em
All I ever wanted to do was inspire
And now I'm just a fighter playing with the fire
I just blaze that tree up when I'm aggravated
And I kill them with kindness while I'm navigated
Flint to Vegas, Flint to Vegas that's my title
My album on the way it just might drop on Tidal

[Hook]
Yo, I've done pay my dues I can't make this up
I'm out here busting moves I can't make this up
Nigga, this don't come with luck man, I can't make this up
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm gettin' crazy love
Yo, I've done pay my dues I can't make this up
I'm out here busting moves I can't make this up
Nigga, this don't come with luck man, I can't make this up
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed
