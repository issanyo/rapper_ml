[Intro]
Uhh Uhh

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
All my life I've been judged
All my life I've been put down
You sacrifice and I ask for life
Living life right now as the good child
I put in work, discovered real
Stuck and fucked in a fucked up deal
Lucked up still, got up out of this shit
Slap the pussy with the side of my dick
I've been on my grind, for my child
Made me proud to be part of a blessing
Rizzo locked up, baby mama knocked up
Now he dealing with another nigga connection
Man I'm stressing, man I'm smokin'
Looking at life from a different perspective
Man I'm growing, these niggas' is hating
And now I walk around and I stay protected
I ain't thugging, I ain't sold a brick
I ain't on stage tryna hold my dick
I'm outta town I got a show to give
I'm from where the broke niggas had to show me shit
I ain't scared, I know what I'm worth
Hide my pain, in my purp put my soul all in my verse
I got 4 or 5 niggas that done see me learn and still moving

[Hook x2]
Hold up, slow down
Team work make the dream work
I seen good and I seen dirt
You're all in when the dream work (Fuck that!)

[Verse 2]
They predict for all of my niggas we'd be dead on drugs or in the pen
Use the pen with some juice and Gin take it on your brains in the midst of sin
I keep faith, even when I fight myself
Bring me down and get beside myself
The hardest critic is the niggas that's spittin
All of these lyrics lil nigga tryna find himself
Shit, Time will tell, I might as well
I got a soul I ain't tryna sell
I came from the bottom, tired of all the problems
Looking for a way cus I spent a little time in hell...God damn
Lost soul with a wrong crowd, bad mix with a bad bitch
Distracted by all of the good, settle for the hood
We gon' see how fucking far these dub sacks get
Still move

[Hook x2]
Hold up, slow down
Team work make the dream work
I seen good and I seen dirt
You're all in when the dream work (Fuck that!)

[Verse 3]
I'm living in my own world, Accomplished shit but I want some more
Open doors for my city bitch I'm tryna live like the Huxtables
I'm comfortable, I ain't changing ho
Bag of weed and a change of clothes
You got a momma and a daddy, acting crazy with your friends
You a phony lil nigga, what you banging for
I'm calling out all fuck shit, fuck boy don't act surprised
Killing rappers, y'all practice guys
Sick of all these squares, fakes come in package size
I'm screaming out team work make the dream work
The dream work when the team in it
Sound good but it is good, smoking on some good
You can smell when the ink it, still moving

[Hook x2]
Hold up, slow down
Team work make the dream work
I seen good and I seen dirt
You're all in when the dream work (Fuck that!)
