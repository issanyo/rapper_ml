[Hook: Demrick]
I done smoked a quarter pound, quarter pound
In 2 days, (2 days, 2 days)
I done smoked a quarter pound, quarter pound
In 2 days, (2 days, 2 days)
I done smoked a quarter pound, quarter pound
In 2 days, (2 days, 2 days)
I done smoked a quarter pound, quarter pound
In 2 days, (2 days, 2 days)

[Verse 1: Jahni Denver]
Higher than astronomics still breathing like aeroponics
Fluid like hydroponics from soil i am the Chronic
Cross-bred with Lemon Tree messages in my melody
Rockin' i caught up in the rapture of rap and Hennessey
Im just a Denver G, MC who be sellin' weed
I let that ganga enter me then Poof, positive energy
Started smoking heavy gregy we was just 11 (11)
Way before the reggie ready we was scrapin' resin (Resin)
Gettin' high off metal pipes filled with Bobby Brown (What)
Now its Dizzy or the Crown by the quarter pound (Aah)
Ya bitch is nowhere to be found when i come in town (Nope)
Stoner chicks, we going up, now she going down
Fuck around with Demrick blowin' 4 in a day
You see me flippin round in foreigns with no 401k
Yea thats right bitch you know we growin' loud
Flipped another 40 pounds
Probably sent it to ya town, and then my nigga

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, i done rolled up 4 zips, in like 2 days
Only take my dabs on low temp but with my mood swings
Man this lifestyle got me drained
Picked up weed off Nellis and Twain
Got a bad one that i fuck with (Right)
But she can't be my main (No)
I done smoke that quarter pound like its nothing so lets capitalize
Make a song then advertise, they sabotage and we satisfied
Eatin good lately, i swear i been havin' this appetite
Now im goin' coast to coast, some call this that travel life
Pass the weed then pass the mic (Let me Ride)
Now im feelin' Woke and Boke
Bad bitch goin pull up on me
Hope she dont hit me with the okey doke
You niggas know we smoke the most
Moski-mo gon' roll that dough
Hit me up when you gettin low
Just read up on mo
I got a bag on me but it won't last homie get hit with the quickness
Jahni Denver rollin up the lift ticket
I land and he pick me up with it and now we ridin' high
Double fistin' rollin through the city that we love to visit
Keep it G and then they thankin' me for comin' wit it
Cuz i done smoke a
