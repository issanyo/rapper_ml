[Hook]
Ever since I was a kid
I wanted mo'
Look at everything I did
I wanted mo'
Niggas always tryna tell me how to live, man
I wanted mo'
Don't disrespect me my G
We gon' get it in 2K16
Cos I always wanted mo'
The grind don't stop, oh no
Man the grind don't stop, oh no
I always wanted mo'
Cos the grind don't stop, oh no
Man the grind don't stop, oh no
I always wanted mo'
Man, I always wanted mo'

[Verse 1]
I always wanted mo' watched a couple nigga's come and go
And had my momma stressed out so I was chillin' at the corner store
With the brodee-bros telling them I gotta be the best out
This more then getting rich but the real shit made them have a melt down
Fuck any nigga saying we ain't held it down
Down running through this bitches doggin finna settle down
Lord knows i need this life tattoos my inspiration that's graffiti life
I'm living the speedy life doing a hundred and twenty while They try and catch me this is a daily ritual
Only nigga headed to the top taking Vegas with him
I'm just trying to be authentic these days
Saving money bitches getting awfully friendly these days
Run it back for the motherfucking instant replay

[Bridge]
Cause ever since I was a kid I had a dream could be the fucking greatest dog
Call me crazy now they are me going crazy hard
You can never kill my spirit when I'm taking charge
Taken off I don't go to sleep till I'm in the clouds
I wanted mo' but love the way I'm living with now
Less stress less pain more money more problems
But the grind don't change let me tell you one thing

[Verse 2]
My nigga what you hating on they say dizzy what you waiting on
I play my part from the start and put smiles on my fans
One man can change everything I don't know how but he can
Reciting and we smoke y'all ain't no fucking fans
My real homies with me telling me to stick with to the plan My vision blurry but fuck it I'm not going to it discourage me
Currently Steph curry going for thirty I'm
Saving my words and letting it breathe
So I can give them everything in one time
Cause I'm precisive and righteous
I'll bite off your ear so you hear me like Tyson
No pressure if you listen to me
Ayo love is what I'm willingly to accept if you gonna give it to me
I always wanted mo I always wanted mo
I always been efficient with the inventory

[Bridge]
But ever since i was a kid i had a dream could be the fucking greatest dog
Call me crazy now they are me going crazy hard
You can never kill my spirit when I'm taking charge
Taken off I don't go to sleep till I'm in the clouds

Less stress less pain more money more problems
But the grind don't change let me tell you one thing
