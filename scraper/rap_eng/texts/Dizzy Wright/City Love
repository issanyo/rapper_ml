[Hook]
Daddy wasn't around, momma needed help
I was in the streets, I was on my grind, I was by myself
I hit these bitches down to hit the kitchen
With ammunition, we gon' grant some wishes
Stripping bitches, show the city love
We just tryna show the city love
Cause daddy wasn't around, momma needed help
I was in the streets, I was on my grind, I was by myself
I hit these bitches down to hit the kitchen
With ammunition, we gon' grant some wishes
Stripping bitches, show the city love
We just tryna show the city love

[Verse 1]
Yo, everybody showing Dizzy hippy love
Pretty bitches always wanna hit the bud
Baby girl, live it up, switch it up
Don't be okay with the minimum
On the whip and on the house
No Jazzy Jeffs, we Uncle Phils and throw 'em out
You can tell 'em I been with the shit boy
Been getting money, all these other niggas watered down
It's all about the fucking drown
Smoking that Dizzy OG til I float around
I ain't know the game but I know it now
Home town hero, let me show you how
Look I never do the city like Ne-Yo (Not at all)
Finna set it off like Cleo
Too talented to be afraid of needles
Smoking weed, I'm hoping they make it legal, cause

[Hook]
Daddy wasn't around, momma needed help
I was in the streets, I was on my grind, I was by myself
I hit these bitches down to hit the kitchen
With ammunition, we gon' grant some wishes
Stripping bitches, show the city love
We just tryna show the city love
Cause daddy wasn't around, momma needed help
I was in the streets, I was on my grind, I was by myself
I hit these bitches down to hit the kitchen
With ammunition, we gon' grant some wishes
Stripping bitches, show the city love
We just tryna show the city love

[Verse 2]
Now these bitches wanna ride the wave
You can flip it and make it a lot of ways
Plotting and scheming is all we do
Lighting that Dizzy OG like it's a holiday
While the enemies bang, we was on before dispensaries came
Stick to the plan
You want it, I got it and got a lot, run it now
Now I gotta go and get it again
Stacking that dough, Cali calling so I'm back and I'm forth
Gas in the tank and I'm back on the road
Packing, don't forget to pack the pre-rolled
You reap what you sow
We paved the way, we came to shut it down
Vegas baby, yeah they love the sound
I run this shit, it ain't too much to clown
Legendary stoner need a hundred thou, cause

Daddy wasn't around, momma needed help

Stripping bitches, show the city love
We just tryna show the city love
