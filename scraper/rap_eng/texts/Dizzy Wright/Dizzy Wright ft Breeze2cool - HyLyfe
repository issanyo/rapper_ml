[Intro:]
Check it out pimp juice
Me and my OG tripple OG Breeze2cool
We done uhh got together and started a new movement for the world
A new culture for the city, it go something like this

[Hook:]


Nigga I'm lifted and feeling gifted
Accepted a mission
With some consequences
I be dealing with these
Shady pretenders
Ladies inventors
Basically all theses daily dilemmas
My weed good
So my mood changing
Flying all over these room
Shit I'm Lu ganging
Feeling better than you
But I got nothing to prove
Playa
I'm independent
But them hylife nigga's to major
You sit at home after a long day
Roll up your blunt
Lit it in up
And handle the situation
How you doing your own way
I do the same
Everybody smoke shit who's the blame
Do you own hopefully do the same
Get off your ass don't try to be someone who you ain't
Don't got can't in my vocabulary
Iv been ready all these industry nigga's acting scary
You wanted the real shit you finally got it
Don't get me seeds in my whips in my knowledge shit I finally got it
