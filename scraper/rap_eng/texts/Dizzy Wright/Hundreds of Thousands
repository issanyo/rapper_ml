Intro
For everybody that likes to get high
And have a good time

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Two step with a blunt in my mouth
Legendary stoner, I am one of them now
On tour I've been running around
I need hundreds and hundreds of thousands
Two step with a blunt in my mouth
Legendary stoner, I am one of them now
On tour I've been running around
I need hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands
I need hundreds and hundreds of thousands
I need hundreds and hundreds of thousands
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands

[Verse 1: Demrick]
I need a hundred thousand fans with their hands high
I'll take a hundred thousand grand for the bad times
And use it to celebrate all them good days
Maintain the same there's no way that I could change
Made it out the hood fade made it on a plane
Out here in L.A. where people bless me with the good strains
That jet fuel flight get it overnight
38 no debate we done changed the price
And that Dizzy OG got me feeling right
I'mma need an OZ just to feed the hype
Best believe I got money on my mind
Put that petty shit down to the side
Light it up one time

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Two step with a blunt in my mouth
Legendary stoner, I am one of them now
On tour I've been running around
I need hundreds and hundreds of thousands
Two step with a blunt in my mouth
Legendary stoner, I am one of them now
On tour I've been running around
I need hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands
I need hundreds and hundreds of thousands
I need hundreds and hundreds of thousands
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
The whole world want this marijuana legalized
I just wanna make 500K for the needy times
The streets is mine I see this opening lane
I see them smoking my strain, well now it's time to open my shop
I'm feeling motivated, love it or not
Me and the homies finna give y'all something to watch
I'm talking 100 thousand grams that's sold
