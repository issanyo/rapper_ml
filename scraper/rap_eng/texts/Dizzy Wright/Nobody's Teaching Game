[Intro]
Uhh
Dizzy Wright nigga

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I told my mama this is me until my dying day
I'ma educate roll this weed and I'mma fly away
I'm blunted keep it three hundred I done found my place
This sound the fake is all around my way
But I just keep to myself that ain't no harm is it?
I'm about my business so I keep niggas at arms distance
These niggas iffy, money make a nigga move quickly
Couple dollars and now he want to go and hit this city
No way he strugglin but that money speed on getting bitches
Spending your gas money on different mission
This niggas fool these bitches pimpin niggas
Y'all got the game twisted, better decisions when I'm living
Get it my own I can't be sick
I'm testing my awesome ability surrounded by positive energy
My nigga the industry is fucking letting me down
I'm looking around like damn, these are idols?
People faces with these titles ain't no point of sticking around
Nigga I'm out, nobody teaching game

[Hook:Dizzy Wright]
Ain't nobody teaching us the game
So we had to learn the game on our own
Judging body teaching lesson bout nothing
I can't even tell my right from my wrong
Ain't nothing natural everything is in the back
One day if we speed it the last of time
So I'm working harder cause I did it god damned
If I just let time just pass me by
Nobody teaching us nothing

[Verse 2: Capo Young]
Yeah we know too much to try to hole out
Holding on your flash it can't even let your soul out
I share silent cries, those who took the ho route
I wonder if you see some shit that day
Babies know what that about
But I ain't trying judge cause I din't do my dirt
But I'm just speaking up cause I I don't wanna see you hurt
Let me tell you bout my dreams
Cause I don't see the worst
From Malcom X murder too me inside the hearse and
We just think we need a resolution
It's evident that we ain't solved a shit
Where we've been shooting
You want your chains and your whips shit
Get when you ride
But can't take none of the witch when you die
Gotta get back on my soul, gotta stay up on my mind
Gotta do me cause this niggas they pay a fee to see me be weak
I got my passion in my veins my God inside my soul blunt
Roll writing raps is our struggle

[Hook:Dizzy Wright]
Ain't nobody teaching us the game
So we had to learn the game on our own
Judging body teaching lesson bout nothing
I can't even tell my right from my wrong
Ain't nothing natural everything is in the back
One day if we speed it the last of time
So I'm working harder cause I did it god damn it
If I just let time just pass me by
Nobody teaching us nothing
