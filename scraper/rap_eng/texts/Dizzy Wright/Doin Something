[Chorus]
I guess you think you doin' somethin, doin' somethin
Tryna stand on me, you must've lost your mind
I guess you think you doin' somethin, doin' somethin
You can't stand on me, I do this all the time
I guess you think you doin' somethin, doin' somethin
I don't need your bitch, I make them fall in line
I guess you think you doin' somethin, doin' somethin
You can't do it like me, that's where I draw the line

[Verse 1]
I ain't slow down since my mama kicked me out
