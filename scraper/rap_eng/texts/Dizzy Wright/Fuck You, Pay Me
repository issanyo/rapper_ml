[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, yo, what's poppin' man
It's your young playa partner, Dizzy Wright, man
I'm bringin' you that fly ass young playa, Mike Bars!
Bringin' you that 16 Bars, straight out of Portland!
Y'all better show love and show respect where it's due
I'm out
Peace

Fuck you, pay me x4
Pay x8

[Verse 1]
Back up in my High School
My dad gave me these life rules
He said that I could be anything I found in my dreams
And to pack up is the right move
So I blast something to write to
Thinking, "Rap...that's what I might do!"
When the Principal takes my pencil, and then goes:
"Don't you know that you're white, dude?
What about your IQ?
Think about your life, too"
I said, "Call my parents house!
All I care about's mall apparel and nice jewels!
I don't even act hard
But I'mma be a rap star
A hot shot at the chop shop
With a drop top - once im done with my Dad's car"
The principal snapped like, "Go home, player"
I did just that, and made 'Grown Folks' later
Now I'm so cold when flow that I don't know
If I'll poke holes in the Ozone layer
And the same chicks who ain't looked twice
Wanna bang dick for this good life
They said left, so I pushed right
Now I get checks like I'm Suge Knight

[Hook]
When I was a kid, they said I would fail
"You'll never blow up, it's time to get real"
But now I'm grown up, and they all wanna chill
But I'll never forget all the shit you put me through, like:
When I was a kid, you said I would fail
I'll never blow up, it's time to get real
But now I'm grown up, and just look at 'em kneel
But I'll never forget all the shit you put me through, so

Fuck you, pay me x4
Pay x8

[Verse 2]
Way before I produced a beat
I was up in a booster seat
Looking down on the rest of the kids
Knowing none of 'em would ever be as smooth as me
But that's how it used to be
See, now I got more style than Gangnam
And you can find me in the sky
Cause I'll probably be so high
That you look about as fly as a penguin
So even If I get a little bit of shit
For getting rich when it was always glamorous
Least I can pay for the damages
And tell the fellas "Sit back, let me handle this"
Now I'm that blunt smokin', gun totin'
Skinny white rapper that run Portland
And bitch, you know I'mma keep it comin' 'til the whistle blow
Now it's fuck you, pay me, like a gigolo, cause

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They used to say I was bitch made
They used to call me a white nerd
Now I'm all on their chick's brain
Cause my wrists look like an ice berg
Oh, what, are you mad?
Too bad, dousche bag
News flash, I'm the the new fad
You're that bald spot that never grew back
So get a doo rag
Cause I'm living it up
I just dropped more cash than you get in a month
Up in the Gentlemens Club
Where all the women are drunk
And two bitches always gettin' my adrenalin pumped
Now my click is deeper than your chicks urethra
And we hit the hooka  with a twist of sheesha
Then I mix in reefer, order sixty pizzas
And I get to chiefin' like I'm Wiz Khalifa, bitch!

[Hook]

Fuck you, pay me x4
