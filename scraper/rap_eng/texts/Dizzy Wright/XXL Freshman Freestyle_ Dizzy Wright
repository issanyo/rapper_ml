Yo
Coming from the west put the V in front of the L
I couldn't tell that they wanted to see me fail
Went from XXLs to being on XXL
So when they try to clown, they making fun of themselves
This is pro-gression, work ethic, with a cold message
Dedication, annihilating your whole section
Dizzy Wright, I'm Heaven-sent with the Old Testament
Mixing my music with my spiritual connection
Damn, how he do it? 22 when he moving
I heard it was my moment, I'm just here to fucking prove it
I'm about to lose it, had to 1992 it
Flat top with a passion for lyrics over producing
Obligated, and can you believe he out of Vegas?
And he fly, probably change the appearance of the population
Yeah, this my Inauguration, yeah, I got 'em all debating
I ain't tripping, I'mma just go harder for my daughter
Bottom line is niggas like me is hard to find
Top 10 freshmen, I better be in the starting 5
Like for the weed for me, I sparking mine
Cause we done did the shit
And now all my fans get to witness it
Get money and we flipping it
You ain't a nigga with an attitude
Nigga you just ignorant
Hang yourself if you ain't feeling this
Cause we dreamed it and believed it
Now I'm positive thinking
Dizzy Wright
