[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Uh, look, I appreciate the love without the envy
Heard 'em talking down, but we drowned it out into Henny
Traveling to yo city just to show 'em that we running thangs
Drinking still my fucking stomach pains make me wanna change
When the summer came, I ain't even hesitate
I told Dame, put me on the road so I could elevate
I ain't finna wait, I'm straight with nothing to lose
So if I ain't putting in work, its really nothing to do
So I laugh at 'em, turn my back and they ain't smilin'
Bad habits come from old niggas that act childish
Wildin'? Bitch I am beyond that
My bomb sack is bomb based, so fall back, I'm all that
Rebels on my ball cap, man I ain't a fan of shit
Pull up to mess and we gon' do you like Dizaster did Canibus
Have your man's looking sad in the back
The truth hurts when it's all in the facts, Dizzy Wright nigga

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Tell Lucifer kick his feet up
I'm 'bout to murder niggas, as soon as the smoke is reâ€™d-up
High School bully, I'm fiending to beat this beat up
And if this bitch is pregnant, I'm probably gon' beat the fetus
Bitch I'm pro-choice it's cheaper than an abortion, I'm crazy!
I'm just joking bitch, come on let's have this baby
Fuck a nightmare, I'll tie a white guy to a white chair
Drop him in the hood, yell "NIGGER!"
Leave him right there, I walk around with hacksaws
And 2 by 4's, cause I don't fight fair
I'm ill enough to gun butt you with the rocket launcher
Mr. Benton, say hello to the Lochness Monster
In a black suburban tea-baggin' a fat virgin
Hold still bitch, or else this gas squirtin'
I'm fighting these voices inside my head
It ain't considered rape cause the bitch was already dead
Benton

[Verse 3: Jedi]
The cops pulled me over said the car they must check
I knew what was up, I'm the usual suspect
So he comes to the car, and he does hella shit
Got the look on his face like he's white and he's rich but
I don't give a shit, cause you know I had L
Sure as registration I could not go to jail
Next thing you know he's like, "What is that smell?"
Then I flashed the club card, he was mad as hell
I just had to share that story on a clean-ass beat
Swear you ain't got soap that's as clean as me
Yeah this game I be usin' abusin' these niggas losin'
What I do I do it on Q, shout out Susan
You can catch me in San Francisco cruisin'
Every time I pop up, the bad hoes choosin'
And look, I ain't tryna be lyrical
But I'm just sayin' I ain't never seen a miracle
Life's cold I got soul as far as spirit go
And look I'm gettin' down but I ain't puttin' up with this livin' though

[Verse 4: Irv da Phenom]
I'm under pressure, but never will I let 'em see me sweat
And though I'm only twenty-three I handle business like a vet'ran
I get up in the booth and get to bussin' like a weapon
I ain't left the last three days, rockin' the same clothes that I slept in
And when I finally do sleep it's only a couple hours
Filled with dreams of bustin' rhymes and me findin' beats to devour
Nowadays we all rappers and everybody's a star
But nobody's takin' time on they rhyme or focused on bars
While these niggas bein' trendy and tryna get on the blogs
I was whippin' slangin' my new shit out the trunk of my car
Wouldn't let myself go home 'til I finished flippin' them all
I'm out of town on my dolo I know there's no driftin' off
I gotta stay awake, make it to the next state
Keep on watchin' for them coppers cause they tryna run my place
If they try to pull me over this might turn into a chase
Cause I'm survivin' on my last, I ain't got no extra cash
To be handin' Uncle Sam while I'm tryin' to fight a case
This is bananas I'm 'bout to go ape -- shit
No love for suckas that's hatin' all on that fake -- shit
Cause there's a mil' out there like uncooked food
In the kitchen, and I just gotta make -- it, Phenom!
