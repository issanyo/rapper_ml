I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
I need to know what you want
I need to know what you want
I need to know what you want
So I can move on
My heart can move on

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Now I'm not talking money when I say you using me
But I'm sick and tired of trying fight for how it used to be
Used to be beautifully, but now we gone our seperate ways
But we still together so we argue almost everyday
How can we make it work if you don't wanna make it right?
And why be together if you don't want to make it life?
Was it lies or was it just because we grown apart?
You had my heart but relationships are known to fall
I'm trying to be your all. be you friend, be yo man
Deal with all yo drama, at the same time be a man
I understand what it takes for a relationship
That's why I'm worried that you can't handle the basic shit
Damn, I hope this wasn't all on purpose
I feel I do the right shit for the wrong person
So keep it real and let me know what's going on
Or let me go, or let me know, you want to keep this going on

[Hook]
I need to know what you want
I need to know what you want
I need to know what you want
So I can move on
My heart can move
My heart can move
My heart can move
My heart can move

[Verse 2]
See at first we both had trust issues
But dammit it's been months, I put my trust in you
I can't put it no other way, I fuck with you
But now-a-days, I don't really see much in you
Cause it's more then being beautiful and texting
I need communication, I need affection, sextin', direction
Advise when I be stressin', a blessin', answer to my questions
I miss the old love, the old way, the old you
Because this new attitude, is old news
I know yo old dude, couldn't manage, but dammit
I can't understand if your okay with being damaged
I really wanna make this work, but I don't know how
Cause instead of being grown, we let our anger show out
Let's take control now, put of sight, out of mind, out of line
Speak now because we don't got a lot of time

[Hook]
I need to know what you want
I need to know what you want
I need to know what you want
So I can move on
My heart can move
My heart can move
My heart can move
My heart can move

[Verse 3]
See, you say you love me, but I do not believe you
If I wanted to be alone, then I would be single
So be wrong, or be gone, cause this shit that we on
Got us going back and forward like ping pong
And I'm not feeling it, can't you see that were crashing?
We're missing emotion, we're missing passion
We got that high school love, this shit is average
And baby girl I'm not about to have it
I'm tired of trying, to make it work, when it ain't working
I don't want that common love, that's only good in person
Can't you see I'm hurting from the person that you made Diz
How can we fix it if we argue about the same shit
Appreciate the love that we both came with, but how far are we willing to let this pain get?
Shit, I ain't trying to say that you wrong, but if you don't want this, let me move on
Real shit

I need to know what you want

My heart can move
My heart can move
