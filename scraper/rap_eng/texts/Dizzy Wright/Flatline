[Verse 1]
We embarking on a dangerous experiment
Feeling unbalanced, something done happening
After death is a mystery and I'm curious
Up for the challenge, wanted to know what happens
Psychologically active (right)
I got too many questions
Don't let me die and if there is a hell or heaven
I just want to know how in the hell we all get so connected (how so?)
All I need is five minutes, maybe seven, just to flatline
I'll be back before you even know it (before you know it)
I know where I'm at, but don't know where I'm going
I just need a moment
I just need you to believe in me (believe in me)
Some lines shouldn't be crossed, but I guess we'll see (uh huh)
Came back to life, but my sins came with me
Lost my mind and my soul, I never felt this empty
Saw the other side, now the universe working against me
Soon as my heart stopped, my demons came up to get me
At first, I was just enjoying the gifts (the gifts)
The longer we go, the more we at risk (risk)
Now, I'm seeing things that don't exist (don't exist)
Seeking answers done got me in some shhhhh
(Hey you heard that, you heard that?)
Yeah I heard it too
Or maybe I'm just hearing things
Why do I feel insane?
Why do I feel like I done triggered something in my brain?
(Why do I feel like I done triggered something in my brain?)

[Hook]
Maybe we took it too far (took it too far)
Y'all would not believe what we saw (we saw)
Maybe we done opened up the wrong doors
Maybe this is my fault (my fault)
Maybe we could get a fresh start (fresh start)
I would like you to stop my heart (my heart)
Maybe we could open up the right doors (right doors)
Maybe that's going too far

[Post-Hook]
But I just wanna flatline
I just wanna flatline
(I feel like) maybe this is all my fault
But I just wanna flatline
I just wanna flatline
(I feel like) maybe we going too far

[Verse 2]
Too long (too long), flatline (flatline)
Pure energy, what if I die tomorrow? (what if I die tomorrow?)
My shoes on (shoes on)
I thought about that last time
Now, I'm feeling like I'm followed
I don't do excuses (not at all)
Experimenting with these medical students
I know it sound crazy and you never would do it
You want to learn about it? Man, I hope you don't be foolish
Might just hit me with the electric shock
Extra high, is this life after death or not? (I need to know)
I really thought that this would put me in a better spot (I did)
I'm hearing voices that'll never stop (let me live)
Maybe we done opened up the wrong doors
Trying to open up the right ones, I just might run
I can't handle all of this, what am I on? (what am I on?)
Let bygones be bygones
This what I spend my time on, but

[Hook]
Maybe we took it too far (took it too far)
Y'all would not believe what we saw (we saw)
Maybe we done opened up the wrong doors
Maybe this is my fault (my fault)
Maybe we could get a fresh start (fresh start)
I would like you to stop my heart (my heart)
Maybe we could open up the right doors (right doors)
Maybe that's going too far

[Post-Hook]
But I just wanna flatline
I just wanna flatline
(I feel like) maybe this is all my fault
But I just wanna flatline
I just wanna flatline
(I feel like) maybe we going too...
