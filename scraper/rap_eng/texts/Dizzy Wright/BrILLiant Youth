[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Tell em the youth need it
Oh they want the truth
I’m here for two reasons
What’s that?
Money and respect
What’s that, what’s that?
Money and respect

[Verse 1: Big Remo]
If you back to chargin’ niggas a leg and an arm
Motherfuckers got the right to bear arms
And, so I cherish it, rightfully ain’t soft
When it comes to a nigga, I’m lyrically O-Dog
Doughboy, there’s too many Ricky’s
In this little city, so I’m just out to get it
And any years I feel intimidation this situation gets shaky
It’s too many sketchy, any affiliated out to get me bitches
When I don’t answer texts, they swear I’m sleepin with the next
My father told me play chess piece or they let me breathe
Better swear they evils and Caesar's, they should let me be
But they heathens, they ain’t eaten
I dine with royalty, they see it
Scopin my baked ziti
You openly have a nerve, to joke like I ain’t peep it
But that’s a life of American [?]
Met a stranger, and he said keep preachin’ cause the youth need it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
They need a love, indeed believe it will come
Slam my fingers, stomp my feet, to the beat of this drum
Been stressin’ all weak, dropped the ball, but it’s all G
Play the bass, let’s create, this the sound of my heart beat
Uh, 23, and I’m rockin’ this box cutter
My girlfriend is knocked up
But this a blessin’ that we should keep
With no doubts, this funky shit finna sprout
I’m bout to regulate the game, I got a vouch from Warren G
(West Side)
Las Vegas ain’t never seen another me
It’s only me remaining humble, but the outcome is never cheap
Top of the charts, and I’m trying to last for some weeks
She grabbed my hand, and I put it on the back of her cheeks
I go along, squeeze it, look at me holding on
Stare me down, I almost drowned
I should’ve had my floaties on
Shoulda gave me a warning
New girl, you know you wrong
Obviously, you bringing that shit out of me
Player shit, investigate before you try to board this player ship
Cause you might be taking a later trip
Cause we don’t fuck around with the fuck arounds
24/7 hustlers is niggas that I hung around
