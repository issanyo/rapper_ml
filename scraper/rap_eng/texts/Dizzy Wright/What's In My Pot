[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
I do my best I do not rest a lot
I gotta give it everything I got

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Always coming first, I don't like second place
Gave her this good dick and then shit escalated
She been wilding since her parents separated
Cleaning up my house and buying decorations
Trapping making money what she love to do
Lil babe had potential back in public school
I've been on her head and on her noggin
Cause she'd rather hit the strip than go to college
The money is good, the money is never a problem
Do you want to be a queen or be an item
You can shake that ass but you can't pass your finals
I'ma pass this weed then pass out to the vinyl
Richie, Richie, Richie, Richie bitch im Lionel
You don't got no future but you sure got one behind you
I can tell these vegas streets gon turn you out
And if you ain't not on game then we gon run you out

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I do my best I do not rest a lot
I gotta give it everything I got
I stay ready you can put me on the spot
I'm cooking come and see what's in my pot
I'm cooking (x6)
Come and see what's in my pot
I'm cooking (x6)
Come and see what's in my pot

[Verse 2: Reezy]
You can take a look inside
Cook cook wrist work
Look at how I scrape the side
I ain't ever told a lie
I had white girl in the ride
Got them bitches lapping up
I got white girls in the ride
Dizzy OG thats that fire
Please roll another wood
Big bar like I'm Suge
Lets just get that understood
I just hit another jugg
I just ran another play
In the kitchen cooking up
Bitch I think I'm Bobby Flay

[Verse 3: Easy Redd]
I give it everything I got I do not rest a lot
High as fuck on moon rocks I'm an astronaut
Hit the kitchen whip the pot like I'm Emeril
Just cooked the 745 got a [?]
In traffic, lane swerving
Big game, James Worthy
Liu Kang, kick her out
Hit the bitch, ain't worthy
My life, my rules
I do what I choose
Foreign whip I like my new
Top gone that my new

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
