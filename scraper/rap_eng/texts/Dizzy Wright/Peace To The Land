Kato on the track b-

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the, peace to the land

[Verse 1: Price]
Uh, Price goin' wild, warrents gettin' filed, homies on trial
They say we ain't bringing peace to the land
But the cops set you up
The thots set you up
Labels set you up
Nah, they ain't bringing peace to the land

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Police was created to catch us
Supposed to protect us
But they don't want peace to the land
Speak to the man
Vote him out, get Donald Trump out the office
He don't really want peace to the land

[Verse 3: Demrick]
Bad peace with a plan
Treat this like a beast on a leash
Catch us in the streets and they blam
See how they got us all asleep on the xans
They ain't bringing peace to the land

[Verse 4: Reezy]
They elite with the plan
Drop the heat off in the hood
Only time to bring peace to the land
Can I eat with the fam?
I don't wanna beef with the fam
I'm just tryna bring peace to the land

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Peace to the land
Peace to the land

[Verse 5: Oktane]
Yeah they elected me
To say my piece for peace
So what, I'ma preach to the land
Simple, 2 fingers, peace to the land

[Interlude]
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the land

[Verse 6: Emilio Rojas]
Peace to the land
I run a piece of the land
Wanna own, fuck leasin' the land
Cash got the mark of the beast on they hand
Fuck around and give a small pocket sheet to the clan
Told white lies like Jesus ain't black
Redneck can't say believe in that
Scared of a northern Korean attack
'Cause of fuckboi Trump gave em reason for that
Peace to the land

[Verse 7: Price]
Young Christ, black man speak with a plan
They don't wanna work, they'd rather reach for a hand
On tour a nigga had to sleep in a van
She know I'm spraying vibes, bringin' peace to the land

[Verse 8: Oktane]
Yeah, we just figured out the way to get it
Now to get what we need for the fam
Better use the machine before it jams
I just hope it bring peace to the land

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Peace to the land
Peace to the land

[Verse 9: Dizzy Wright]
Black mom and a white mom
Both raised rap gods so they both brought peace to the land

[Verse 10: Demrick]
We all from the same place, fuck a slave trade
We don't play we just tryin' to bring peace to the land

[Bridge]
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
Peace to the land

[Verse 11: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, peace to the land
Let me preach to em fam
Black man down and they reach for the cam
Got a war full of wolves wanna feast on a lamb
Nigga fighting for his life, guess peace in the plan
Can't leave the crib without the piece in my hand
Pigs wanna put a nigga six feet in the land
A modern day slave locked deep in a can
I'm a god, I'ma manifest dreams in the land
Peace to the land

[Chorus: Dizzy Wright]
Peace to the land
Peace to the land
