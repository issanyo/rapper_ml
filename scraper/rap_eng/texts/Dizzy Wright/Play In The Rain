We used to play out in the rain...

[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Yo, I remember them crazy days, in eight grade
I would kiss your face in the rain
And watch your makeup fade away
You was pure, I promised you I would stay and wait
Left for the weekend, came back and heard you gave it away
Couldn't believe it, plus my family breaking into pieces
My pops cheated, now my mama been searching for Jesus
My sister in Atlanta, my other one's just a fetus
In a woman that I can't stand and don't want my dad to be with
Not defeated, just a teen raising my brother
Saving a lil money to help my mom through the struggle
Saw my brothers every now and then, but now I'm like, fuck them
I tried to let them in on the biz, but I can't trust them
It's disgusting how these niggas act
Yeah, my childhood wasn't perfect
But I would do anything just to get it back
Without my grandmama around it ain't the same
I wanna go back to the days we used to play out in the rain

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, without a question, I'm second guessing some things
Y'all better feed off me, you standing next to a king
Confessing my flaws, but yet I'm still the best in the ring
Finna put my paws on the jaws of the other teams
Mister angry man, heard he got a swing like Mike Tyson
Heard he like fighting, we should convert that into boxing
Nigga switched my motives and slowly I got it popping
Then my nigga got popped, pop, then I stopped it
Fuck life, fuck life, fuck a sin, fuck starting a trend
My brother in the pen and I'm still looking for revenge
Walking down my hood, reminiscing 'bout my kin
Now I'm sitting in this den, sentimental with this pen
Then again, we was young men with no guidance
Tryna avoid trouble, smoking weed, no violence
We ain't hiding, finna live life and get paid
We was never afraid, them was the days, yeah, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Futuristic]
Yeah, yo, I'd ride my bike to the neighborhood that you lived in
Your mama was asleep, cracked the window, then let me slip in
Lost track of time, conversation until the sun came up
You fell asleep on my chest, then I looked at women different
Intentions to be everything that you ever envisioned
Saw you kissing another nigga, hit him and got suspended
Guess my lesson learned
Get it off my chest, when I express with words
It's all a lie if they tell you it's better left unheard
It just occured to me, I'm dwelling on the negative
I struggle then I hustle, yeah, but that's getting repetitive
Let's not forget them crazy summers that we always had
Nintendo sixty four, bumping Michael Jackson bad
Hit the pad, playing tag with my friends in the cul-de-sac
Cooper pretending I'm Shawn Kim, raw shit
We grew up and things changed
I wanna go back to the days we used to play out in the rain
