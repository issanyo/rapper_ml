[Hook]
I wake up, wake and bake, and play my role
Making all this money won't save my soul
Shout out to Joey and Kirk and all my Pros
I got that pack from Freiza then I froze
I'm up and at 'em
Got to go get it
I'm up and at 'em
Got to go get it
I'm up and at 'em
Got to go get it
I'm up and at 'em
And now it's lit

[Verse 1]
I wake up, wake and bake, and then I hit the field
I'm tryna bank that 20K off William Hill
Casino shit, casino shit, casino shit
I got a room so I can smash my Reno bitch
I like to call this one my ghetto princess
She don't ever ever pull up where I live at
She too low key, she just like me cause I'm smokey
That ass is fake but she show real emotions
She only come for a couple days when I need her to
She young and wild and drinking, that's what legal do
She told me she won't slow down for nobody
She gon' stay on Instagram and show the body
For likes and a repost I guarantee she be the freak
I'm up and at 'em, at 'em so she see the tweet
I leave this week, she love me G, she full up on me
I play my role, we sparking up when you pull up on me

I'm up and at 'em
Got to go get it
I'm up and at 'em
Got to go get it
I'm up and at 'em
And now it's lit

[Verse 2]
Up and at 'em, words of life
Wake and bake but for the early flight
Hopping on tour for like 30 nights
Go to sleep, wake up, then get it right
Getting Dizzy, Dizzy, Dizzy Wright
Watch me change it up a couple times
Had to do it for the summertime
Basic all the way to desert pines
Yeah we grew up where the devil play
702, we here every day
You did it? I did it the better way
Klay with the fade away
Watching me splash
Scoring them points fast
Dizzy OG get passed
I'm on your ass
If you try to hold the blunt don't hit me with the "oh my bad"
Niggas out here know I love my plants, I've seen like 3 evolve
I keep my weed involved
Like Birdman I'm talking to all tree of y'all
CEO, put some respek on my name, put some respek on my name
Got my medical card, rolling up loud cause I heard that it help with the pain
Yeah
I'm learning my lesson but I don't really feel the pressure
Smoking like a mad man, I feel like Redman and Method Man put together
Ain't no reason I can't live forever
Coming with the slappers dog
Working everyday to the after dark
Check out the catalog
