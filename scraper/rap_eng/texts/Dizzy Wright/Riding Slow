[Hook: Mark Battles]
I'm riding slow, I'm drifting on the road
Never been this way before
That's just how the story goes
I'm riding slow, I'm drifting on the road
Never been this way before
That's just how the story goes
I'm riding slow, what what
I'm riding slow, what what
I'm riding slow, I'm drifting on the road
Never been this way before
Never been this way before
I'm riding slow

[Verse 1: Los]
Nah, fuck it I'm ridin' slow
But so driven I'm drivin' my chauffeur
This shit that I got on my sofa
Bitches rub it and say "Oh what's this?"
Lookin' at pictures like "Who is this?"
I'm shakin' my head like "Who is this?"
That's me and P. Diddy you stupid bitch
Anyway, I just zone in my Chevy
On the phone in my prezzy
Shine with no stones in my bezzy huh
Peep that, my seat back like a nigga hidin'
Creepin' and you keep peepin' in it like yo bitch inside it
This shit was provided by the Mister Great Battles
And me, myself, Sir sunglasses and safe travels
Nigga life is great, take flight
Or take a picture of a nigga license plate
And break light

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
It's Battles right, flyer than a satellite
Driftin' in the afterlife, whippin' it like Passion Christ
Ain't have ???, so quick to remind me
That's some nonsense, Magic Johnson
I been sick since the 90's, grimy
And I'm only 21, everything you dream about
That's just what we do for fun
You see I'm simply the realest, no fraud in it
Car tinted like an Indian village
And we ridin', Dizzy and Los right beside me
All about the bills til we livin' like the Cosbys
A flower blossomed from the concrete
Use her head to get ahead, I guess she a mind freak

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
I'm Dizzy, hippy, and trippy off of the voodoo
Hang loose in Honolulu I'm smokin' takin' a booboo
They tell me do you before ??? mama knew you
Nigga he was just another rapper on the internet... fuck you bitch
Compatible, casual, but he kind of radical
So a fascinating fatalities in the battle zone
The Vegas Knight I got stripes to be in the bravest
Behavior problems I'm proud I was made a medical patient
I'm a nerd I fell in love with the herb
Always goin' on a rant, conversations with my plants
She says Smokeout Conversations was my jam
Before I knew who I was, it helped me find who I am

[Hook]
I'm riding slow, I'm drifting on the road
Never been this way before
That's just how the story goes
I'm riding slow, I'm drifting on the road
Never been this way before
That's just how the story goes
I'm riding slow, what what
I'm riding slow, what what
I'm riding slow, I'm drifting on the road
Never been this way before
Never been this way before
I'm riding slow
