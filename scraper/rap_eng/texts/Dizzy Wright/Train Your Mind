[Intro]
Yo, it's been 20 years since 1995
It's been 20 years since 1995
Since Pac dropped Me Against The World
It's been 20 years since 1995
E-40 did it In a Major Way, yamp
And Bone dropped E. 1999
It's been 20 years since 1995

[Verse 1]
Yo, I can tell they wasn't gon' be laughing at me later
Now the same niggas is asking me for favors
When i heard this beat I start feeling like Jigga man on "Imaginary Players"
Thinking to myself like, "these new niggas can't rap like this"
Four grams off the scale straight into my maintainer
If you ain't saying shit then fuck them headbangers and I'm screaming it out
Making music for you to lap dance
I wouldn't be surprised if my future killer's a black man
Wake up, walk out, another man chalked out
I feel like everyday i see the world a little different when it start out
CNN showing the wrong niggas going all out
Can't have a black event without black people having a fallout
Shout out to all my leaders that take on risks
Educated brothers against these niggas that make no sense
I see you wanna be uplift, dog, you can bank on this
Here to keep it real, not to play no tricks, ya punk bitch!

[Hook]
So just ride to it, can you vibe to it?
To see the good in everything you gotta train your mind
Don't let this motherfucking world waste your time
Holla at me if you change your mind, I want to world to just
Ride to it, we getting high to it
To see the good in everything, you gotta train your mind
You gotta train your mind, holla at me if you change your mind
I want the world to just...

[Verse 2]
Concentrate, rolling something up with organic vibes
Blending in, walking through these streets like I'm camouflaged
I'm dealing with this third eye shit
I see who they wanna be with three eyes
I got two to look and one to see
Better watch out boy
I been had it now I'm right back to it
Got an old soul, with this stoner body attached to it
Happy that I'm alive, wake up with a smile on my face
Getting a back massage, baby already rolled up an eighth
Now I'm in this routine, she know what i like
Cherish the simplest things
But she don't wanna be in another situation-ship
Been so invested in being the best don't know what to make of it
But she see the good in my dreams and why I been chasing them
I had no love for them so why would I wait for them?
I see these kids in Vegas, I'm tryna be great for them
I'm talking the real life academy
No, I'm not here to brag about my salary
I'm here to try shape your mentality

[Hook]
So just ride to it, can you vibe to it?
To see the good in everything you gotta train your mind
Don't let this motherfucking world waste your time
Holla at me if you change your mind, I want to world to just
Ride to it, we getting high to it
To see the good in everything, you gotta train your mind
You gotta train your mind, holla at me if you change your mind
I want the world to just...

[Verse 3]
Focused on variety
I'm not the new 2Pac cause I'm here to do this quietly
But I'm here to shape society
Couldn't even envision what I'm tryna be
I'm next level with it
Thank you Funk Volume for signing me to come get it
Now i'm in it, spreading positivity and empowerment
Doing this way before Kendrick
Was rapping about lacking confidence
Feeling like all this new rap music just ruins it
So I'm here to let go of my outer inner-fluences, I'm cooling it
Giving all you niggas something real to follow
Even though the truth is a hard pill to swallow
It's still the motto
Painting imagery so vivid it could rival Picasso
If you don't fit in today there's still tomorrow
Hoping it benefits us both
With these words tatted on me some gon' feel it and some won't
Nah, it ain't no hard feelings...

[Outro]
20 years since 1995
