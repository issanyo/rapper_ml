[Verse 1]
Yeah, young man, I swear I got a mind of my own
I'm heading to the top and I'm minding my own
Wondering what it would be like to lie in the throne
And yeah you with me, but I still feel I'm riding alone
So I use this music to release anger
It's like I'm explaining myself to a complete stranger
But you listen and I notice
Thank you for being so focused on me when I was at my lowest
Everybody flowing cause they wanna get a bad bitch
But my nine to five is working on this rap shit,
So I get offended when pretending is image,
That the livin' love, man this is some sad shit
I never had shit
So I'm losing my friends chasing these dreams
So me and my fam could have shit,
So I'm on it
Trying to remain the strongest
And still with all these struggles;

[Hook]
Somehow I gotta get up in the morning
Yeah, I gotta get up in the morning
Yeah, I gotta get up in the morning
Yeah,so I can remain the strongest
Yeah, I gotta get up in the morning
Yeah, I gotta get up in the morning
Yeah, I gotta get up in the morning
Yeah, still gotta remain the strongest
Second verse let's do it

[Verse 2]
I wake up early in the morning, I'm zoning
I'm living for the moment
Wondering how my homies turn to opponents
When that money gets to falling in
You get to falling out
As time goes you realize what it was all about
And those rumors get to spreading like diseases
I get that snailface, like do you really believe this?
Y'all need Jesus, I mean everyone
Yeah I said it son, doing what's been never done
And these niggas is starting to act like bitches
And I'm not trying to be wrong
But Y'all don't bleed every month
Look down and realize you got a flat homie
And you ain't hurting me because you turned your back on me
You a phony and I wonder how that makes you feel
And just cause you clap guns nigga that don't make you real
But I knew you for the longest, homie
So when you lay down at night as a fake;

[Modified Hook]
How do you get up in the morning?
Damn, how do you get up in the morning
Damn, how do you get up in the morning
Damn, knowing damn well you a phony, (ha)
How do you get up in the morning?
Nigga, how do you get up in the morning
Yeah, how do you get up in the morning
Damn, knowing damn well you a phony
Third verse let's do it

[Verse 3]
Baby you summertime sexy
So tell me why you do that, you know;
Sell your body just to kick it with these new jacks
Where your film crew at?
Where your model pictures?
Is money really worth your dignity to follow niggas?
It's amazing how these beautiful women can lose control
In a life so cold, where souls turn into hoes
But you better than that
I can see it in your eye vision
These niggas lye with you
Treat you like these side bitches
And you know this but you ignore reality
I bring it to the light and now your ass wants to get mad at me?
But I'm cool with showing you how you fucking up
Get a job and stop selling your body for a couple bucks
Niggas hurt your feelings, now you don't fuck with love
Life's hard, understand that, and suck it up
Get closer to God, and he will keep you the warmest
And I swear you will feel better:

[Modified Hook]
When you wake up in the morning
Yeah, when you wake up in the morning
Yeah, when you wake up in the morning
Yeah, God will keep you the warmest
Yeah, So when you wake up in the morning
Damn, when you wake up in the morning
Yeah, when you wake up in the morning
I promise God will keep you the warmest, Yeah
