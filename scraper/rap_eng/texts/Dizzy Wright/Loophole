[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
So this year I'm coming with all these accurate predictions
Went from rapping with envy to these rapping transitions
I'm bringing these people together I hope y'all don't evacuate the building
Give me a chance to speak my mind yo I got some shit that got some feeling
My flow so spoken wordish
Don't be nervous just accept it
'Cause this gon' be that history that change the future forever
This that evolve wisdom
So every record I got to go get 'em
And for the record I ain't stopping until they down size the prison systems
But this the land of free though
That's what they taught us that's what you and me know
That's some bullshit we come from next generational trauma
I'm talking about these black fathers taking away from they kids mama
Na we ain't tryna go back to them Ronald Reagan days
They want to charge us for a crime so they can treat us like a slave
But I ain't making this up look what the loop hole says
So look shout out to Obama you did the best no debating
I think it's amazing for you and your family after legal segreagation
One love

[Hook: Nowdaze]
I can't keep living life this way
Always watching out for the loop hole yeah yeah
Land of the free but we all got a price to pay
Got to watch out for the loop hole yeah yeah
And they hate it when a young man got something to say
I got something to say
But nothings changed
Oh no no nothings changed
One love

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Aye yo I actually think it's crazy to see my people like this
'Cause this what happen when you go and  kill a generation of leaders
They criminalize our black movements until they didn't exist
If this is making you uncomfortable yo I wouldn't fuck with me either
So yo check it
I get it you want to be savage when shit is reckless
'Cause even I respond different when my emotions is infested
Brodie by all means I hear you and I fuck with it
But if you respond with anger with out a goal then they gon' pop it from the punishment
Look I don't know it all I just do my research on the government
I'm 26 a young parent with 2 kids that God trust me with
I can't fail ain't no way Moski got a daughter now
I know you a man brodie but I got your back when you falling down
I see the difficulties that life throwing at niggas like us
They finding ways to discredit us so I can't get us up
I got to spread the message fast
Quarterback and set the pass
'Cause I know the truth about them tryna put us in a permanent second class

[Hook: Nowdaze]
I can't keep living life this way
Always watching out for the loop hole yeah yeah
Land of the free but we all got a price to pay
Got to watch out for the loop hole yeah yeah
And they hate it when a young man got something to say
I got something to say
But nothings changed
Oh no no nothings changed

[Bridge: Nowdaze]

And brother even though the news won't show it I know your a king
Sister they don't want for you to know that you been a queen

[Hook: Nowdaze]
