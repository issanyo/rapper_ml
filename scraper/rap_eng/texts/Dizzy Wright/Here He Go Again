[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
The time's now, everybody's watching already
I'm probably high but I've been up that's why my eyes are heavy
If you met me I swear you'd probably never forget me
I'm visualizing eternal in heaven drivin' a Chevy, bout' to
Pick up God and do a little ventin', even though I knows he know I just want to see if he'll listen
I need a little attention that I can't get up out these hoes, I'm looking at my main I'm feelin' bad but she don't know
Hold up, did I admit my faults? Or did I tell you in a nutshell you ain't did your part?
I learned that life come with women who make decisions hard
I probably get in them drawers but I won't get involved
See I'm cool with being the bad guy
Life's short I never ask why you focus on that negative shit I let it pass by
Why? Cause I'm accomplishing what I'm aimin' for a lots happened but we got a lot to be thankful for

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
So even with whatever's goin' on keep your mind set strong and focus on all your positives
Fuck anybody trying bring you down cause the times now you got dreams nigga go follow them
Here he go again (spittin' that real shit)
Here he go again
Oh here he again
Here he go again

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Oh shit, here I go again preachin' that self love until I see it soakin' in
I want to see you smilin' before you even notice him
Reminiscing on happiness you found in your older sin
I'm still talking about the same shit
Reality, different nationality pain shit
I'm trying to help you understand what you can't get
Like there is some good men even though we ain't shit
But you will probably never get it
Until your mind matures to someone with better intentions
Better listen if you wanna be in better positions
I smoke weed and read the Bible you never will get it
Motherfucker don't judge me, or focus on the negative shit that you see
Instead of focusing on what I read
You looking at the bad and I'm searching for G-O-D
I'm in the process of a change if you don't like it you can leave, motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
I got the kind of love that never dies
Always keep it real and never lie
Supply to all your buyers but be safe and use your mind
Avoid don't exploit it's no reason to waste your time
Hold up, hold up
I got the kind of love that never dies
Always keep it real and never lie
Supply to all your buyers but be safe and use your mind
Avoid don't exploit it's no reason to waste your time
We got money to get, we got places to go
If you know you headed down what're you taking me for?
You let Satan know I'm a christian
And I wouldn't take a field trip to visit him
Cause he ain't about to fuck with my spirit
Hold up I got something to say
But got nothing to lose, I am my own king even if I am nothing to you
You do your dirt but you swear you in love with your boo
But on the down low she know that's why she fucking me too
Nigga what's up?
You can't handle the real? You thought you was gonna be the only one playing the field?
Nigga please she gotta be pleased too, there's millions and millions of niggas do you really think she need you?
Nah

[Hook]
