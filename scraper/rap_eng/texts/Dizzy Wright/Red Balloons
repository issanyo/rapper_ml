[Intro: ]
And we still praying you get through this
Dear Lord, please help this family through this
Yes we praying you get through this

[Hook: ]
Red balloons for a child that we lost today
Red balloons for a child that we lost today
As a parent I pray I pray I pray
As a father I pray I pray I pray I
Red balloons for a child that we lost today
Red balloons for a child that we lost today
No way no way no way
I can feel that change on the way

And we are..

[Verse 1: ]
I'm holding my daughter and writing this verse
To guide and protect you that always come first
But someone losing a kid and showing me how short life really is
Spread the love, don't try to make things worse
My broken heart goes out to those out
That lost one too soon, are you lost and confused?
It's not the time to be questioning God
Don't blame yourself you did a hell of a job (impeccable)
Just know he's the one that you can run to
When a parent's worse nightmare come true
But I heard it's hard to sleep at night
So I pray for comfort and rest for the people that still depressed
Look, never take your life for granted
You don't know what trials and tribulations you might be handed
It's unpredictable and never understanding
And it's foul, no family should have to bury a child
So it's..

[Hook: ]

[Bridge: ]
And we are, praying you get through this
We are praying you get through this
We praying you get through this
Lord knows you gon' get through this
Please help this family through this
Please help his family through this
Please help our families through this
Please help his family through this
(Yo, Rest in paradise
To all the lil' youngsters out there
Love and strength to all the families out there
Damn right
For a child that we lost today)

[Verse 2: ]
That we lost today
Lord knows it ain't right
She can't touch his skin, can't look him in his eyes
I pray for peace, I pray for shrimp
No child should be killed
So when I see somebody down I know exactly how they feel
I've been through hell and back
But I'm kneeling down and I'm hoping you hear me now
Bring them babies back in Nigeria (bring them babies back in Nigeria)
And I don't sing, lord knows I don't sing
I just want you to feel my passion
It don't matter how all this happened
We just want you to take some action
So it's..

[Hook: ]

[Bridge: ]
And we are, praying you get through this
We are praying you get through this
We praying you get through this
Lord knows you gon' get through this
Dear Lord, please help this family through this
Please help his family through this
Dear Lord, please help our families through this
Please help our families through this
