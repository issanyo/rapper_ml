(Intro/hook)
I think you can do much better than me
After all the lies i made you believe
Then guilt kicks in and i start to see
The edge of the bed where your nightgown used to be
I told myself i won't miss you, but i remember
What it feels like beside you(come on come on come on)
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And i think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

(Verse 1 : Dizzy Wright)

Love stories, we seem to all read it
Or believe in, something only a few achieve then
Its a lot of cheatin, so why be open for?
If the roller coaster that im ridin is emotional
Its like im 'pose to go, cause im not innocent
And if i hate cheaters, tell me why im on some pimpin shit
Im just a hypocrite, cause i lie to these women
And start trippin when my girlfriend gets suspicious
I wanna be a better man but i am not able
And you should not have to put up with why im not faithful
And as the day go, im feelin more grimy
Cause when i fell in love you were standin right behind me
So i never fell something that ive never been through
So if you fall in love please know what youre falling into

(hook)
I told myself i won't miss you, but i remember
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And i think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

(Verse 2 : Dizzy Wright)

Im just not ready  to be beside you
I love you so much but you shouldn't be lied to
And dont cry boo, this is like a love letter
Turned into a rap telling you that you deserve better
I know it seems childish, and i know it seems wrong
And i know the saying you never know what you got until its gone
Singin the same song, im on your level now
Very mature but im just not ready to settle down
With a frown i dont want you to catch a love bug
By another man, thats not selfish thats what love does
Im not a hater but i love her man
And livin in this motherland i couldn't see her with another man
I would die slow, seems like my mind froze
Hope im dreamin without my eyes closed
So

(Hook)
I told myself i won't miss you, but i remember
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And i think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
