[Intro]
They say, they say, they say, they say what they want
They say, they say, they say, they say what they want

[Hook]
They say I won't make it but I will, oh but I will
I'm keeping it moving and yes I'm rollin' on 'em, rollin' on 'em
Well I'm balling if you wanna build, come on let's build
I'm keeping it moving trying to own the moment, own the moment
They say I won't make it from Flint to Vegas dog
They say I won't make it, I guarantee you dog
They say I won't make it from Flint to Vegas dog
They say I won't make it from Flint to Vegas

[Verse 1]
Yo, momma told me to pack them bags because we leaving
I got ambition and I do not deserve this treatment
It's kinda crazy I was younger serving the operation
Didn't miss a conversation
I remember the age when I began noticing what they were saying
Picking up on everything
When you realize life ain't glitter and gold it's a scary thing
I wonder how my life would've been if we had settled down
I wonder if my pops was around would he have held it down
I think about my past but I don't like to reflect too much
That's why I get my cash and I don't like to flex too much
I keep it cool cause I done seen too many niggas lose it all
I seen 'em fall, I learned early, I learned early dog
And I never thought that the streets would work against me
Struggling at home had me leaving feeling empty
[?] behind the boulevard mall
Put it on pause and getting applause because

[Hook]
They say I won't make it but I will, oh but I will
I'm keeping it moving and yes I'm rollin' on 'em, rollin' on 'em
Well I'm balling if you wanna build, come on let's build
I'm keeping it moving trying to own the moment, own the moment
They say I won't make it from Flint to Vegas dog
They say I won't make it, I guarantee you dog
They say I won't make it from Flint to Vegas dog
They say I won't make it from Flint to Vegas

[Verse 2]
Living off of them food stamps and coupons
In a group called the Future, it was me, KG, and [?]
Our parents had a whole lot of faith in us
I was just broke with no clothes like nigga lace me up
I'm with whatever if I could make it and she could take a cut
I'm just trying to get her out of this bubble she in
But when them bills keep coming in and the stress starts to build
Handling 5 kids in unreal, trying to provide all these meals
I couldn't even imagine how she felt half of the time
It's only 24 hours in a day and she worked half of the time
Didn't seem like it was working out half of the time
Until I wrapped my arm around her in karma, we got good karma
No worries, you got a soldier
But now I'm getting older and I'm seeing things different
You did your best, that shelter home could've been the system
I appreciate you putting the mic in my hand
I hope you appreciate what I give 'em cause

[Hook]
They say I won't make it but I will, oh but I will
I'm keeping it moving and yes I'm rollin' on 'em, rollin' on 'em
Well I'm balling if you wanna build, come on let's build
I'm keeping it moving trying to own the moment, own the moment
They say I won't make it from Flint to Vegas dog
They say I won't make it, I guarantee you dog
They say I won't make it from Flint to Vegas dog
They say I won't make it from Flint to Vegas
