[Verse 1]
I'm still searchin' for a deal
Lurkin' for a bill
Still searchin' for my soul
Tryna come across the real
Criticizing survival
Ain't no hope in these streets
Judgemental Christians, how low can you be
Talk about me
Like we don't praise the same guy
Cause you can say what you want
But you ain't God
Talk about how my pants saggin'
But if I wore my pants backwards
It still wouldn't change my connection
Pastor, I ain't giving you no money
Cause you ain't taking my money
To make God come second
So do not pass that basket in my direction
Brainwashing people with that segment
Like they gon' be selected, fuck you
They try to make it seem like the more money you give
The more God will love you
Nigga please
You blinded by the word like we slow about it
So I'm here to let you know about it
Cause

[Hook]
They gon' try to knock me down
Say I ain't shit, tryna make me pissed
Motherfucker, I'mma do whatever it takes
Nigga, I'mma do whatever it takes
I represent the right road with my bro's
Won't sell my soul
For no fuckin' dough
Motherfucka, this is it
I'mma do whatever it takes
Nigga, I'mma do whatever it takes

[Verse 2]
Since I was eight years old
I developed into an artist
A tsunami hit my heart
And that's the reason why I'm heartless
They try to bargain in this office with an offer
But not selling my soul is just making me another target
Is it worth it?
Especially when your mind is over purposed
When your daughter need a daddy and daddy is always workin'
I look in her eyes and I get nervous
Cause the world we live in don't make you a better person
See I'm hurtin' and it's scary as can be
If they kill me I pray to God you bury me a G
While I'm in heaven
Let my music carry on for me
And in my will I'mma thank God for everything you see
This is me trying to better my ways
This is me doing whatever it takes
To try make it out the struggle
I ain't never had nothin'
I think it's my time
I feel I deserve somethin'
And if not, please guide me to the road
So I can stop wasting my time with these flows
I need to know
But I got faith in the craft that I uphold
So I hold it close
Lettin' you know, mothafucka

[Hook]
They gon' try to knock me down
Say I ain't shit, tryna make me pissed
Motherfucker, I'mma do whatever it takes
Nigga, I'mma do whatever it takes
I represent the right road with my bro's
Won't sell my soul
For no fuckin' dough
Motherfucka, this is it
I'mma do whatever it takes
Nigga, I'mma do whatever it takes

[Outro]
I'mma do whatever it takes
Nigga, I'mma do whatever it takes
Anything handed to you ain't worth havin'
Work for everything you want
Soul searchin'
