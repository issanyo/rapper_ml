[Hook: ]
I’m bout to roll my weed, but I’m rolling skimps, hey
I still been on my job tryna, take care of my kid
And I’ve been on my grind, and on my shit
I never thought that I would ever see the world like this but, hey
My nigga life goes on, hey
My nigga life goes on

[Verse 1: ]
I’m sick of my day job
And my dumbass co–workers who always saying something smart with an attitude
You wake up and you be mad at who?
You drag your attitude to work and give it to everyone after you
Bitch we work the same job that you do
Don’t come fuck up my day cause you focused on tryna do you
I’m tired too and I don’t wanna be here either
You need to sit down and take a breather
You ain’t the only one paying bills I learnt that stress is a bitch and guess what
We all got a meet her
Shit gets a little deeper I ain’t coming at you rude
But I came to do my job, you fucking up my mood
And now I wanna leave and that’s money I know I lose
Money I know I need but I don’t need this from you
Uh, so if I spaz
Don’t act like I ain’t warned your little selfish ass
So I'mma relax cause

[Hook x2: ]

Break it down, break it down

[Verse 2: ]
See I wake up to the same shit
Brush my teeth smoke a blunt and give my dame a kiss
Back into the world I go nigga
It’s getting harder yeah I know nigga
You couldn’t stand to take a close picture
I’m at this bus stop, hot as fuck
Giving it my all but it’s not enough
I got all of this shit that’s poppin up
Losing control of my balance, spending more on my habits
Tryna establish my talent, I think I’m ready but
You will never understand me
I wanna chase a dream but shit I got a feed a family
I got a voice nigga!
But it don’t mean shit if you ain’t talking about a hundred hoes up on your dick
So shit!
I’m at the point where I feel that I gotta pick
And at the end of the day I’m picking this
Ain’t that about a bitch
But fuck it I guess that’s how life goes
My life is the Wright Road
But on the low I’m bout to go and let em know

[Hook x2: ]

Break it down, break it down
