[Verse 1: Pink Grenade]
Mm, yeah, oooh
Side project propaganda
City of angels
California

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I keep getting caught in the mix
I wonder I wish
I got fake, but do real love exist
I know my time is coming soon
So I stare at the moon
She say one day your words will uplift
So I feed it to the world
Do you need a plate
If Vegas bring me down, then I need a break
I’m on the freeway to LA (I’m on the freeway to LA)
I’m on the freeway to LA (I’m on the freeway to LA)
Look, running away from you ain’t what I’m trying to do
So I’ll be there before the sun shine on you
And I hope you feel my presence before I get there
Goosebumps when I sit there for these 3 days in LA
Like I love that, anyways
We converse through the verse
What’s worse than an outverse that we don’t really mean
But, what’s a king without a queen
I can feel your blessing now
For my 3 days in LA
Now

[Chorus: Pink Grenade]
Step back and take a minute, won’t ya
Step back and back in California
Side project propaganda
Step back and get marijuana
Get marijuana (marijuana) [x2]
Get marijuana
Side project propaganda

[Verse 2: Jonathan Hay]
My first day entering LA
I took a right on I-10 to Santa Monica freeway
Big city, big lights, big dreams
The city of angels is not what it seems
Hollywood no good when you got no cash
Will someone lend a hand and help this man
I don’t understand what your plan for me
Everybody mad, including family
Losing sanity in Los Angeles
3 days in the city of angels
City of angels
Like those days in LA
Woke up with an ounce
Drugs and drink was the game of the day
I was 15 years old playing my guitar for nickels at the Santa Monica pier
Going wild at the beach bonfire at night
But the sky, so clear

[Chorus:]
Step back and take a minute, won’t ya
Step back and ride to California
Side project propaganda
Step back and get marijuana
Do on my, do on my, do on my command [x4]
Step back and take a minute, won’t ya
Step back and ride to California
Side project propaganda
Step back and get marijuana
Get marijuana (get marijuana)

[Chorus:]
Step back and take a minute, won’t ya
Step back and back in California
Side project propaganda
Step back and get marijuana
Get marijuana

[Jonathan Hay, Sylvia Massy and Mike Smith]
