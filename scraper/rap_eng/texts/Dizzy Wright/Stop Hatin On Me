[Verse 1]
I feel I'm the shit cause everybody talkin
I know I'm the shit cause everybody watchin uh!
I'm tryna make it to the top, but the top seems far when everybody is stallin
Yeah, young man tryna stand out, and I'm tryna be the best. hands down
I rep the vegs so I'm more than just a man now
I'm makin dough and now everybody got there hand out
Damn, ya'll niggas trippin, niggas see the money comin in and wanna kick it
And when I say I'm busy, all of you dick heads, start sayin that I'm startin to get a big head
But I'm out in the streets chasin the big bread, I ain't gotta start I'm cool with bein the sixth man
I got problem tryna mix it in with the dreams, get money then mix it in with the team
So what's all the hate for nigga just stop it, when it's time to hate em I'm always the topic
But I realize niggas want attention and it's hard to ignore some one that's so poppin

[Hook]
Back up I need my space, mother fucker stop being so fake
Nigga please get up out my face and quit with all of that hate
And I say
Hol' up, hol'up stop hatin on me [x3]
I'm just tryna do my thing

[Verse 2]
I'm looking in a mirror and I see faith
You looking in a mirror and u see hate
I'm suprised your ass could even see straight
And I'm a make it the VEG way
Hol'up nigga tryna jock my style
Fuck that nigga I'm a aim for the clouds
Sit on that bitch and then aim for your mouth
As I'm pissing and I'm dissing yelling nigga what now?
Laughing, enjoying the fact, you niggas hating on me
I'm never coming down, so why you waiting on me
God's Child so you know that nigga Satan on me
So shout out to all the people that's praying for me
Yeah, it's kinda hard in the game
When you coming out and going hard in the pain
Niggas on your ass trynna hock for the same
But they talk and they hate to obtain. man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See don't hate if you don't know
Your just mad cause the people seem to want more
But you should respect the fact it ain't a dumb flow
And if you don't like it well your ass can hit the front door!
Yeah, cause I would never put the mic down
A nigga tryna move into a nice house
Beating up these tracks nigga I'm aight now
I might smell but who cares when the lights down
Geez, let a nigga, breath!
My little nigga breese tell me that these niggas is weak
As the weeks go by, a nigga move closer
The closer I get shit, I loose closure
Mm but I don't ever really trip
Alcoholic mind set, but I don't ever really sip
But all of these hits that attract all the clips
Make it easy to live like I'm the shit
YEAH!

[Hook]
