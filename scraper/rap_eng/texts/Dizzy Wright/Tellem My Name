[Intro]
Yeah, mic check, one two, one two
Now what's my motherfucking name?

[Hook] [4x]
D-I-Z-Z-Y, Wright, D-I-Z-Z-Y, that's right

[Verse 1]
Yo, guess who's in your Dre Beats
Walking down these Veg streets
Mister D-I double Z-Y
If you motherfuckers hate me
Can't relate to nothing that I be saying
There's a chance you shouldn't be alive
I'm moving, I don't need a whip
Rapping on my Four Agreements shit
Giving knowledge, you could keep the tip
He treat change like it's loose change
It hit the ground, he leave it there
Cause he don't wanna look lame, what a shame
I don't ego trip, I keep it a hundred
Niggas rather be hooked on phonics than graduate
That shit aggravate, nigga, give your mama a happy day
Don't throw your life away to sit at home and masturbate
The truth speaker, cooler than your new sneakers
The real thinker, but my crew deeper
I got these visionary plans
Thorough nigga, solid like a military man
And I'm feeling like the man, what's my name?

[Hook] [4x]

[Verse 2]
Uh, if i ain't the hottest in the game
Then who's life I gotta take? (take)
He trapped in a phone booth, with a rifle to his face
I'm sick of the lies so I write down a license plate
Pull up to the crib with a CD, just to break it in his face
What you mean I ain't taking over
I seen the war sometimes decline, but shit we made it over
This new history
Give what they give to me
Independent is the new industry
You better get with it nigga
Now I got this shit that ain't replacing
Platinum kush got a nigga look half asian, call these the chinky eyes
Tatted artist are them, so mothefuckin gravity fly
Sweetiepie you can get this dick if you just need a guide
Deceiving has a reason amount
Every season giving you strength for you to believe in yourself
Wealth a common topic you can keep to yourself
But they can't I created a lane for a little change
What's my name?

[Hook] [4x]
