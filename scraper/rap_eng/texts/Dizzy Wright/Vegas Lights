[Verse 2: CashflowEllis]

I'm in a backseat getting chauffeured
Presidential rover, hour long back rub
Girl on each shoulder
Bout to roc the nation like them artists to hova
Haters keeping tabs and this what they keeping notes of
Famsquad baby, I'm sure they all know us
Nevermind about them people who thought they did it before us
Gentleman but soldiers // watch how u approach us
I don't wanna get involved wit missing person and they close up

Red bottom pisulas // Lace em when I suit up
With a dime I scooped up, got her legs 2 up
The chauffeur got the window up so he won't see us do stuff
And if u acting shy I tell u peace and chuck the 2 up

Don't think I'm being rude, I'm just vibing with the mood
Belagio penthouse suite around noon
Alexander maqueen stylist can help u groom
But can't not stay for tonight because I be on the move
