[Hook: Sy Ari]
Oh what a difference, yeah, oh what a difference
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, I still made a killing
Oh what a difference, ay, oh what a difference
The cook up is real, why you think I'm in the kitchen?
Oh what a difference, yeah, oh what a difference
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, I still made a killing
Oh what a difference, wooh
You fuckin', I'm fuckin', ho what's the difference?
Oh what a difference

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Look how these fake bitches treat you when you fucked up and live in grandmother's house
Now watch how them same bitches treat you when you gettin' guap and you finally get out
Oh what a difference
What a difference, a difference, when you smell like dead presidents
Shit get bald like Maleficent
Kick the door of your residence
A-Town's what I represent
Mix the Sprite with the medicine
Mama call me a reverend
On the east side like Jeffersons
Tell that bitch get a reference
In her mouth like a peppermint
Stick the clip in, I sniff acrylic
You bitches with it, I lift your spirit
I cut your neck with a pair of scissors
In the Hilton in Paris with Paris Hilton
Ain't no mercy, I bury children
I'm an an-an-an-anomaly
Date with death, I took the bitch to the prom with me
Infrared scope on the star, no astronomy
Cutting off my enemies, tell them niggas call for me
Yeah, bitch it's still FV
Shooting at your motherfucking yacht on a jet ski
Fuck the police, tell the pigs come arrest me
Pull off in a wraith, tell them pussy niggas catch me

[Hook: Sy Ari]
Oh what a difference, yeah, oh what a difference
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, I still made a killing
Oh what a difference, ay, oh what a difference
The cook up is real, why you think I'm in the kitchen?
Oh what a difference, yeah, oh what a difference
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, I still made a killing
Oh what a difference, wooh
You fuckin', I'm fuckin', ho what's the difference?
Oh what a difference

[Verse 2: Grafh]
Oh, all my niggas on it, all they know is action
All my niggas greedy, no one know no satisfaction
No one know what happened, no relaxing
All we know is savage
Loaded rachets, broken bones and fragments
Ho I hope it happened faster than my e-mail
Cause load with no attachment, goin' over rachet
Homegrown reefer, I'm strapped with that chrome, long heater
I'm disrespectful, I'm in your quiet library with my phone on speaker
No respect for the po-po neither
I'ma-I'ma do what y'all would never do
I'ma split your head in two, whippin' residue
Sticking edibles in your kid's vegetables
Skip ahead of you for getting scheduled
I'm getting sicker and sicker, it's terrible, sniffin' this Theraflu
Shit is hysterical, listen to Perry or forget tryna listen to radio
Stick a clip in the stereo
Fixing to bury you so here we go now
Heavy gold crown 'bout the size of the merry-go-round
Never slow down, I let your ho 'round my dick cause it never go down
I leave 'em dead and below ground, boom!

[Hook: Sy Ari]
Oh what a difference, yeah, oh what a difference
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, I still made a killing
Oh what a difference, ay, oh what a difference
The cook up is real, why you think I'm in the kitchen?
Oh what a difference, yeah, oh what a difference
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, I still made a killing
Oh what a difference, wooh
You fuckin', I'm fuckin', ho what's the difference?
Oh what a difference

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
If you ask any of my niggas they'll tell y'all it's 420 every day
If she complain about how much we smokin', shit I just might not let her stay
Don't push me, I escalate
I got two phones like Kevin Gates
I got bitches that handle bitches for me
Easy, I hit them, they text me the letter K
We gon' ride through them heaven gates
Leavin' earth and the devilish
Taking weed and the settlement
Fuck with me, you get handled with
By niggas that handle vases just like Richard Hamilton
Now that's a face mask for your fake ass, better break fast
I'm breaking bad up in the kitchen, tryna make it last
My head is turning, my turning point, I get in the lab
Ho what's the difference? we not vibing, go get in the cab
What's wrong with your hearing? don't get in your feelings
Can't have nobody kill my spirit
I been counting, learning limits
My moments now and I am driven
Time is ticking, no complaining, bitchin', I ain't with it
Players never play the victim
Man we 'bout that getting paid and play the system
Payin' homage, why you playin' with him?

[Hook: Sy Ari]
Oh what a difference, yeah, oh what a difference
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, I still made a killing
Oh what a difference, ay, oh what a difference
The cook up is real, why you think I'm in the kitchen?
Oh what a difference, yeah, oh what a difference
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, I still made a killing
Oh what a difference, wooh
You fuckin', I'm fuckin', ho what's the difference?
Oh what a difference
