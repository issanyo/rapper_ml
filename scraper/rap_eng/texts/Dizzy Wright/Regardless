[Hook: Dizzy Wright x2]
Here we are again, right where we started
We came too far to be taking it personal now that we got it
Nigga regardless, homie regardless
You better hold that shit down
Nigga regardless, homie regardless
You better hold that shit down

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
At this point I don't give a fuck what they say about me
I've been doing my thang, little nigga in the game tryna save somebody
Take care of my kids, don't worry about me, homie I ain't nobody
Yeah we asked what it's like, then we get it and we sipping in the hotel lobby
Going city to city and we getting paid
Going to legalize marijuana for a positive change
Yeah, we been this way for too long, good thing I learned all this at a young age
Now I'm older now, flow sounding a little doper now
Tell my Uncle Lay that I'm outspoken now
They hang up my posters now (fuck playing it safe)
Realize that we all got shit to be thankful for
So we work everyday 'til we can't no more
Blow up and feel famous 'til they [---]
Living the lie young king, you don't ever have to please the world
(hell nah, hell nah, nigga hell nah)
Now numb to the feeling I don't need referrals
Or your kind accommodations, conversations with no relations
But the moments in life that I never think twice about are what people think are the greatest
Man I'm praying (man I been praying), for god to be my reflection
Even though I know you above all this, I'm gonna see through my guns and still get it regardless

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
I'm calling my pasture I learned a few lessons
I give it the best in eternal direction
And no one can stop me or no one question
The work that I put in and who I was helping
Music my weapon of choice, projecting my voice in hopes that I'm reaching the masses
[---], never did it for myself, no regrets because I'm feeling in fashion
[---] for skill, I'm still smashing, with the new generation of assassins
Winning and my hunger ain't getting no younger, I only get stronger I'm flashing
Getting money, put family first, on the road to great to follow the curse
At first we lost, but oh man we searched
And only God knows that it ain't been perfect
But we moving in perfect time, and it's ticking it's ticking, the watch is still ticking
On the race against the clock it's my mission
Built for the heat, stay in the kitchen
And I never play victim, I just, cook it up so it's easy to digest
Invest cause I'm one of the wisest
Live as fuck, so the haters despise us
So I stay high, my mind business, watch my [---]
If I stay true when I [---]
And all my riders like young Dizzy hit the target
Through the Layzie Bone, imma get it regardless
