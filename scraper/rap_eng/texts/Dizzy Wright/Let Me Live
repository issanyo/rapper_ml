[Hook: ]
You won't understand
Until you look into the eyes
Of your protectors and see no compassion or humanity
No you won't understand
Until you look into the eyes
Of your protectors and see no compassion or humanity
Yo let me live, let me live
Yo let me live, let me live
Let me live

[Verse 1: ]
This the feeling you get when they promote you
I'm here to change lives and recruit the culture
Surrounding myself around the positive people that keep me focused
Combinate and coast and taking the 215 in motion
My niggas gonna be controlling
Already locked and reloaded
Big homie don't get roasted
For trying to keep up with these youngers
Looking funny for this money and everybody knows it
Take a shot and I'm toasted
Then take away from the moment
Bitches hoeing at the party that I'm hosting
Baby you ain't slick you see the body that you showing
Money make you rich but its your mind that keep you going
So pretty much my nigga my mind stay rich
How you a boss but treat your queen like a sideline chick
I got some game for you my raps is like an Einstein clip
Dizzy OG for the high times list
It's so amazing
Bold actions following bold statements
All I'm saying is

[Hook: ]
You won't understand
Until you look into the eyes
Of your protectors and see no compassion or humanity
No you won't understand
Until you look into the eyes
Of your protectors and see no compassion or humanity
Yo let me live, let me live
Yo let me live, let me live
Let me live

[Verse 2: ]
Back from New Zealand
'Bout to head on tour when I'm leaving
Woke up feeling blessed I feel this way for some reason
Noticing the way I get treated
Now me and my demons eating
'Cause none of the bad shit can stop me from the knowledge I'm eating
Meeting greeting shaking the hands of the different kind hearted people
It's a beautiful feeling to see everybody get treated so equal
So I hug my fans so tight don't ever let my love deceive you
This music is to succeed you
Just know you got this on lock
You falling down homie get up that shit gonna happen a lot
It's okay
Wake up everyday and you continue to be great
We see you
No conformation be you
Still moving forward telling y'all "fuck how they see you"
Fuck the evil let me live

[Hook: ]
You won't understand
Until you look into the eyes
Of your protectors and see no compassion or humanity
No you won't understand
Until you look into the eyes
Of your protectors and see no compassion or humanity
Yo let me live, let me live
Yo let me live, let me live
Let me live
