[Verse 1]
At the end of the night
It's the end of your life
And now you know its coming how you gon' spend it tonight?
I'm sheding my light

We living in a world of pain
Children, no Mommas no Daddies
Momma, why have me if you didn't want me?
To hold me and grab me, tell me you love me
Make me feel like a man
You left me in hands that wasn't my blood, I do not understand
I'm a part of your gut, you fucking slut
Now I'm fucking bruised and I keep fucking up, it's lose lose
When you living in sin, from not having much
I'm trying to stay focused but this negative shit it just calling me
When it gets tough I'm constantly smoking
They want me to slow it down but I'm speeding it up
Lord

[Hook]
Please forgive me for my sins
I committed to attend conversations you are in, Lord
I know they don't understand me spreading your message through my blood
Take these words, you are my family Lord

Can't be the end of times
What if today was the end of times?
What, what if today was the end of times?
How you gon' spend it tonight? (2x)

[Verse 2]
Humans eating humans
Nasty zombie shit
I don't got time for this we living but don't know what time we in
We scared of the change, they moving so fast don't know what to do
These kids they just lying it's not they like it, it's just they scared to admit that they scared of the news
So much fuck up shit going on in the world niggas scared that its gon' end
Tell that to a Mind big as a golf ball trying to go from a boy to a grown man
That knows about the last of earth believes in none but acts alert, don't want it to end we ask for birth

[Hook]
Please forgive me for my sins
I committed to attend conversations you are in, Lord
I know they don't understand me spreading your message through my blood
Take these words, you are my family Lord

Can't be the end of times
What if today was the end of times?
What, what if today was the end of times?
How you gon' spend it tonight? (2x)
