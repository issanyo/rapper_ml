[Verse 1: Derek Luh]
New kids on the block
Got that fresh new style
New bitch on my cock
And she's smelling like shenale
Can't exactly call me rich
But  the reception so well
Receptive to the knowledge I receive in detail
I'm rookie making plays they hesitant to play you
Contact my agent for them contract []
I'm fourth quoter clutch you contrast to my haters
And my bitch a []
She don't fuck with the papers nah
And I don't fuck with you haters
Did a couple world tours on the road getting baked
Now it's back to making hits I'm swinging apple to the fences
I played the underdog watch me shock you with a []
They ain't pay me no attention cause  [?]my complection
I'm pretty white boy shit I think they got it twisted
Maybe jealous of the look but can't deny the compositions
And I'm balling by myself cause I don't see the competition

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]

Praying to my heavenly father for showing me everything not to be
Became the king of my city now I can fit []
With all these niggas watching me
Man I feel like I'm at a fashion show
Cause they looking for that new shit
And I'm giving them what they asking for
Money on my mind I go to sleep think about my kids
A provider first but ride or die don't make me pop your lit
Smooth as I want to be but remember there is only one of me
Bumping me doing a hundred with a bad bitch and a marijuana leaf
Only god can judge me been trough a lot man life is ugly
It's easy to please a man that's [?] man pass the nuggy
I don't need much but a green card and not the one to get into country
Shit is lovely rocking sold out shows till I come off stage musty
I'm getting disgusting money
Had to recreate the atmosphere
They can't get nothing from me
Lets see where I'm at in a couple years they jump around
I go insane look what I gain they can't believe it
In the name of Yeezus ya'll can't tell me nothing

[Verse 3]
Turn me to a beast
Hello welcome to the jungle
Acting all royal till it's time to rumble
Surviving of crumbs I was young had to hustle
Gave 'em pre season now we living like we want to
This is what my name defends wrong for debating him
It's cool you can't shine all the time but you can name again huh
Want to waste my time
Going to hate my grind
All I can say it's fine it's time to bring it in
These niggas hating cause we got it now
Hoping it's going to knock me down
You crack me up like Bobby Brown
Repping for my [?] town
Trying to make my city proud
Go up to the judge tell [?] let Jimmy out
Came with her titties out some Jordans and a skimpy blouse
Only want the fame a hood rat I call her mini mouse
Grew up with bad boys but none of them could Diddy bounce
Had to get it the harder way so every penny counts
It's magic how we made it happen
I'll turn your favorite rapper into a laughing matter
It's more about who keep it than who got it faster
Inspired by my pops absence I'm a lucky bastard
I speaking fast then I turn the chapter
[?] only family matters
I'm trying to break the pattern conquer [?]
Oh you still hating nigga I'm feeling flattered

[Hook]
