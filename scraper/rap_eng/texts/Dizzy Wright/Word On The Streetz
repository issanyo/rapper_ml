[Intro]
Tryna figure this shit out
(Oh Major, don't go)

[Verse 1]
Word on the streets is some labels showing some interest
I'm ready to take off like I'm in the fucking Olympics
All about winning I'm Jordan back in '95 and 6
I want to get wealthy, if you not gonna help me then mind your biz
Oh, what I prefer is for my city to say that "the time was his"
And yes I'm referring to me
Headed for a early degree
Out high school to the league
Not for money for me
Know I'm in a comfortable space
Are you willing to pick up the pace?
I told my OG, "With all the travel what's the hassle?"
He told me, " What you rap about is only half the battle"
Admit it, don't build your castle and let your family struggle
I'm livid, money got less value than my fucking shadow
You niggas better free your mind, better free your fucking minds
I'm always right on time and ya'll ain't ever dropped a dime
It's fine, not gon' be salty or be sour
Ahead of fools like the time jumped up an hour

[Spoken]
Yo I been looking at my family tree and shit
I'm branched down off some crazy ass shit
But you know I see positive potential in my life
(Oh Major, don't go)
All I could do is smile and think about what I've already overcome with my mama with my brothers and my sisters
It's hard for ya'll to tell me anything at this point
(Oh Major, don't go)

[Verse 2]
Word on the streets is that the streets need a new hero
From ground zero, me, Demrick, Reezy, and Euros
When it's time to cut the check we gotta keep that love and respect
Not letting no one fuck me over or make me fucking stress
Nigga where your daily hustle?
Don't make it a situation
If you wanna speak on the shit you thinking you better articulate it
From Flint to Vegas, I'm out here still tryna keep it legit
Dealing with a domino effect
The shit leading to similar events
So I keep a team with sense
In my defense we do not attract niggas that's gon' pretend
Ya'll better get with it, eliminating all the hate and the critics
Committed, putting Vegas on the map, and who gon' say that he didn't
Coming with the vision and I'm ready
Everything I gotta earn
Now I'm feelin' like a expert
All I wanna do is learn
Steve Jobs with the net worth
Only coming with the max shit
This is me, I had to go and get in tune
Twisting them fronto leaves getting high just to find the truth

[Outro Spoken]
Nothing can come between you and your destiny
You and your greatness
Only you can stop you
(Oh Major, don't go)
You don't gotta lean on nothing to be great
Lean on your motherfucking mind
Lean on your conscience, lean on the fact that you can go find that knowledge yourself
Be your own inspiration my nigga
(Oh Major, don't go)
(Oh Major, don't go)
I hope them is tears of joy
(Oh Major, don't go)
