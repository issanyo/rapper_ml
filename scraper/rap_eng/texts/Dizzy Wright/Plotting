[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1]
Yo, you know when the timing is perfect
Pull up a connected dots and be conscious with every purchase
I'm, fully in service you seen it coming this engine running
Feel like I'm getting younger, but I'm no Benjamin Button
Tossing and turning I know I'm not laying here for nothing
Shucking my thoughts like concussion, rushing, bottom buzzing hope you hear me
Reminiscing on the days when my pockets was empty
20 years and I bet they could see my father in me I'm
Painting his picture, learning his life that was given for the ones that wasn't with him we still learning the system man
They don't give a damn, be a failure like your father
Life is fucked up, why you trynna make it harder?
Let me be! How far you thinking ahead?
Well it depends how much I'm making and how much I'm gon' spend
Preach! Nah don't preach, don't speak, don't repeat
Loving yourself is the only relief
No dealing with negative people, grab your phone and delete
Tone it down, make a point, then they hit you with the run around
So what dumb it lower take it lower than the underground
Niggas see me, they just need to hear me when I come around
I still feel like I ain't shown my full potential yet
Let the instrumental play so I can let my mental flex
Motivated, bad passes getting intercepted see me getting started, working harder, I ain't finished yet

[Hook]
While I got em' watchin'
They got me on my comfort zone and I've been plotting
They got me on my comfort zone and I've been plotting
Now all I gotta do is keep em watchin'
While I got em' watchin'
They got me on my comfort zone and I've been plotting
They got me on my comfort zone and I've been plotting
Now all I gotta do is keep em watchin'

[Verse 2]
In 20 years you can tell my son his dad was a hippie
Spirit like Bob Marley, that's why we named you after Ziggy
While the whole world getting trippy
I was different, definitely psychedelic like Jimmy
No bobokitty's my queen a cookie for really yo
Inviting numbers so we travel from the winter to the Sydney Australian summers
I'm truly blessed for the silent moments, I need em'
Haters always get ignored, silent treatment's how we treat em'
And I don't wanna waste no energy no more
On another niggas flaws
I mind my business and let karma do it's job
My personality will never let me be no fraud
Telling myself y'all couldn't handle all of my deepest thoughts
Hypnotising light it, man it's satisfying
Get your highest while you thinking let your fingers write it
How excited, life's your journey better be your pilot
Niggas flying over water when they landing get indicted
Fuck what these people think, they be on it
Life's passing better enjoy it, your passionate moments
Sadly the new deepest text is Mac and fake and their homie
Small talking in the open, in over her, how you growing, keep my thoughts in an envelope
Before I put em in the post
Seen the Mosin we be too focused on the instant emotion
Ain't no play and learning from it
Negativity and we ain't gaining nothing from it so my mind is set to something, feel like I

[Hook]
While I got em' watchin'
They got me on my comfort zone and I've been plotting
They got me on my comfort zone and I've been plotting
Now all I gotta do is keep em watchin'
While I got em' watchin'
They got me on my comfort zone and I've been plotting
They got me on my comfort zone and I've been plotting
Now all I gotta do is keep em watchin'
