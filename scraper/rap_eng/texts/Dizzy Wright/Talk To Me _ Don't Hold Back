Part I â€” "Talk To Me"

[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
Talk to me

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I need a girl with the most appeal
Know yourself so you know you real
Powerful with the social skills
Talk to me talk to me
Work smarter and I know she will
God faith and I'm a close the deal
Positive with the dopest feel
Smoke with me smoke with me

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Now we in a healthy stage
26 years and I ain't ever felt this way
But I'm still tryna find my life purpose
No money no options these days
So I smoke and listen to my mentors
Growing might switch your agenda
My mindset is vicious
I do not procrastinate and I never play the victim
Drink henney and vodka but I never mix them
Styling now like Jimi Hendrix
Pussy niggas in my mentions
Where was y'all when we was jumping fences
Now I'm months up in it
All my east side niggas coming with it
We done over did it
Time is ticking
Went from selling tickets
Now I watch my back with what I'm telling bitches

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I need a girl with the most appeal
Know yourself so you know you real
Powerful with the social skills
Talk to me talk to me
Work smarter and I know she will
God faith and I'm a close the deal
Positive with the dopest feel
Smoke with me smoke with me
I need a girl with the most appeal
Know yourself so you know you real
Powerful with the social skills
Talk to me talk to me
Work smarter and I know she will
God faith and I'm a close the deal
Positive with the dopest feel
Smoke with me smoke with me
