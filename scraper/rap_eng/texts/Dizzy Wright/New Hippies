[Intro]
Who Smoking?
Biggest stoners in the world
Who smoking, who smoking, who smoking?
Who smoking, who smoking, who smoking?
Who smoking with the biggest stoners in the world?
Who smoking, who smoking, who smoking?
Who smoking, who smoking, who smoking?

[Hook: B-Real]
I'm just puffing big with the Demrick
Smoking out with the Dizzy
Biggest stoners in the world, catch me blazing with the new hippies
(X2)

Who smoking, who smoking, who smoking?
Catch me blazing with the new hippies
(X3)

Who smoking, who smoking, who smoking?
Who smoking?

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Look, Crown OG with some King Louie
Good weed will make a bitch sing to me
Young nigga, I was taught to keep it fresh
Turn the sacred Sunday into a secret sess
So I'm like, "Show me who's smoking the best"
Tell them I need to invest cause I'm tryna collect
Take a big booty stripper on the jet fuel flight
I'm only here for the night, baby girl, I'm on deck
Pulling up, feeling like a legend
Smoking on the best, I'm in Heaven, I'm the dude like Devon
Give me credit, ready for whatever, niggas better debt it
Going a cappella make a motherfucker need a medic, gotta get it
I-I'm a hippy and I'm living to the limits
Peace sign with a C4 vision
Think I'm bullshitting and I pull that bomb out my backpack right now

[Hook: B-Real]
I'm just puffing big with the Demrick
Smoking out with the Dizzy
Biggest stoners in the world, catch me blazing with the new hippies
(X2)

Who smoking, who smoking, who smoking?
Catch me blazing with the new hippies
(X3)

Who smoking, who smoking, who smoking?
Who smoking?

[Verse 2: Demrick]
Who's smoking and rolling and getting high
Well let's take a ride on the other side
Light up like a flare, I'll put one in the air
Just keeping shit playing, so they know that I'm here
For the right price, get it done tonight
Guarantee the best weed that you smoked in life
With the Jet Fuel flight or the Cookie Delight
Werewolf of the wolf pack keeping me right
Got me higher than the Eiffel
Joint's on point fully loaded like a rifle
Fuck all y'all titles, I smoke with my idols, hand on my bible, the only life I know
So much game in my convo, I wonder what they missing
Put the joint to your lips, kiss it
Mary Jane please take away the pain, cause you're what I've been missing, listen

[Hook: B-Real]
I'm just puffing big with the Demrick
Smoking out with the Dizzy
Biggest stoners in the world, catch me blazing with the new hippies
(X2)

Who smoking, who smoking, who smoking?
Catch me blazing with the new hippies
(X3)

Who smoking, who smoking, who smoking?
Who smoking?

[Verse 3: B-Real]
I'm smoking with Demrick and Dizzy
Them hippies be rolling the gas, and they ask me to hit it
I'm with it, I lit it
You smell it, and want it
This green in my paper, I hold for a minute
Ha
And you could say I'm cold-hearted
Yes, indeed, I Bogart it
Man, that doctor got that retarded
Now I'm gonna jump up a few levels
Holler like a rebel, yell I got several
Purps on the [?] just sitting here and lit them
Rolling up [?] with them Skittles
I'm that G4 with that Jet Fuel
And we about to take flight, give me a dab too
My flower be shining like diamonds
Bitches wanna wear them on their neck like a crown jewel

[Hook: B-Real]
I'm just puffing big with the Demrick
Smoking out with the Dizzy
Biggest stoners in the world, catch me blazing with the new hippies
(X2)

Who smoking, who smoking, who smoking?
Catch me blazing with the new hippies
(X3)

Who smoking, who smoking, who smoking?
Who smoking?
