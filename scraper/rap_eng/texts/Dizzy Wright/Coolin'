[Pre-Verse Ad-Libs: Eso]
Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo

[Verse 1: Eso]
One for the sun, two for the love, three
For the four-twenty life I live (Ayy)
Bless me with a fresh leaf, let’s see
This whole motherfucker get lit
Unwind while I sit on the porch, let
Sunshine come and tickle my balls
I see sound on the mic, I’m trippy
In the greenhouse getting right like Dizzy
Uh, butt naked on the beach
Fuck work, man, I’m taking a retreat
(Damn right) Yeah, my feet are up
It’s all peace and love and that’s the way it’s gonna be
(Amen) All you haters are mad
Always got something to say
(Bless you) 'Cause I’m doing my thing
And I’m blowing my loud all up in your face
Hey, hey, yo, that cunt is cray, cray
They call me homie the clown, I don’t play, play
You better make way when my tape plays
'Cause like Kid Cudi I'ma make my own waves
Hit the pool in my swimmers, I'm coolin’, I'm chillen’
Let’s groove to the rhythm with beautiful women
Like yeah, shit yeah, isn’t it nice
Whole squad is up and we’re living that life

[Pre-Chorus]
Show up to the spot with the lik
Take a shot, roll a spliff like, "My music so loud"
Ooh, that vibe is my way
To get high with my mates every day, every day

[Chorus]
Pull up to the spot with my people on a vibe, yo
Coolin' with my fam, yeah my clan is super fly, hoe
Coasting in my Kombi like a calm breeze through them palm trees
So can I get a witness, yeah that’s the ticket

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah that’s the ticket, yeah that’s the ticket

[Verse 2: Bliss]
All day, every day, this is ballin’ how I’m livin’
Swish, wake up to the sunrise in my vision
Blessed, step out on the beach and I am sippin’
Fresh watermelon gin german, make a system
Cleansed, feel the breeze then I look at the sea just glisten
And it's looking sexy so I just jumped in that motherfucker
Mick Fanning done taught me some thangs
So ya damn right, I’m outchere surfin’, motherfucker
Yes, I get zen with the ocean, this shit is fucking awesome
I write rhymes out here floatin’, so welcome to my office
I never conform to the norm, I'm a fuck you to the system
I got independent co-pimpen in my blood that’s how I’m livin’
Now everyday is a weekend so every day is freedom
Thank you for putting me here, to all ya haters {kiss kiss}, I love ya’ll

[Pre-Chorus]
Show up to the spot with the lik
Take a shot, roll a spliff like, "My music so loud"
Ooh, that vibe is my way
To get high with my mates every day, every day

[Chorus]
Pull up to the spot with my people on a vibe, yo
Coolin' with my fam, yeah my clan is super fly, hoe
Coasting in my Kombi like a calm breeze through them palm trees
So can I get a witness, yeah that’s the ticket

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
Bro, why they wanna try me?
Is he OG? [?]
Funny how they calling him the best in the game
Then I come through clutch like Kyrie
If you thirsty you need you an IV
You suckers is looking dehydrated
We just been coolin’, harambae
And Bliss n Es go through the hoop, I’m DeAndre
And I feel like Pac when I go around the rim
Looking alive like Slim, I’m him
I had to take the harder way like Tim
And now we still moving until the road end
Ain't no way they could kill my high
Had too many shots, I can’t drive
I wip it out, 'baby, surprise'
Live your life, everyone dies
Hey, everyday I wake up high
Feel like a runner to 94 prize
Ill nigga, feel like the Illmatic Nas
And I came with that henny, let's vibe
They say I'm known for this [?]
Keepin’ it G is my duty, you haters always confuse me
Pretty women gon' pursue me
Drive through, I’m in ‘n’ out 'cause I gotta’ go

[Pre-Chorus]
Show up to the spot with the lik
Take a shot, roll a spliff like, "My music so loud"
Ooh, that vibe is my way
To get high with my mates every day, every day

[Chorus]
Pull up to the spot with my people on a vibe, yo
Coolin' with my fam, yeah my clan is super fly, hoe
Coasting in my Kombi like a calm breeze through them palm trees
So can I get a witness, yeah that’s the ticket

[Bridge: Rob Curly]
No, it don’t matter we don’t fit your frame
We’re picture perfect in a different way
So what we livin’ free and young?
We own the night until we see the sun
So witness us, live it up, you can call us crazy
Listen up, zero fucks given on the daily
In my mind I'm on a getaway
It’s like the world is a weekend every day

[Pre-Chorus]
Show up to the spot with the lik
Take a shot, roll a spliff like, "My music so loud"
Ooh, that vibe is my way
To get high with my mates every day, every day

[Outro]
The world is a weekend every day
The world is a weekend every day
The world is a weekend every day
The world is a weekend
Bitch, I though you knew who it was
Them B.n.E boys are back, kickin' up dust
Ya thought they was gone, y'all thought they was off they tits
Nah, they been cookin' in the woods, they off the grid
