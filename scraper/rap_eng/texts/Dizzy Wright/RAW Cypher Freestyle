[Verse 1: Like]
Yeah
Shouts to RAW Papers
I'm rollin' up as we speak
Hold up nigga, what's your angle
Nah man, we don't fuck with lame-o's
My niggas old school like Fila jumpsuits, 4 finger gold rings and kangals
You niggas look sus like tongue rings
Color contacts, heart tatts, and rainbows
I'm everywhere that you can't go
Sorry but, that's how the game go
Hey bro, lay low, say yo
For the right peso
Niggas on payroll really gon' spray though
Trade your fitted cap for a halo, god bless
Ahh yes, niggas don't want no contest, we complex
20 niggas outside your complex, if you want flex
I'm leanin' in my whip
Don't pass no lean, I don't need no sip
I'm lookin' as clean as clean can get
She starin' at me, better get your bitch
Been in corners evading traffic
Slapping bass all in these streets
Got that A$AP on repeat
You still got A-Traks in your jeep?
Used to rock a wave cap when I sleep when I sleep, nah these dreads swangin'
Sex so wild, we be messin' up the bed frame and
Sex so wild, she be leavin' with her leg shakin'
My man Scrilla on this beat we keep your heads bangin'
It's like

[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]
They say I can take the world if only I would desire it
I'm standin' on the burial ground of the Leviathan
They're finally denyin' my birth right and my blood line
Flood guys, general minds, under the drug high
Flippin' white, put a nigga to sleep like Nick at night
Pick advice, I stick with it, I get-get it
I slip into the pussy, I'm slick like liquid is
My dick did it, Damage a critical hit
Quidditch ain't the only time you'll see me out in the field
I need potions, my HP low
Game of Thrones ain't only on HBO
Clash for the crown, cut me, acid in my blood stream
Steam clean blood stains out of my jeans
While you fallin in the field
We ballin NFL
Same team, same plays, but itâ€™s not a regime
Bling bling, I'm the king and I'm rockin' with that
And we rockin' with RAW

[Verse 3: MOD SUN]
H-I double P-Y, you could probably see why
I'm out the seventies, heavenly sorta divine
When I put the letters together the stars realign
And I shoot 'em down *POP POP* with a peace sign
Living like a rasta, hair like pasta
Wanna talk style? Okay, I already lost ya
Duke Ellington in the Uber ride
Ridin by my old high school now I school the high
Deeper than a scuba dive
Who am I? I-I-I-I just believe
That actions define you
So let me remind you
The time to hesitate is already behind you
So I stay scratchin off my bucket-list
I'm in love with this, so unconditio
It's no competitio, when it comes to this
It's no compass, I go my own way
Rebel to the revelent, mind of an elephant
Never forget, I will not drown in the rising tide of conformity
I will not play the minor keys like the majority
I will not, let authority ignore me
I'm moving forward, for the ones who march before me
All power to the flower, burning chocolate by the hour
Origami with the raw paper never twisted poorly
Order me more me, see me in your city
No fans, got friends show respect with a zippy
Came through with a gypsy, name Mod Sun
But she call me that hippy

[Verse 4: Dizzy Wright]
Yo
I'm the dog that you always see the cat chase
Vegas, we finally in the rap race
Who want it with the boy, give it 100 with the boy
Niggas get destroyed thinkin' I ain't that great
So I'm smokin' as I'm fillin' up the ashtray
Plottin' on my next move
Swagged out like a Neptune, turnt the fuck up
Pissin' out Henny out my dick in the restroom
My New Year's resolution is deuces
I guess I'm only human
What would you do if you're seein' your dreams
As zoomed in, I mean represent and tuned in
And uh.. 'gain, I heard they want to box me in
And feed me lies and cop new trends, I ain't with it
Of course I'ma try new shit with these writtens
But I ain't finna slave the fans that don't get it
As I twist these rhymes and I flip these words
One day you might get your turn
Well let it resonate, I'm too clutch, I don't hesitate
So if you light it then it will be burned
Flick the flame and light the raw, fight the cause
Or don't fight at all, y'all ain't no better than the law
Willie Lynch wrote a letter for the job
But we blinded, so I just kill 'em with kindness
Yeah look LV's finest, I'm timeless
But y'all don't even feel me though
I ain't tryin' to get a head start, find the kind of hard
Niggas hit the top of the charts and still be broke
Wait, you tell me they was waitin' on a break
I reload every time I let the sound off
Drop a mixtape and hit every state
Now the only way I'll have downfall is if the ground fall
Ya bitch
