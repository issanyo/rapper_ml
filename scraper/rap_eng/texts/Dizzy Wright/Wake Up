Talk to them
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
I hope my voice, I hope my lyrics
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
Man I hope that I, come up
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
I hope my voice, I hope my lyrics
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
Man I hope that I, come up

[Verse 1]
In the streets I was always running in and out
In the drought tryna find a way to stick it out
I was bout the money never really in the house
Quick learner and observer who had it figured out
Fuck it, I’ma get this world upon this dizzy shit
Smoke weed and teach niggas about the willie linch
I will never turn my game off
Annoyed and we brain washed
Mind getting fucked by a chainsaw
I seen the future in my home girl
Went into her own world and got a little nigga
2 years later, 18 with a baby and a baby on the way
And that nigga is out the picture
God damn I don’t get ya
Settle as the victim, it ain’t about abortion
It’s about better decisions
Pretending to be happy, angry with the way you living
Got me tripping
I just pray to God the power in my motherfucker lyrics sing

[Hook]
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
I hope my voice, I hope my lyrics
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
Man I hope that I, could, talk to them
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
I hope my voice, I hope my lyrics
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
Man I hope that I, could, come up

[Verse 2]
Ah, the whole world seems commercial
We all off, the whole world need rehearsal
Women getting verbal, getting more into women
Becoming distant, focus on independent
It ain’t try to tell me, it ain’t what it seem
My mama's vision seem to turn into my dream
And it’s crazy cause bitches throwing they pussies
Not knowing I hate barbies, I’ve been searching for a queen
Black raised with panther soul, I got a voice but I ain’t stupid
21 years and I finally met my daddy
Just to find out he a gangster like Frank Lucas
And I love it
And not so I can brag, but it’s finally helping me understand
Who I’m becoming
I’ve been running from a lot
And I finally got my shot to be exposed
To enough to make them watch
I hope my lyrics can motherfucking

[Hook]
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
I hope my voice, I hope my lyrics
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
Man I hope that I, could, talk to them
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
I know my voice, I know my lyrics
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
Man I hope that I, could, come up

[Verse 3]
Ah, I know what you prolly thinking
This young nigga spit lyrics with the meaning
Waking up niggas while they sleeping
I’m rude, it’s the wound of mine
That you hear speaking
Told them if I ever got the chance, I would
They ain’t believe me until I showed them that I could
My mom good, I know you want me to stay safe
But I’m teaching my generation how to learn from all they mistakes
I found something I’m good at
And I’m proud of me, a young black man
That turned the planet into a prodigy
Our society fucked, but I don’t mean to fuss
Or trying to start shit, but look at what they feeding us
But it’s cool my nigga, cause you got swag, huh
And bitch you don’t care, cause you just got that bag, huh
They killing us in this what we call living life
Seems like niggas left it up to dizzy right, so I’ma

[Hook]
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
I hope my voice, I hope my lyrics
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
Man I hope that I, could, talk to them
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
I hope my voice, I hope my lyrics
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
Man I hope that I, could, come up
