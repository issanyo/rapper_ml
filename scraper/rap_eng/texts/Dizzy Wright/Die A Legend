[Intro]
K-K-Kato on the track bâ€”

[Chorus: Demrick & Oktane]
I got a couple more rolled, now I'm ready ([?])
This world will drive you crazy if you let it (if you let it!)
They're coming for you 24/7 (all day!)
Just know when I go, I'll die a legend (die a legend!)
Back against the wall (back against the wall)
Manifest it all (manifest it all)
Back against the wall (back against the wall)
Manifest it all (manifest it all)
Back against the wall (back against the wall)
Manifest it all (manifest it all)
Back against the wall (back against the wall)
Manifest it all (manifest it all)

[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
[?] Quierro mas, no espero, no [?]
Coming up, no, I never had a lot
Had the hand-me-down shoes, but I never had the box
No, no, young Venezuelan, mommy native, pops immigrated
I don't listen to a fuckin' thing, when they goin' voice opinions on my situation, nah
I deaded some homies I couldn't trust, like matalo, matalo, matalo
When money affectin' your loyalty, I look at that shit like I got to go
Adios, tell you to your face, I don't sneak diss, ya
I put them groceries up in your fridge, now you somebody that I wouldn't eat with

[Verse 2: Price]
I'm seein' faces in these smokey walls
My cousin died, I really couldn't cope at all
You would think it's luck, but I spoke it all
Pure manifestation, hard work plus patience, hold up
A lot of niggas in my hood want to change up and do better, but they lack information, uh
A lot of rappers might be good enough to get a chain and get they bread up, but they lack innovation, uh
Tie up the lace, yo, I'm the first in the races, uh
They call me Price, I'm allergic to fakin', ya
She feel life when she turn on the album
She love the fact I remind her of Malcolm
They comin' for me like the tax ain't paid
Like drug raids, child support, they want a real one to fade
Back against the wall, hands all cuffed up
They wanted me to fall, now they done fucked up

[Chorus: Demrick & Oktane]
I got a couple more wrote now I'm ready ([?])
This world will drive you crazy if you let it (if you let it!)
They're coming for you 24/7 (all day!)
Just know when I go, I'll die a legend (die a legend!)
Back against the wall (back against the wall)
Manifest it all (manifest it all)
Back against the wall (back against the wall)
Manifest it all (manifest it all)
Back against the wall (back against the wall)
Manifest it all (manifest it all)
Back against the wall (back against the wall)
Manifest it all (manifest it all)

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
Yo, divin' in your bitch like Michael Phelps
Fresh up out the pussy had to light an L
[?] I'ma send 'em right to hell
Push to the limit, nigga, might as well
Murder, murder, kill, kill, one week
Killers move in silence, let the gun speak
Fuck your baby momma and your auntie
Leave a nigga slumped on the front seat
Hundred round king, let the bums be
Gators on me, Crocodile Dundee
Y'all niggas lookin' like lunch meat
Came from the bottom of the concrete
Bitch, pipe down when the boss talk
Khaled told niggas this the cloth talk
My whole team savages, y'all soft
Kato make it hit 'em like a sawed-off

[Verse 4: Dizzy Wright]
24/7 that's his, I told 'em say less 'cause I got the keys
"One Week Notice" for the album, this is finna be a breeze
Think about what you gon' say to me
Do my thang, how they gon' hate on me?
I'm takin' off, bitch, do not wait on me
I'm stayin' wavy on this Kato beat
I got my shot and I didn't want to waste it
Tell 'em this is faith and self-determination
Party-poppin', pull up hit 'em with Marcus Garvey knowledge, that's a combination
Manifest this in a lot of places, back against the wall, wall, wall
Until I'm in your top ten conversation, you ain't 'bout shit, hell nah
I talk to 'em

[Verse 5: Oktane]
I said I was gon' be a legend, now I gotta go be a legend
It's like watching God in the session, they wanna see how we gon' catch it
It's like Lebron full speed with a press in front of him with under two seconds
He would take the floor and stretch it, I take the flow and then I stretch it, you missed it now
Try to keep up, see they hear all of us and start to see the difference now
You see I'm a man on a mission now
Let's execute the plan with precision now
They'll expect the front, hit the windows
Dizzy from the roof with his brim low
Keep your spirit high when your ends low and get it ten-fold

[Chorus: Demrick & Oktane]
I got a couple more wrote now I'm ready ([?])
This world will drive you crazy if you let it (if you let it!)
They're coming for you 24/7 (all day!)
Just know when I go, I'll die a legend (die a legend!)
Back against the wall (back against the wall)
Manifest it all (manifest it all)
Back against the wall (back against the wall)
Manifest it all (manifest it all)
Back against the wall (back against the wall)
Manifest it all (manifest it all)
Back against the wall (back against the wall)
Manifest it all (manifest it all)
