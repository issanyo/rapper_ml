Nice to meet you, Mr. Freeze

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Show the world no one can hold me
Guarantee they pay attention
While the whole world talk
I get shit done, now pay attention
We ain't made no trades
My day ones came from the beginning
Y'all don't know no loyalty
This is more than me

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Yiggity-yaw
Ooh, my palms is itching
I'm too time-specific
I like constant swings
But I can't lie, I fucked all kinds of bitches (yes, I have)
What can I say, I'm vicious
Look at all these Swishers
My crossover nasty
I'm used to them screaming why I kill it (why I kill it?)
My niggas, they know me
They know how I get down (how I get down)
I get shit done
I might leave the scene to make a plate
Pull up with that real soul food
No GMO's and make your day
Hit Freeze for that 808
Okay, okay, okay

[Verse 2: Reezy]
Ayy, listen close, nigga, pay attention ('tention)
Food for thought, now what you ate for dinner (yah)
Killed the scene, but I made a living (woo)
Bad hoes wanna pay a winner (you do)
Fuck niggas hating from afar
See you out I swear that you the star (fuck out)
I ain't tripping, that's what you was taught (damn)
Me and mine cut from different cloths
Getting shit done, you just talk (talk)
Foreign whipping, nigga, you just walk (skrrt)
Loyalty, I wear that on my heart (yah)
With the same niggas from the start (bet)
Gold rolly, see the red shine (shine)
Got rich, but never switch sides (nope)
Black power, hold the fist high (high)
Bitch, we on the way to get ours
