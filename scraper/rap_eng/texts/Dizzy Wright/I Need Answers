[Intro: Matt Lauer]
The images from this weekend's violence in the streets
Stores being looted and riot police with dogs barking and charging protesters
It all started with the fatal shooting by police of an un-armed black teenager
The FBI has now opened an investigation of the shooting
The shooting of eighteen year old Micheal Brown has opened a wound in the community

[Verse 1 – Dizzy Wright]
Never thought today god would take my friend
But I’m dealing with it
The police is at it again, and they killing the innocent
They consider us gangsters if we don’t walk around acting like brothers is feminine
Y’all run off adrenaline
How you obey the law by harassing a citizen?
How we supposed to feel safe if you always act scared of us?
Somebody must’ve told you a lie
Not surprised that they calling us animals
Living in poverty, tryna survive
They say don’t be mad at the cops, 96 percent killing is black on black crime
They don’t want us to be outraged
But how we ever gon change if we don’t even try

[Hook – Dizzy Wright][x2]
Why, do they kill us when they feel uncomfortable?
This shit is dysfunctional
Lost one of my homies about a month ago
Why, do we always feel like a target?
If I know it’s because my skin, what would you call it?
I need answers man

[Hook 2 - Nikkiya]
Please tell me something
How out of the blue, the one in the black
Get shot down for nothing
I just don’t know, it feel like some nonsense
Feel like some bullshit
Please tell me something
I need answers man
All of the sudden, boys in the blue shoot boys who are black
Shoot them for nothing
Where they do that at?
I just don’t know it feel like some nonsense
Feel like some bullshit
Please tell me something
I need answers man

[Verse 2 – Dizzy Wright]
It’s no science to it, they treat us bad cause they see how we living
Tell us take what was given
The government been against us since the very beginning
What if we took our guns off us and put em on y’all
And then asked god for forgiveness
Tryna get through to the public, marching and screaming for justice
Only get us pushed to religion
Hands up, don’t shoot!
We beg to be humans, we must got a snake involved
If martial law can happen any minute
Then what’s an unpaid suspension if you break the law?
Killing us isn’t the answer
Establish facts before the propaganda
Look, these regular people with regular lives
Badges should come with a body camera
Why every chance they get...

[Hook]

[Bridge – Nikkiya & Dizzy Wright]
I need answers man (I need answers man) [x2]
We need, answers

[Verse 3 – Dizzy Wright]
What now, fight back, bust back till they scared of that
Cause Willie Lynch wrote a letter on controlling black people
And we still ain’t repaired from that
Might as well pull out the rope
I’m not pointing no fingers, I’m blaming us both
It’s obvious we can stand for the right things
But media plays a problem with the things they promote
Fighting in a lose lose battle, tryna bring peace but it don’t come natural
Walking in the streets, holding up signs
And they throwing tear gas at us like the shit don’t matter
It was a peaceful protest before looters
We the violent ones, but they the shooters
Can’t be teaching these kids you gon be mistreated by the police for being a human
I mean what kind of future is that?
What it take to get back?
I’m a man, I know better
Maybe me and my folks should vote better
Or maybe I should get out this country
Cause they aren’t gon ever respect us until we start fucking up all of their money
But until then, pump your fists if you still in
Cause we will win, time to get angry

[Hook + Hook 2]
