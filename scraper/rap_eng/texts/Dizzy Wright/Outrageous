[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Heard you needed real, come get some
America looking like a sitcom
They don't care about a nigga outcome
They really only focus on the income
Black versus white, who's race?
Everything looking outrageous
Shit feels so outdated
But we still deal with it on the daily, I swear
Heard you needed real, come get some
America looking like a sitcom
They don't care about a nigga outcome
They really only focus on the income
Black versus white, who's race?
Everything looking outrageous
Shit feels so outdated
But we still deal with it on the daily, I swear

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Black child got black waves
Got to teach them to be brave
Ball up your fist and raise
Let them know we can't be phased
Now everybody on a cop head
'Cause this unarmed kid got shot dead
Look, Pac said, "niggas need change"
Now the younger generation all hot-heads
They start this rage into black folks
My granny need water, I'm in jet mode
I feel like Bryson with a T R A P S O U L
Until I accomplish all my rap goals
Daddy went to jail when I was ten days
Twenty years gone as an inmate
Mama struggling to got the rent paid
Now I'm in the streets tryna have a big day
I realized now what it feel like
I know some real niggas doing real life
White boy kidnapped for six months
I heard his lawyer hit him with a sick life
Doing more time for the same crime
I can't even leave past state lines
You can tell this outrageous
Jail time feel like slavery
Only keep them there for the paycheck
And they wonder why niggas got big guns
The government only want the income
The homie got killed with a day left
I feel like I could be next up
Life move fast, better catch up
Cops shouldn't be above the law
We all human, leave it up to God, aye

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
I wonder when it's really gonna change, mayne
I wonder when we getting out the game, shame
A player got to scrape a dollar together the bill
Still do make ten, they gon' want fifteen
Out to check, ain't no helping the Rolodex
So you do a little wrong just to come correct
Sacrifice your freedom for the Louie V's
YSL, and every letter in the alphabet
But them laws on the low, casing
Life ain't Scarface the movie, face it
They waiting on you to be stupid, basic
You're just another number in a cell, cadence
Propaganda the promotion of the notion
The only way you get out the hood is with the stove and
You're living fast and dying young is where you're going
Don't fall victim to the trap door that ain't showing
It's bigger than the block that you stand for
Or the shot that you got out the bando
'Cause the law pull up with the handle
Ain't nothing cool when the streets filled with candles
Another shooting on the front pages
Another crying family, over they baby
Another murder played out on them stages
Wonder where we live and it's so outrageous
