[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
Yo I wanna dedicate this song to all my Flashy Inc. niggas man
Fuck these nigga's keep moving forward
All we got is each other

[Hook]
Playa' play on

[Verse 1:Dizzy Wright]
Talk down on us from rumors and lies (rumors and lies)
They seen the potential they knew we would rise (would rise)
These little nigga's running shit on your side
They swag on you bitch and shit on your pride
(Nigga we shit on your pride)
We lost some nigga's and made some mistakes
Found the real and getting rid of the fakes
Had some downfalls but what can i say
We stick together at the end of the day
(Nigga that's loyalty)
We growing up and they see that we getting smarter with it
Working harder it's different when you put your daughter in it
High school pimpin' the real life livin'
And all of my nigga's taking care of they children
(Nigga you better believe)
Discipline for the benefits that we finna get
The world is watching we just gotta to make them feel the shit
We in a position to really really kill this shit
No time for games its time to get it in
Remember what i told you

[Hook:Dizzy Wright]
Playa' play on

[Verse 2:Dizzy Wright]
Swag ain't never been a problem
Na what's been a problem is you've been a problem
Think we got more than we got when we in survival
We in the bible when yall in denial
(Player loosen up)
To move it up you've got to do enough
Be the who is that before you be the new what's up
Take your time elevate your mind brodie
You gon' shine if you don't be doing stupid stuff
(Listen and you'll learn)
Motivation for closer ages is doper shit
Swag it out and then mash it up with my older shit
Keep the message Reflecting off of what really works
We really making it happen i know you noticed it
(Man these nigga's see us)
We believed when they was knocking the team
Disagreed to fuck with nigga's for cheese
Planted a seed and grew me some og smoking like an og on me
Uh my pops cool he said fv done found the best
He remind me of the man that taught Malcom X
So if i sound the best just know that I'm around the best
Educated blowing smoke up out my chest
(I gotta keep my smoking)
Illustrating my loyalty through poetry
You nigga's hating ya'll spoil me with royalty
I understand if they dont really understand
But deep down everybody is a fan
Player 'member what i told you

[Hook]
