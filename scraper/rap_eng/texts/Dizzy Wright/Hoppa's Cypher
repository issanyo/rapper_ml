[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
I eat rappers, save skeleton bones
Welcome to the jungle bitch I ride an elephant home
Get to slapping mother fuckers, get the hell out my throne
Start foaming at the mouth like 'what the hell am I on?'
This that DJ Hoppa, Jarren's the new teeny bopper
Face fucking bitches, nice guy wipe the semen off her
Hit the exit bitch, head was my prerequisite
D’s get to spinning on the Chevy like the exorcist
Lifestyle's reckless, snatch a nigga's necklace
Stunting for my friends like "Watch a nigga check this bitch"
"Hey bitch, you better have my mother fucking money by Thursday"
"I'm sorry mom just go with it, I'm trying to act hard in front of my friends"
Back to murdering wizard shit like Merlin
Stick a javelin through your abdomen fucking nerves of them
Probably didn't occur to them that Jarren's about to murder them
SK will reacquaint you niggas with the earth again
So keep yapping and that gat's squirting
My girlfriend is in the Klan but unaware that she's a black person
Hop on the plane wearing a black turban "I'm a terrorist"
Not a real one idiot, the rap version
A-town's finest, bitches popping out my bathtub like
"The royal penis clean, your heiness"
Moment of silence for my nigga that passed
If I pick this bitch up she gotta fill up my gas
Cut to the chase, you fucking if I give you some cash?
DJ Hoppa on the beat so niggas know we gonna spaz
Razor blade Benton, bitch, I wouldn't play with him
And we sharing needles, bitch, you about to catch AIDS with them

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Crazy thoughts getting lost in my membrane, that's what I get for being outspoken
Observing I can always sense things, speaking how you thinking with your mouth open
It's a party when I'm crashing on the set
So high I'm accidentally ashing on her chest (Oh, my bad)
These MILF bitches keep on asking me for sex
So I tried the shit but I ain't never happy to reflect
Gotta learn to live with regrets
You not giving up the neck, you probably single with a pet
We all know the bitches that be sleeping with a cat
Sneaky bitch got me sneaking out and leaving through the back
If that wasn't an option would you back it up and drop it
Fuck around and trap me in the closet
Stacking like I'm Jerry Stackhouse coming out of college
If you coming out your panties I ain't coming out my wallet
Bitch I'm watching you
Doing that thirsty shit on Twitter gonna be the reason I unfollow you
She say that it's important to me
But good pussy good weed, that's normal to me
You need game I got it bro
The formula cheap
It was a day contract she been on for weeks
These bitches heating up when they be cold in the streets
Turning bitches out that's older than me

[Verse 3: SwizZz]
See when you show love it gets reciprocated
I see it as flattery when I'm imitated
Invested a couple thou' when I renovated
Turned my bedroom into a studio and orchestrated
My plan to make a living off this rap shit
To pay back more than a fraction
Of what I owe to everyone that help me see it through or make it happen
Won't be long before we cash in, living outward I imagine
Exactly how I planned it
A couple handouts but I tripled what I was handed
It gets quite easy distinguishing who was candid
Some homies lost faith and sooner or later vanished
Damnit, Fuck it, I ain't tripping over spilled milk
So fuck it, when times are hard I'm willing to help
I better myself so I can better everyone else
Around me, San Fernando, Los Angeles County
Just thought I'd mention the home base
Disrespectful niggas get stomped like home plate
Still taking jack shots, ramu, no chase
8 shot in and still ok, it don't stop
Pour another till I'm feeling woozy
Even the bitches acting bougie
Uncapable of starring in they home movie
With a few scenes, a couple in the bed, then backyard jacuzzi
Making additions to two Zs
And we're straight like the face your girl gave
When she lied about being laid
DJ Hoppa let the record spin and rotate
F-U-N-K Volume biatch!

[Verse 4: Hopsin]
This is what I'm giving you, funky shit to listen to
Came up in the underground and now you trying to mimic who?
Ain't familiar with this flavor, homie, I'll reintroduce
Taking it back to when S-N-Double O-P had dropped that gin and juice
Give me a minute to
Fuck up your mental with a pencil over this instrumental that’s how a menace do
I'm launching missles, it's simple to cripple
I got a bite like a pitbull, that's why they love me and they ain't feeling you
My life is a tightrope that I walk carefully
So many bitches on my dick I need therapy
My girl walking out I'm trying to grab her screaming "[Sarah] please
You said you loved me I thought you would be there for me"
I lift the bullshit then Hopsin makes the parodies
My man's so famous he could hook me up with a pair of jeans
And a gangster rap shirt with a snapback
It makes my past easier to laugh at
If you a hater then you need to get your ass slapped
You don't wanna see me cross your path like a black cat
I'm everything that your ass lacked
FV nigga and that's that
I call names, if you respond that's a fat trap
Remember me the ugly fucking nigga with the mad rap
A sinister's what I've been known to be
And you know I'm about to kill this shit with Hoppa on the beat
