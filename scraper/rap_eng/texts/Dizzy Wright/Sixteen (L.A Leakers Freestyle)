[Verse 1:]
Aye 'yo it's world peace until this whole world fall to pieces
You waiting on my downfall, they waiting on my releases
I'm giving these niggas a reason, Vegas best secret
I don't want to change the game on these rappers, I want to freeze it
Believe me, accelerate from the knowledge that I generate
Clean up a murder, my bitch was having a gym a day
Went away with no pressure, came back stronger then ever
I'm truly on it forever, this flower grew from the desert
Sunny hot, they play tracks from way back
Like I ain't the next nigga to be where Kendrick and Drake at
But right now it's me against the world in a cage match
They hate me or they embrace that
We the rap revolution
Setting stone, 'yo mind is being paralyzed and ruin
Taking shots I swear I couldn't be blocked by Patrick Ewing
Had to book Dizzy Wright for a show a couple of racks will do it

[Outro:]
You punk bitch! x2
And it- and it don't stop
Ha sixteen!
Da da daaa x2
Haha Funk Volume in the motherfucking building
L.A Leakers in the motherfucking building
If you see me, give me weed nigga
Da da daaa
Haa Dizzy Wright we out here
World Peace Forever
