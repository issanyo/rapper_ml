[Hook: Gunplay]
From the jump, I been a straight G
In the trap no AC
From the jump, I be swangin' iron
AK, lay it down
From the jump, selling straight dough
You ain't a felon, you been tellin' like a straight ho
From the jump, you don't wanna see me
From the jump, you just wanna be me

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Mayday mayday, big old AK
Big black guns, another payday
Big black Mercedes, big black dreads like I'm singing Reggae
From the jump, you been a chump
You been a pussy and your bitch been a slut
You never had a spot, never held it down
Never had a Glock and you never loaded rounds
You never went to work with a nigga like me
You never had dope, never had a white tee
Fought my fights by my motherfucking self
Earned my stripes like a motherfucking breath
You never had it hard, you never had to barge
You never had a momma that ain't never had a car
Tell another nigga story, shit you never live
You niggas never slit, rapping shit you never did

[Hook: Gunplay]
From the jump, I been a straight G
In the trap no AC
From the jump, I be swangin' iron
AK, AR, [?]
From the jump, selling straight dough
You ain't a felon, you been tellin' like a straight ho
From the jump, you don't wanna see me
From the jump, you just wanna be me

[Verse 2: ?]
From the jump we had [?] nigga
They gonna need a witness, no Jehovah nigga
From the jump, all I wanted was a chump
In the 7 tray dunk with a chopper in the trunk
From the jump, the streets taught me how to strap up to survive
From the jump the streets knew you was a motherfucking lie
From the jump, I been jumping out of Benz's with my buddies
[?] getting money motherfucker
Machine guns from the jump when we beef
No tags, black bags, yellow sheets
Ill 1's nigga took to the dough
Still standing tall, getting money on the low
Now we got extendo's on every stick I can get it on
My paper long enough to knock out niggas while I sitting at home
Poppin' [?] champagne
Fuck her [?] she keep looking at my damn paint

[Hook: Gunplay]
From the jump, I been a straight G
In the trap no AC
From the jump, I be swangin' iron
AK, AR, [?]
From the jump, selling straight dough
You ain't a felon, you been tellin' like a straight ho
From the jump, you don't wanna see me
From the jump, you just wanna be me

[Verse 3: ?]
I know they never wanna see me do good
Niggas never really gave a fuck about me
So I don't really care how you feel about me
Jealous ass nigga, broke opinions ain't gonna stop me
I'm still getting to the paper, I don't need a nigga favors
Self made, stayed loyal, been [?] been hating
From the motherfucking jump, [?]
Chopping bricks for the low but all the money in the cut
Getting o's from the [?]
Mad foo (yeah aiight)
My dogs swing, I'ma chump em
Swinging iron like [?]
My mirror only time I thank a nigga
The hood don't even respect when your [?] this
No love, no respect, no convo
Unless you got 39 for that [?]
