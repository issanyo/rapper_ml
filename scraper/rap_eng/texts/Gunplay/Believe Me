[Intro: DJ Epps]
Epps, whaddup? 1305
The beat, living legend

[Verse 1]
Gunplay comin' down, black Benz
Gettin' white money, hangin' with my black friends
Been broke and I've never been back since
Big dog, smokin on cat piffs (cat piffs)
Started from the ground up, now look
Folk tryna blow the whistle on a foul crook
I'm a real street nigga ain't no doubt about it
So I don't even care when my album droppin'
Ridin' foreign, tourin' with a warrant
MVP on the bench still scorin'
Ain't a blood but I'm bicken back being bool ('tell em)
Ball 'till you fall, burn a stack, be a fool
Lookin' out for my dog with my last hundred
While these niggas beg a bitch 'bout gas money
Draw guns like an artist
Air it out, hair down like a calm breeze
I'm a motherfuckin' livin' legend
While you has-beens reminiscin'
Gotta keep it trill with ya home team
Or keep an itchy finger on a chrome beam

[Hook: Drake]
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
