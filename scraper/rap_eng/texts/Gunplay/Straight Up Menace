[Intro: Gunplay]
It ain't my fault, look how you made me
On this asphalt, shit get crazy
Everybody here die young
Keep my hand on the motherfuckin' iron

[Hook: Gunplay]
Straight up menace, out in the streets
That's why heaven, looks so out of reach
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout (straight up menace)
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout (straight up menace)
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Straight up menace, out in the streets
That's why heaven, looks so out of reach
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout (straight up menace)
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout (straight up menace)
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Sworn in it, born in it, tormented, already
Call my momma a liar, said it'd be all better
Now it's amazing, making numbers off a art letters
Thug life livin', only long as ya'll let us
I say a short prayer instead of writin' long letters
That [?] a motherfucker, huh, ain't it?
The booth is my canvas, picture art painted
I got that brown goin' 'round, sniff all veiny
Used to call me poor baby, momma mortgage short paid
So high, last twenty-nine years, all jaded
I made it and ya'll hate it
Now my neighborhood is gated and I'm still drug related
Everyday stay sedated, boy it's real out here
You damn sure gon' fold if you ain't made a steal out here
That's why I'm still out here
Yoked the whole block, cost about a dollar bill out here
You know the drill out here

[Hook: Gunplay]
Straight up menace, out in the streets
That's why heaven, looks so out of reach
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout (straight up menace)
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout (straight up menace)
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Straight up menace, out in the streets
That's why heaven, looks so out of reach
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout (straight up menace)
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout (straight up menace)
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Straight up menace
Down four flats, when it come to my business
You know I'm handlin' that
Whip it quicker than you scramble a egg
I'm sho' 'nuff that nigga, so don't gamble or bet
And if it's more you want
Then I happily accept, phone
Listen to that bullshit, I'm smashin' in your 'ject
Now I finally realize I'm actually a threat
'Cause I talk that gun shit and actually aware
Success my revenge now
I give a fuck, but pretend not
Fuck a c-note, give me a M-9
Ya'll gon' let me in this bank, bet my left nut
'Cause the quicker I get rich, the less trouble
Blood money stain, tryin' get it how we can
Closest homie slain, shit's insane
I got money now, I thought you said that I'mma change
M-M-G, triple-C till I'm left without a frame

[Hook: Gunplay]
Straight up menace, out in the streets
That's why heaven, looks so out of reach
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout (straight up menace)
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout (straight up menace)
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Straight up menace, out in the streets
That's why heaven, looks so out of reach
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout (straight up menace)
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout (straight up menace)
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
