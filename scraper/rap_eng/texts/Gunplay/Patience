[Intro]
I can't let that slide
Nah, not this time
Payback's a bitch, revenge is a must
Vengeance is mine

[Verse 1]
Elevated, mass slaughter, premeditated
Livin' like I never made it
Like I ain't got heavyweighting
Pussy boy don't ever play me
Double drugs, serenading
Slugs in ya marinating
Two gloves, Gary Peyton
Praying for some peace, but these niggas play for keeps
Whole hundred [?]
Pop a muthafuckin' paper [?] a laker
Just murdered death kill, ain't no city that you're safe in
And I'm making out a promise to your [?] and your mama and your bitch
I be beating with no muthafuckin' condom
Niggas dying over chains so they fryin' over change
Got a missile for the issue with a tissue for the pain

[Hook]
Shots fired, niggas die, hate crime (whoa x5)
Shots fired, niggas die, hate crime (and the war goes on)
Shots fired, niggas die, hate crime (whoa x5)
Shots fired, niggas die, hate crime (and the war goes on)

[Verse 2]
Only thang on my mind, payin' back what I owe
That's a bullet to the head, that's a blade to the throat
And I swear to the Lord, he goin' straight to the morgue
For not knowin' what he doin', cause there's a line you don't cross
Now you did, now you dead
Drop a bike on ya head
Yeah you made that muthafucka, time to lay in your bed
I'ma take till I [?] till your box close [?] till your face all patched up
Laying on asphalt
Down to my last draw
Down to my last [?]
Down to my last bullet
Pull it and blast off
I don't be playin'
That's all I be sayin'
When it comes to murder, ain't a yard I won't [?]

[Hook]
Shots fired, niggas die, hate crime (whoa x5)
Shots fired, niggas die, hate crime (and the war goes on)
Shots fired, niggas die, hate crime (whoa x5)
Shots fired, niggas die, hate crime (and the war goes on)

[Interlude]
I'm on the way
Whoa [x5]
I'm on the way
All I want is white
Whoa [x5]
[?]

[Verse 3]
The game ain't ever been based on no sympathy
Only thing matter who gonna die or who gonna kill me
Only thing I care about you not knowing my whereabouts
[?] no dinner on my table top

[Hook 2]
Shots fired, niggas die, hate crime
Shots fired, niggas die, hate crime (and the war goes on)
Shots fired, niggas die, hate crime (we on the way)
Shots fired, niggas die, hate crime (and the war goes on)
We on the way

[Outro]
I ain't got enough time
A lot of money, its gonna be fun
Lotta homework, on yo own turf
We on the way, be patience
