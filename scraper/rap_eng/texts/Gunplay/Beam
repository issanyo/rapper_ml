[Verse 1: Trina]
Do your choppin on madison, diamonds bright like I'm legit
Who the fuck you think you challenging
I’m 4 seats, you the riderzin
I'm paper tagging, you cabinet
I'm a boss bitch, burking bag in it
I tell the truth, I’m bad as fuck
And I'm hella cute
You never seen a bitch
Got swag you could fill up arenas with
And I fuck the shit with no benefits
You gotta rob something, go flip the brick
I'm going harder, 50 racks that bail harvard

We balling bitch, we the ?
Where the money nigga, bring your cars out
Say my name, you gonna bring your cars out

Ain’t no problems, just mollies and bottles
And models and adults, and condos
She swallow, ball up, I'm too fast to follow
You know I go all the way

You know how I go, mash away these hoes
If you look out for one, you gotta look out for all

Suck the dick tell em tie, and look me in my eyes, had to make the head fine
I go live, mdma, a few times I was simply the bay

I don’t fuck with no hoes with no benefits
You better hit the stones, that's why I'm tripping bitch
Trina got shown popping red bottoms
Bitch you ain't my ?mama, I'm going harder
And my bitch on molly, smoking ganja
We ride around bumping oldless carter
I taught her how to shoot and load the chopper
About to teach her how to mix the coke with water
And if she can't, I'ma get a hoe that's smarter
Big and berg you see the piece, them vvs is shining like bean

Beam, bea I shine like beam, beam, beam, beam, beam, beam
