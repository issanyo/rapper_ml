[Intro: Gunplay]
Yeah everybody hit me up, want me to walk to the club tonight
She told me bring some pills
I said cool
I'm finna slide, finna get dressed right now
Pick up that line, hoe

[Hook: Rick Ross]
She want that Oxycontin flow, my Percocet pills
A touch of Cocaine, tell me how that feels
She want that Oxycontin flow, my Percocet pill
That Adderall is next, she'll love my cheap thrills
She want that Oxycontin flow, Percocet pill
A line of Cocaine, tell me how you feel
She want that Oxycontin flow, that Percocet pill
That Adderall is next, she'll love my cheap thrills

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
I drop 2 bars in my soda
I'm so composed when I swerve
She sprinkle blow in the doja
Told me it's between me and her
I got a dime in the basic, basically treat 'em like dirt
I'm gettin' chewed tryna steer
Hope no Police in my mirror
Hoe, I mean that sincere
She fuck with dope boys and swipers
She blow on both of my dices
I fell in love down her throat, then got, Ghost in the crisis
Already know how that go
But on a whole 'nother note
That money (?)

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
She want that Oxycontin flow, my Percocet pills
A line of Cocaine, tell me how you feel
She want that Oxycontin flow, my Percocet pill
That Adderall's next, she'll love my cheap thrills

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Double R's on the wheel, lady on the grill
Gave me chills, crack the seal
Pour the line, crazy, maybe
Brought a line, I brought a pill
Right now I feel high like I just said goodbye and turned the world
Still greezy, pissin' grease, a beast
I'll burn up all this fur
Watch lil gloss and disco lights, between the line of disco white
Blowin' on that Citgo pack, prayin' that this lick go right
I'm from the mud
Only mud, it ain't no Sprite
Double tap that thang, front and back like that hoe like

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
She want that Oxycontin flow, my Percocet pills
A touch of Cocaine, tell me how that feel
She want that Oxycontin flow, my Percocet pill
That Adderall's next, she'll love my cheap thrills
She want that Oxycontin flow, Percocet pill
A line of Cocaine, tell me how you feel
She want that Oxycontin flow, the Percocet pill
The Adderall's next, she'll love my cheap thrills
She want that Oxycontin flow, Percocet pill
A line of Cocaine, tell me how you feel
She want that Oxycontin flow, the Percocet pill
The Adderall's next, she'll love my cheap thrills
She want that Oxycontin flow
