[Intro: Sample & Ghostface Killah]
Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special technique of Shadow Boxing
I should slap all ya'll niggas for coming in my fucking face with that shit

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Fuck nigga, now it's on
Bitch I don't wanna hear it, dial tone
Pussy jumping up and down like a Dow-Jones
Got a pistol damn don't say I won't
I'm Gunplay shit, but play I don't
I could fuck any bitch any day I want
Treat her anyway I want, I'm about to overcharge
Rose over odds time to over ball
Fuck all the laws, suck on my balls
For free on the house, beam beam I
Fuck nigga play get your locker cleaned out
Long ass money looking like a green mile
Got a gritty ass grin and a scheme on my smile
Got the dice in the air and the cheese on the ground
Right under my slipper and I'm about to clean house
Reject your deposit, that denied
Rich and I'm reckless, same damn time
White in the brown in the same damn line
Jupiter Speedbar Jack on the job
Walk around, no shirt, gat in the drawers
Nigga WHAT!
