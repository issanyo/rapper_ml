I got real niggas that drank, real niggas that smoke
I got real niggas with bank, real niggas who broke
I got real niggas with OZs, real niggas with bricks
Real niggas who blow trees, real niggas who sniff
Real niggas who snort, real niggas who won’t
Real niggas who sip lean strapped up at fifteen
Real niggas that gang bang, real niggas that claim blood
Real niggas that crip walk, show them boys the same love

I know real niggas that snort mollys

Real niggas that's rich and just wanna see you eat
And gonna front you a block a two and get you right back on your feet

A real nigga gon' bounce back
Lame niggas gonna pump up

Pussy niggas be playing but my money ain’t no game

Real thief, that’s all I see
Real ratchet, that’s all I am
Steel rachet, that’s all I need
