[Chorus]
I'm looking for the baddest ho
I'm looking for the baddest boppers in here
Don't sweat no bitch cause pimps get chose
They're screaming out my name they know iv'e been trill
I'm poppin yes, I'm poppin bitch, I'm poppin yes I am
I'm poppin ho, I'm poppin bitch, I'm poppin yes you know that i am
I'm poppin bitch,I'm poppin ho, I'm poppin yes I am
I'm poppin bitch,I'm poppin ho,  yes you know that i am

[Peryon J. Kee]
Lookin for the hoes on the daily
Lookin for the ho with the ass
Pull up and i swerve I drink cold syrup
Ho yeah im from the curb Bilderburg gone glass
Hoes on dick, bitch nigga sit
No don't trip ,we got pistols
Might come down in a Harley D, Kawasaki, Suzuki, Ninja or Jigsaw
Throwed on gin, bitch get your friends, and tell them whats up
No eights just tens, every state we been in
Hoes pay and they want to suck us
Poppin ho, droppin hits pimp hoes, do shows and im havin paper
I beat a bitch ass, i beat a nigga ass, like a pimp champ young flashy playa
Turn a ho head, got fame got bread now they want to be down with us
First they scared now the hoes line up and they want to be down with hush
Peryon J got boppers in a trance, young playa serenade like Luther
Ride Red with the Ruger, a south side loser, and a sixth street nigga booed up
Wassap

[Chorus]
I'm looking for the baddest ho

Don't sweat no bitch cause pimps get chose

I'm poppin ho, I'm poppin bitch, I'm poppin yes you know that i am
I'm poppin bitch,I'm poppin ho, I'm poppin yes I am
I'm poppin bitch,I'm poppin ho,  yes you know that i am

[Gunplay]
I'm hopping out my foreign whip with a pocket full of fee
And these pussy niggas know what im bout and who i be
All these bitches suckin dick but they ain't suckin mine for free
She got to break the purse, rap my verse, and break me off a g
Thats how they swangin where im from, ain't no question bout that there
Throwin shots between limbs untill your lungs got no more air
Im poppin yes, im poppin ho, she dropped it low on pappadeaux
This babby bad she pay the tab then roll me up one Optimo
Trippin if you think its a game and you try to play me
My best friend is my FNH and we goin to take it to the grave
Ain't one bitch bone in my body ain't no fear off in my heart
Just one bullet in my chamber and im poppin off the start (pow pow pow)

[Chorus]
I'm looking for the baddest ho
I'm looking for the baddest boppers in here
Don't sweat no bitch cause pimps get chose
They're screaming out my name they know iv'e been trill
I'm poppin yes, I'm poppin bitch, I'm poppin yes I am
I'm poppin ho, I'm poppin bitch, I'm poppin yes you know that i am
I'm poppin bitch,I'm poppin ho, I'm poppin yes I am
I'm poppin bitch,I'm poppin ho, you know that i am
