[Intro]
Bank filled to the brim, spilt on my rims
Windshield to the wind, cup of gin to the chin
Jewels on my limbs, do not attempt
Reach and I teach you, stay at arms-length

[Verse]
Bank filled to the brim, spilt on my rims
Windshield to the wind, cup of gin to the chin
Jewels on my limbs, do not attempt
Reach and I teach you, stay at arms-length
Streets so gray, sky stone gray
"Where the bitches?", let's see what the iPhone say
Money won't stop and time won't stay
Broke muhfuckas say crime don't pay
I hide no face, still find no trace
A rap since I put that fire on that lace
Hostile since coke in the nostril
Skinny as pasta with a big ol' Mossberg
Maybach machine, all you hear is cha-ching
Never flew what I flown, all you seen was the wing
All black up from the shoes to the ring
Includin' the mink, I am as rude as you think
Back on the turf like I never left the nerf
Feel sorry for my mother, should've never had the birth
I never had a gift, damn sure had a curse
Now who next to climb out the back of that hearse?

[Outro]
Yea, you already know Gunplay
Don Adolf, Logan
Hail Logan ha-ha-ha-ha
