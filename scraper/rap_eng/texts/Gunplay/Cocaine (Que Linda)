If you don't fuck with Evil Empire
Well then you're just a bitch ass trick
Cocaine's a hell of a drug

She say she from Medellin, I'm tryna cut er
She say she from Medellin, I'm tryna cut er

[Hook]
Cocaina, que linda

Cocaina, que linda

[Verse 1]
Colombia, Medellin
Bogota, you ain't said a thing
Cali, the bodies
The alleys, the violents
The beauty, the bitches
The trenches, the henchmen's
The glory, the vengeance
The 8 story house without fences

[Hook]
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
(She say she from Madison)
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
(She say she from Madison)

[Verse 2]
Pablo, Grizelda
Cold world, no shelter
The barrios, the poverty
This shit you see on TV â€“ comedy
The culture, the cartel
The vultures, the pallbearers
The crooked police, they won't bail
And the baddest of the baddest bitch is on sale

[Hook]
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
(She say she from Madison)
Cocaina, que linda
Just watch that pretty girl rock
(She say she from Madison)
