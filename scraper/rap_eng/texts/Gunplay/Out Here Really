[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Tell the nigga on top I'm a dog out of prison
That's the only way a nigga gone sleep (only way)
Gas sip and go, take a stack out the roll
That's the only way a nigga gone eat (only way)
Selling fake dope, duct tape, rope
That's the only way a nigga gone make it (only way)
Anything over one kilogram
That's the only way a nigga gone take it
You and me both got a beat cut from the same cloth
Or a nigga can't trust you
Fuckin' with a nigga paper that's a major problem
Type of shit that make a nigga wanna bust you
I don't give a fuck 'bout nothing but going broke
That's the only way I'm gone cry
Pussy nigga playing them pussy nigga games
That's the way a pussy nigga die
First you gotta crawl, then you gotta fall
That's the only way a nigga gone ball
Fucking with a shot caller, AK47
Only shot a nigga gone call
Never tell, never told, never crack, never fall
That's the only way that you can be a G (only way)
Never have, never will, you can bet a hundred mill
That's the only way that you can be me

[Chorus: Mozzy (& Gunplay) x2]
We ain't in the house in the street with this shit
Yeah, we in the street with this shit
They just knocked a nigga down
Down the street from the bitch
Bought an SK, gotta sleep with the stick
I be out here (I be out here really)
I be out here really (I be out here really though)
I be out here really though (I be out here really)
I be out here really (I be out here really though)

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
I never would have though she would turn on me
The good die young we don't turn 40
Lil Rob died, I really loved homie
Willing to take it there, spill blood for him
Got it out the mud, pure [?] on me
Being broke is a mans shame ain't nothing pretty
Called up [?] man need another 50
Now I'm up a couple band days 150
Promised all my niggas that they coming with me
Finna killa coordinate another [?]
Sip 'til I slip into another coma
Level up on these niggas they got nothing on us
Niggas know me then they know I got it off the corner
Niggas know me then they know I got it off the corner
Keep one up top, nigga on my momma
Saw 50 in my chop nigga on my momma

[Chorus: Mozzy (& Gunplay) x2]
We ain't in the house in the street with this shit
Yeah, we in the street with this shit
They just knocked a nigga down
Down the street from the bitch
Bought an SK, gotta sleep with the stick
I be out here (I be out here really)
I be out here really (I be out here really though)
I be out here really though (I be out here really)
I be out here really (I be out here really though)

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
Where ya'll was when them things kicked back?
Where ya'll was when them things kicked back?
Where ya'll was in the middle of the sweep?
Where ya'll was in the middle of the sweep?

[Verse 4: Mozzy]
Where those niggas out when them suckas slid through?
When them suckas slid through
Fuck a bitch nigga and fuck a bitch too
You know I ride K and 40 Sig too
Where those niggas out when them suckas slid through?
When them suckas slid through
Fuck a bitch nigga and fuck a bitch too
You know I ride K and 40 Sig too

[Chorus: Mozzy (& Gunplay) x2]
We ain't in the house in the street with this shit
Yeah, we in the street with this shit
They just knocked a nigga down
Down the street from the bitch
Bought an SK, gotta sleep with the stick
I be out here (I be out here really)
I be out here really (I be out here really though)
I be out here really though (I be out here really)
I be out here really (I be out here really though)
