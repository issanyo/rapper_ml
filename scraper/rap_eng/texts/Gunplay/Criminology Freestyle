[Intro]
Shout out to the Chef!
Back on the streets of Bogot√°
(B-o-g-o-t-a) (B-o-g-o-t-a)
Where life is worth 25 cent
(B-o-g-o-t-a) (B-o-g-o-t-a)
That's one bullet
(B-o-g-o-t-a) (B-o-g-o-t-a)
Look here, Gunplay holla at them man

[Verse 1]
First of all dawg
Yeah its loaded, oh lawd
I can spot a sucker on sonar
Kush bud longer than the cones are
My real life realer than my songs are
White bitch booty flat slap bones on
These hoes pogo on my trojans
With my clothes on
Another molly and I'm outta this ozone
Lights camera shows on
No miles on the odom, no, none
Bogota blizzard no cold front
Smoke some pour some snort some
She a good girl but I made her ho some
Watch a player play rollies on both arms
Watch meddelin form like voltron
Mink coat, get your poach on
Low life, get your roach on
I'm a coach y'all

[Verse 2]
I'm a hero
Was a kid on skid row
Slid slow, drive by here it go
Push a nigga wig back to a year ago
When the tattoo teardrop way it go
Just look for the bloodstain, there it go
Where the birds? Where the parrot go?
My revolvers a merry-go
Increasing the odds of your burial over a stereo
Top dollar imperial cheerios
You a pussy nigga period
How a bitch ass nigga call another bitch-ass nigga
A bitch ass nigga? Silly really though
Rolling with snakes, skating with antidote
So much fish-scale sunk the whole bananaboat
If one get hit still Geronimo
Now who wanna swim down piranha row?
