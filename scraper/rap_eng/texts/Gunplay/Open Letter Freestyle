Living legends, no pardons in murder gardens
(Hustlin', hustlin') since then, we've been on since
Dealing dimes in adornments
When they rhyme, man it's all myths
Now my dimes all tall milfs
And my rap lines all gifts
I'm in the paint, I think I'm Paul Pierce
Bread right, headlights, y'all all deers
Hoes wanted black bottles, but I brought beers
They was so disappointed that they fought tears
Cooked all the base, bring me more snares
You ain't a soldier if you ain't pay war fares
Fuck it, from here to Nantucket
Roll a damn nugget, ain't no other way to put it
Junkie jit wrote a hit in his hoodie
Oak on the rifle and the steering wheel's wooden
Just put me anywhere near money
Bet I won't make it fair for not one of ya
I got groceries, 31 onions
Make hoes walk the plank 'till they made eight bunions
Pimps keep pimping, hoes keep hoeing
I-N-G stands for I'm not going
Crackers ask me question, I'm not knowing
I gave a life sentence back, now y'all owe it

Y'all gon' learn today
