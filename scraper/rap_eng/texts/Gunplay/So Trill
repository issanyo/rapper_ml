[Intro]
I can't feel sometimes
Feel like it ain't even real sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes

[Verse 1]
I'm certified, fuck what you heard about
Heard about how he got murdered through the word of mouth
Robbed the wrong nigga, might as well have murked himself
Knife to the windpipe and you could skip the shells
They paid [?]
Fighting demons all the time, another title bout
Another win, another loss, it's more to write about
Chain smoking on the Porsche, can't put the lighter down
My future lookin' like it's sucka' free (yup)
My new pretty Phillippino bitch is such a freak
She wanna love me, but she told me that I'm such a [peak?]
I pick her up, I knock her down, won't see much of me

[Chorus]
Shit's so trill sometimes
Out here in these fields sometimes
That I can't even feel sometimes
Feel like it ain't even real sometimes
Shit's so trill sometimes
Out here in these fields sometimes
That I can't even feel sometimes
Feel like it ain't even real sometimes

[Verse 2]
I won't apologize for praising dollar signs
Trying to make my commas cry, fantasizing homicides
This a blessin' in my hood, no vest and I survived
Drum squad on the way, you know what that's about
Paper to the ceiling, table full of villains
Choppin' up some [?], just capers and some killings
Soldiers and lieutenants, Porches and new Benzes
Even though it seems senseless, I keep swingin' for the fences
On a mission for the million, I don't need me no dilemmas
Feds been watchin' since TV's had antennas
They tryin' thread the needle, but them people can't pin us
But the task force won't stop 'til the task finished (forever)

[Chorus]
Shit's so trill sometimes
Out here in these fields sometimes
That I can't even feel sometimes
Feel like it ain't even real sometimes
Shit's so trill sometimes
Out here in these fields sometimes
That I can't even feel sometimes
Feel like it ain't even real sometimes

[Bridge]
(So trill, so trill)
I can't feel sometimes
Feel like it ain't even real sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
(So trill, so trill)

[Chorus]
Shit's so trill sometimes
Out here in these fields sometimes
That I can't even feel sometimes
Feel like it ain't even real sometimes
Shit's so trill sometimes
Out here in these fields sometimes
That I can't even feel sometimes
