[Verse 1]
Ya'll niggas so vagina
My coke is so Madonna
My fishscale so Parana
Put Chrome on Yokohamas
I can't trust my hoe no mo' can't leave no dope around her
Roll a hundred dollar stroke she snort that roll right off the counter
Drop that [?] on the digit
Caught a bird that just a pigeon
Got a chicken on the stove
Bout to whip it like a sissy
What y'all knew, 'bout this here
Cocaine [?] pop an act [?] same time after
[?]
D-Boy fresh, three Corvette
Need more kush, from D-bound West
And some head, mouth, skull, and brains
When she saw the chain thing what a sudden change

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Pop rocket straight drop lock it
On the bottom like
If it dont
They want that A1
Interns, lamer
Whip white for Trayvon
Hoes know I ain't save one
Ridin' around with my high Benz
Tweakin' hard on nine Benz
Two birds and they Siamese, no consignment on these
Cocaine, dope game, those things you not bout'
3-6, Ozis, you know I'ma take nine out
Call the trap my J
Jump out the gym night and day
Cook it all with more on the way
Gotta break the cook if you know by the way
But you know that though
Tell me whatcha know bout' though
Tell me whatcha know bout' though
