Again,  ah, on my case, umm
My co-defendant, umm, he gave a statement, you know, in detail of what happened and that broke my heart, so that's...you know I had surveillance against me
I had the victim which called the police, and on top of that I got my co-defendant "spilling the beans", when all he had to do was just shut up
It is what it is though, you know, I'm not mad at him now, I'm not...I don't...you know, I don't hold no grudges, I'm just moving forward and I know...you know what I mean, it just gives me more...not, not, not to trust nobody, we could be cool, but at the end of the day, when the laws draw down on you, not too many people 'gon hold that water, ya know what I mean, not too...not, not, not too many people is not 'gon crack, a lot of people 'gon crack
The toughest of the toughest, the most gangsta' of the gangsta', the killers of killers, the this'es of the thats, they...they, you know... nine times out of ten, they 'gon fold

I was like, "nah, it's impossible, it's impossible"
But when we was in the court room, umm, the...the ah...the state attorney, you know, she unveiled the ugly truth
