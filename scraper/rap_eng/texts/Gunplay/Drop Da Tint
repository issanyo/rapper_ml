(Pre-Hook)
Hanging out the window with a big oak timber
I just skied a slope, it ain’t winter or December
Pull the drive by shootin with some mob-tied hoodlums
Don’t be yelling God now when them cars start loopin

(Hook)
I pull up and drop da tint, pull up and drop da tint
Pull the drive by shootin with some mob-tied hoodlums
I pull up and drop da tint, pull up and drop da tint
Pull the drive by shootin with some mob-tied hoodlums

(Verse 1)
I roll up, my tint drop (drop)
The stick pop (pop)
Hit the gas, get ghost through the grid lock (lock)
Watch and see how one key will get the grid locked
Watch and see how one me will get the crib hot
Your cunts can’t stop in my ruthless ways
Fuck around and turn this back to John Doe and boobie days
Think I give a fuck what your computers say?
Have you pissin in your Trues when my Ruger raised
I go hard like a wet square
Left everybody on the floor when I left there
Chopper knock a motherfucker out a fresh pair
Gunplay, gun smoke til it ain’t no fresh air

I pull up and drop da tint, pull up and drop da tint
Pull the drive by shootin with some mob-tied hoodlums
I pull up and drop da tint, pull up and drop da tint
Pull the drive by shootin with some mob-tied hoodlums
(Verse 2)
AR15, yay scraight (straight) off the beam
Aye, they want that free base, I’m on the fee chase
Forgies, no cheapskates, orgies in each state
More beef with each steak, fuck your release date
I’m just that goon out that Maybach platoon
Now bitch betta not move, slide it to me smooth
I brung my gun, and a blunt for my lung
And a cup for my rum and a stick for my drum
I’m out here, come see me, this oak big as a tree be
When I go, write my testament in graffiti
All I know I got a piece and I’m pissin on peace treaties
I know how that go, we bout that war, believe me
We be…
