[Intro]
Put my phone on silent
I gotta hear this, uh
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Slanging girly in the morning, early, got to catch the rush
MOB and that's a must, COD, I got no trust
And I be BMFing, a million won't last a month
All I need is one, PNC and that's enough
And I ain't even crank up yet, but bet I'm gassin' up
When my Prada press that pedal, bitch, you better fasten up
I exhale and ash the blunt, inhale a hundred times
Not even hundred one couldn't bring back how it was
When a brick was seventeen and you ain't have to rob your plug
When rapping was an art, now this shit a juug
Get you couple dollars, few jewels, and some pussy
I'm getting a little too power drunk, now I'm on that bullshit

[Chorus]
I got a problem and a plan, revolver in my hand
Trying to keep it cold, but y'all won't understand
That's why I roll with the Bible on the dash
That's why I roll with the Bible on the dash
I got a problem and a plan, revolver in my hand
Trying to keep it cold, but y'all won't understand
That's why I roll with the Bible on the dash
That's why I roll with the Bible on the dash

[Verse 2]
Cutting corners on Coronas, trying to buck up on a bonus
Out here on my lonely, last stogie, but I'm focused
Now I know, friends parallel the foe
And all that good pussy leave you parallel to broke
I asked the pastor, what's the fastest way to heaven for a bastard
With a tarnished past? Give me your honest answer
With all this Hannah Montana, without the Arm and Hammer
Am I gonna get the slammer or the casket?
Trying to keep a level head rolling on this rocky road
Is a full-time gig, trying to keep this Glock cold
I got the work, water in the pot, need a hot stove
And a down ass bitch, and a squad down to roll

[Chorus]
I got a problem and a plan, revolver in my hand
Trying to keep it cold, but y'all won't understand
That's why I roll with the Bible on the dash
That's why I roll with the Bible on the dash
I got a problem and a plan, revolver in my hand
Trying to keep it cold, but y'all won't understand
That's why I roll with the Bible on the dash
That's why I roll with the Bible on the dash
