[Skit 1: Baby Boy]
He make my mama unhappy, we make his ass bleed
On the real make him feel the steel
Long as she happy, he got his life
Won't be no strife
And I hope his ass hear me too nigga
I hear you

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Loud ass lil nigga yeah I hear you
But them guns won't save you
Words won't shield you
Life worth less than a ten cent bullet
Cause theres a box even the best get put in
Arms cross in a suit that he prolly look good in
In a yard full of graves you can fit a whole hood in
Rifle on the dresser now your life is under pressure
One clean head shot make the wall more messy
You know nothin' bout that life youngin'
I know this kid in an old school ride
Daddy died youngin' got hit 6 times less than 100
Thats what happens when a hunter catch up with the hunted
Guns, butter, pistols, powder, sticks, bricks
Is you trill or coward?
Make up your mind can't straddle that line
Middle finger to the punk judge gavel in time

[Skit 2: Baby Boy]
Now what are the guns? The guns that's the real estate
The stocks and bonds, art work
You know shit that appreciates in value
What's the butter?
Cars, clothes jewelry, all the other bullshit that don't mean shit after you buy it
That's what it's all about, guns and butter baby
You little dumb motherfuckers

[Verse 2: Cormega]
Judges is blind
Streets are watching eagerly talking
Either gossip or tell police when freedom is offered
You see where you heart is the deeper the chargers
The steeper you are for a legal involvement
Keep dirt far from home
Feds will sweep your apartment
Pardon me it's your mommas
That's the first place they search when they bringin' the warrant
Never sleep you be on the corner dreamin' of ballin'
With no game plan risking you freedom for jordans
Pay attention it cost less than paying a lawyer
Takin' advice can hurt more than takin' an offer
That came from the court full of racists
Who judge us on basis of colour  we graced with
They hate us we slaves no longer
Get your mind right and money right
Keep your grass low, profile us [?]
Don't flash your abundant life
It's what you make it word to mother
Survival of the fittest guns or butter

[Skit 3: Baby Boy]
You know the problem with you little niggas?
You think you know everything about the damn world but you don't know shit
I see you got yourself a little business going
Well, that's good you make that paper
But when you making paper you gotta learn some rules that go with it
You gotta learn the difference between guns and butter
