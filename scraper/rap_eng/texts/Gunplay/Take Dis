[Intro]
Yo, uh uh, this strictly for the snorters (laughs) yeah nigga

[Hook]
Take dis' to the brain, huh, hold up, lemme' see how imma' do this
Take dis' to the brain, look, check me out though, uh
Take dis' to the brain, and tell me how quick you feel the drain
Take dis' to the brain, and tell me how quick you feel the drain

[Verse 1]
Take dis' to the motherfucking head, to the nose, to the face, to the wig
Can't smell my cologne, or taste my ribs
My shit a faucet on drip, leggo
Lost five pounds in the last five hours
And got a photo shoot, still tooting chowder
Look at me wrong and imma' shoot the whole crowd up
You don't know what you're doing, imma' show you how to
Mirror, strong, wildin' out in my asylum
No straight jacket, I'm Jupiter Jack Daniels
What up bitch, let me cock your spaniel
Wash a nigga dreads, clean out a nigga dandruff
My nuts sweaty but she licked them already
New Bugatti still pumping eighty-seven unleaded
I'mma hog all my money, take it all with me to heaven
Bitch we living in hell, how the fuck he the reverend
Junkie, flunky
But I keep it, one-thou' wild funky
Like a nigga should, like a real nigga would
Fuck all them jelly back fed pecker woods
I'm on my square, feet never see air
Whacking all these niggas like I'll never see the chair
You looking at my shoes like you never seen a pair
Slice a sweet swisher, put my medicine in there
I ran out of money, now a nigga betting beer
When P-Nut died, the only time I shed a tear
I be hunting for the cunt, I'm a pussy-predator
Drop a new bitch if the newer one got better hair

[Hook]
