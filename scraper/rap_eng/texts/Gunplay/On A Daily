[Intro]
That's on a daily!

[Chorus]
She get wet and I get baptized
She outta' pocket, she get chastised
Musta' been a pimp back in my past life
You musta' been my hoe, that's why you fantasized
Broke a purse first day we glanced eyes
P-i-m-p nigga, I'mma die that
Carry on, won't deny that
Besta' check your hoe, I know were mine at
[?]
Cocaine, steak and wine at?
Running through the money like a finish line
I don't know that pussy nigga, ain't no kin of mine
All it takes for me is one call to kill a vibe
The chopper take a hot boy and chill him out
That's on a daily
Thats on a daily
That's on a daily 'round here partna'
We the only ones sellin' 'round here partna'
That's on a daily
Thats on a daily
That's on a daily 'round here partna'
We the only ones sellin' 'round here partna'
That's on a daily
Thats on a daily
That's on a daily 'round here partna'
We the only ones sellin' 'round here partna'

[Verse 1]
Keep my bible on dashboard
While I'm burning rubber on the asphalt
I'm bustin' moves without a mask off
I came for the money, that's all
Sat the slab on the chrome wheels
Everyday we run a play, eight phone bills
Hot pussy give me cold chills
Do this for the whips and gold grills
Oh hell, "You know I'm on that shit right?"
"You knowin' what I'm with right?"
Saw them at the red light
Had to slide by 'em with the lead pipe
The pistol paint ya' shit and turn ya' tears white

[Chorus]
That's on a daily
That's on a daily
That's on a daily 'round here partna'
We the only ones sellin' 'round here partna'
That's on a daily
That's on a daily
That's on a daily 'round here partna'
We the only ones sellin' 'round here partna'
That's on a daily
That's on a daily
That's on a daily 'round here partna'
We the only ones sellin' 'round here partna'
That's on a daily
That's on a daily
That's on a daily 'round here partna'
We the only ones sellin' 'round here partna'
