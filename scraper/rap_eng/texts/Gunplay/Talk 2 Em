[Hook: Gunplay]
Somebody better talk to em
Speak what's on your mind
I only hear the numbers that come after dollar signs
Talk to em
Speak what's on your mind
Careful what you saying when them killers 'round

[Verse 1: Noreaga]
Glass of white Zinfandel
Call in my nigga Dell
Slang shit, gang thick
That shit is for sigadale[?]
Now everything is rigadelia
From now on, I order work
Like a scale, I perform
I got my young'un with me
He ain't smart so I the nigga dumbing with me
You'll probably get it later
Noreaga, wild connects with Al Quaeda
Godfather, kush stuffed in the Garcia y Vega

[Hook 2]
Somebody better talk to em
Speak what's on your mind
I only hear the numbers that come after dollar signs
Talk to em
Speak what's on your mind
Careful what you saying when them killers 'round
Talk to em
They must not know, they must not know
Somebody better talk to em
They must not know, they must not know
Somebody better talk to em


[Verse 2: Noreaga]
Pour the Cris, please, pass that
You still hand-to-hand, I'm way past that
I roll blunts, and ash that
I'm on my white boy party shit, crash that
So look in my eyes and see that I'm real
Don't gotta talk about the things that I did
You better talk to em
I walk through the hood and I'm by myself
And the Tec-9 is under my belt
It goes..

[Hook 2]

[Verse 3: Noreaga]
Blow ashes in their face, call em "Ashy Face"
Run a marathon, dumb dudes get knocked, erased
Decapitate, I hire they head off
On a platinum main course
This is the main source
Live at the barbecue, double dimmers an obstacle
Blow green tropical, science is fiberoptical
I maintain, this is my shit
Heavy metal style, I had a hood most pit

[Hook 2]
