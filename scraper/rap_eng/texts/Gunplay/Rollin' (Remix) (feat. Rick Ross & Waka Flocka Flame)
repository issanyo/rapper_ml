(Female voice) (Gunplay)

My dog says we gone be rich one day. Lay it down; don't say a sound, gunplay!

(WAKA)

This for my niggas on the block and hallways

Ball every Monday through Sunday {Rollin! }

()

Every time you see me on the set boy I'm (ROLLIN)

Rims, whips sittin' on them shits boi I'm (ROLLIN)

Snatch a dime nigga wanna rip cause I'm (ROLLIN)

Nigga cause I'm (ROLLIN) nigga cause I'm (ROLLIN)

My VIPs' trump tight, I see his ace of spades

5% tint, behind these all black shades

A young nigga paid, number nine J's

If you love yo city like me rep where you stay

(GUNPLAY VERSE 1)
My campaigns in champagne can't slow down my fast lane

I do my damn thing I'm drunk on that kerosene

Got birds I'm the pear man, pussy by the cabin

It's fake? I ain't wearing that. My cake? White as Mayonnaise

My chopsticks are foldout, the drum hoes' a hold out

Just buss me a lick I had to bond my "lil'woe" out

Tore down that pussy (yep), left the walls wore out

A Dade County nigga twist the fro, and let it grow out

I pop bands and count that, can't turn down my loud pack

You keep it real in the field? Homeboy I doubt that

Think you finna bring it here? think twice we bout that

You ride with me? Shout that. Besides you ain't bout that

(WAKA FLOCKA)

I'm drinking ace of spades like a pop soda

Man I'm balling out rapping ima stock holder

Cleiko love me like Brooklyn love HOVA. Forest Green rover. Call it Tarzan

Hell yea I'm sleep walking boy get off them Zan's

100 grand in my pockets watch me do the money dance

I'm finna change my name to Benjamin Flocka

Lord forgive me for my sins, I just killed the beat

Ostrich on the seats, Pineapple paint, bottles on me. What you want to drink?

Pills on me. Who want the heat? Steal two, I'ma Fucking G (ROLLIN!)

(Gunplay 2)

Gun on my waist, bun in my lace. Sittin all level squatting on a santé

Suckers getting sautéed, for getting all brave

Buyer and supplier, it take's 2 to rob base

Cause the tape on the town, the money on the carpet

Fish scale looking like I peel't it off a topping

From white sea to water, that shit get to talking

One question in that room? That killer get tot talking

These hoes like a ball man these hoes just for tossing

These chains, these rings, these things, I'm flossin

8's, spinning. Banana's peeling. Mouth full, I need a millii. (ROLLIN!)
