Half a brick of yay for it
I got sacks like fifth avenue

Got these niggas on a waiting list

[ Gunplay ]
I take a brick
And bust it down
Cussing loud (Son of a bitch mother fucker)
Because i spilled
A mother fucking ounce
Thats nine hundred
Of my money
God damn it
That ain't shit you find funny
I'm trying get it out here
Ain't a dime out here
I'm trying get compensated
For all my time out here
All my grind out here
I'm on my grind out here
On wax i buff it
I'm trying to shine out here
Nigga fix your face
What you never seen a brick
Up in a place you
Want to sniff it
Get a taste
Throw a bump like lace
Right away in my condo hide away
When i say powder that means
Patr and yay

[ hook ]

[ Whole Slab ]
Slanging mollys to these strippers

Smoking cone with these ?
While i'm riding around

Bust it down

When them sticks start ripping
Niggas ducking down
Rose gold rolie embezzled
