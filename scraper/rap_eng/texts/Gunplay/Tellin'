[Chorus]
Heard that nigga signed the dotted line (I heard)
Sold his soul just to stunt on time (I heard)
Told them people what they want to know (I heard)
Told them ’bout the murders and the dough (I heard)
I Heard that nigga signed the dotted line (I heard)
Sold his soul just to stunt on time (I heard)
Told them people what they want to know (I heard)
He laying low (I heard)

[Verse 1]
These niggas out here signing black and white
And coming back thinking it's alright
Everybody give them niggas daps and hugs
But ask em how you gave crackers back that dough
But with me, I couldn't let that side
Toss the racket when it's rectified
Could of pick him at a time leave him vest inside
[?] sprayed him like a pesticide
You cooperated, sign and dated
There is a hundred other ways you could have played it
Now you tarnish, lying about 100
Took that stand and pointed
"Yeah, that's him, your honor"

[Chorus]
Heard that nigga signed the dotted line (I heard)
Sold his soul just to stunt on time (I heard)
Told them people what they want to know (I heard)
Told them ’bout the murders and the dough (I heard)
I Heard that nigga signed the dotted line (I heard)
Sold his soul just to stunt on time (I heard)
Told them people what they want to know (I heard)
He laying low (I heard)

[Verse 2]
If I wasn't out here on my shit
Would you even really fuck with me?
How could you say that you ride or die
But you wouldn't even pull that stunt with me?
I keep a gun with me
Tell them crackers to come for me
I never said a word, I sat and did them calendars
I took them to the [?]
Mom pressing hard as help
Pussy niggas took the stand
And I thought I would die in jail
Them niggas point me out
I just had to shake my head
Plus my nigga wrote a statement
Couldn't believe what I read
Wouldn't believe what I said
It don't matter what he said

[Chorus]
Heard that nigga signed the dotted line (I heard)
Sold his soul just to stunt on time (I heard)
Told them people what they want to know (I heard)
Told them ’bout the murders and the dough (I heard)
I Heard that nigga signed the dotted line (I heard)
Sold his soul just to stunt on time (I heard)
Told them people what they want to know (I heard)
He laying low (I heard)

[Verse 3]
He was in love with the streets
Putting work in the game
Started buy more chains
Got caught up in the fame
He lost sight of the goal
He stayed fucking with shone
And he known for talking reckless
He got fucked up on the phone
And now the feds on the block
A couple niggas got popped
And word got back on the streets
That he got was the one set the drop
Hey man, this nigga the opp
Matter of fact this nigga the cops
I know some niggas in prison [?]
Hey man, these niggas be squealing
I got them [?] myself
And I don't fuck with co-D's, I go get it myself
Just know I got it with me from sun up to sun down
Got niggas who fucking with me, gonna pull up and run down

[Chorus]
Heard that nigga signed the dotted line (I heard)
Sold his soul just to stunt on time (I heard)
Told them people what they want to know (I heard)
Told them ’bout the murders and the dough (I heard)
I Heard that nigga signed the dotted line (I heard)
Sold his soul just to stunt on time (I heard)
Told them people what they want to know (I heard)
He laying low (I heard)
