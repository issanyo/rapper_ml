[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
We them niggas at the park, we just wanna ball
Selling dope, then we get a car and don't know what its called
Niggas foul, but the referees don't get involved
It's the finals, and my dogs came to take it all
With the heron, nigga I'm Lebron (Huh)
Quarter millie for my car, and that's on the Quran
You running with me, nigga, or you better run
Two times for you pussies 'cause you know who number one
These bitches all on my dick, is it all of my cars?
They say my Audemar sick, just bought a healthy Chopard
This a ten million flip, so nigga, fuck what you talk
100 million off the rip, the definition of boss
She can tell how I'm balling, that I'm just getting started
Yeah, I took an advance, put 20 keys in the projects
Had to scoop my lieutenant, had to make my deposits
Niggas die every time that choppa come out the closet
And I pride myself, I'm getting money in the streets
I ride myself, I'm the one you gotta see
I bring it straight to your door, do you like it, Manolo?
When you flashing that money, them people flashing your photo
Know I'm fucking these broads, 'cause I'm flashy as fuck
Five live-in maids, my crib nasty as fuck
Fi-Five live-in maids, my crib nasty as fuck
Fi-Fi-Five live-in maids, my crib nasty as fuck
Ugh

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
My money on a another level (Huh)
My money on a another level (Huh)
She fucking ordinary niggas (Woo)
Your bitch be fucking ordinary niggas

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Hating with dem bitchs, that's a flagrant foul
I'm posted with that china white, the smokers say it's Yao
A nigga play, I want his head, I'm talking 80 thou'
I tell my shooters go and get 'em, they go make a cow
Riding in a wheels a fortune, then I made a vow
I will never let these rapper niggas take my style
My dogs karate chop them bricks, then they take a bow
Throw a banana in the AK and I make a smile, grrah bah
Blake Griffin on these niggas
Rookie of the year, this ordinary shitting on these niggas
And I heard that they be hating, I ain't tripping on these niggas
Make it rain on all them hoes and have it dripping on these niggas
Lou-Louie Vutton kicks, they my ball sneaks
30 pair Michael Jordans what they cost me
Lou-Louie Vutton kicks, the-they my ball sneaks
30-30 pair Michael Jordans what they cost me

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
My money on a another level (Huh)
My money on a another level (Huh)
She fucking ordinary niggas
Your bitch be fucking ordinary niggas

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
My track got ups, jumping until it needs a crutch
Got birds flying around, like Mr. 23 himself
You wanna eat, I got the food, nigga, come and see the chef
We ain't playing by the rules, put the toolie on the refs
Snort a foul line, nigga, been high 'bout an hour now
When I get the gooking, only 3 note is the dial now
Skunk screaming loud, tryna speak a whole sound now
My hard so hard, the cookie need a pile-drive
I'm triple A; arrogant ass attitude
I live down south, right on the last avenue
This the dead end, gotta kill to fit in
Told Papi I can move it, if he can bring the shit in
Lebon 501's, white tee, hood rich
I got cheerleaders too, and everyone a hood bitch
And a whip the color the yayo, and that mothafucka foreign
Whi-whi-whip the color yayo, and that mothafucka foreign

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
My money on a another level (Huh)
My money on a another level (Huh)
She fucking ordinary niggas
Your bitch be fucking ordinary niggas
My money on a another level (Huh)
My money on a another level (Huh)
She fucking ordinary niggas
Your bitch be fucking ordinary niggas

[Outro: Rick Ross]
We gon call this the finals
Cause I can have your ass finalized (HUH)
We 25 million up nigga, Double MG the untouchable
Fuck boy, Fuck boy, Fuck boy, still a fuck boy
We gettin' money nigga
We gettin' money nigga
I see you runnin' nigga
I see you runnin' nigga
They don't want it nigga
They don't want it nigga
They don't want it nigga
They don't want it nigga
We 1 hundred nigga
We 1 hundred nigga
100 million
