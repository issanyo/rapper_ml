[Hook]
You ain't the only one gettin' money nigga
You ain't the only one gettin' money
You ain't the only one gettin' money nigga
You ain't the only one

[Verse 1]
You ain't the only one gettin' money
You ain't the only one fuckin' hoes
You ain't the only one with a gold rollie
I had that shit when I wasn't known, nigga what?
You ain't the only one with a Benz nigga
You ain't the only one ridin' foreign
You ain't the only one duckin' fans nigga
You ain't the only one with a warrant
Talkin' 'bout you gettin money, nigga me too
Talkin' 'bout you worth a hundred-million, me too
Talkin' 'bout you caught a body, nigga me too
Talkin' 'bout you 'bout it, 'bout it, me too
Nigga what the fuck you think?
This the Maybach bank (Maybach Music)
Anybody got a problem my revolver gon' solve it
Big wallet, I could pay to leave a nigga slain

[Hook]
You ain't the only one gettin' money nigga
You ain't the only one gettin' money
You ain't the only one gettin' money nigga
You ain't the only one

[Verse 2]
You ain't the only one screamin' Thug Life
You ain't the only dope dealer in the hood
You ain't the only one fuckin' that bitch
You ain't the only one, anybody could
Nigga what's happenin', you ain't the only one with a Canon
You ain't the only one goddammit
We all about slidin', we all about ridin'
We all about peelin' wigs back with bananas
You all about this and you all about that
What you all about, tell 'em when your ass get jammed
You ain't the only one with an AK
With a 4'5, with a tre-8, and that's no lie

[Hook 2]
You ain't the only one gettin' money nigga
You ain't the only one gettin' money
You ain't the only one gettin' money nigga
You ain't the only one
You ain't the only one (gettin' money, fucking hoes)
You ain't the only one (gettin' money, fucking hoes)
You ain't the only one (gettin' money, fucking hoes)
You ain't the only one (gettin' money, fucking hoes)

[Verse 3]
Gettin' money, fucking hoes
I ain't the only one but I damn sure does
You was gettin' money back in the day and you damn sure was
But you ratted, now you're lookin' like you're workin' for the fuzz
You ain't the only one puttin' pussy on your tongue
You ain't the only one puttin' dick up in her lung
You ain't the only one that be trickin' in the club
Me too, guilty, yeah but I'm filthy
You ain't the only one with a bankroll
You ain't the only one slangin' white dope
You ain't the only one with a car and garage
In a neighbourhood of white folks

[Hook 2]
You ain't the only one gettin' money nigga
You ain't the only one gettin' money
You ain't the only one gettin' money nigga
You ain't the only one
You ain't the only one (gettin' money, fucking hoes)
You ain't the only one (gettin' money, fucking hoes)
You ain't the only one (gettin' money, fucking hoes)
You ain't the only one (gettin' money, fucking hoes)

[Outro]
You ain't the only one gettin' money nigga
You ain't the only one gettin' money
You ain't the only one, you ain't the only one gettin' money
