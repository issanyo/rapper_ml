They not knowin' (they not) X3
They finna learn shit the hard way

They don't know nothin' (they don't) X3
They finna learn shit the hard way

[Verse 1]
Big chain my neck hurt Big watch my wrist hurt
Hoes going beserk a walking blizzard
Beef is just dessert my work never scissored
My shit be white whiter than a grand wizard
My position went from petty to big fete already
Rapin' that white lady golden girl white betty
Ain't steppin' on that ho don't wanna get that white dirty
G-A-N-G-S-T-A and thats for certain
I got me a conan? 2 G's for 2000 throwbacks
Got money power fame now where the hoes at?
She tryna ride but she askin' where the does at?
I see ya tryna get money this is where the most at
Get high compulsive can't keep my composure
Tattoos on my osa heart blacker than vulture?
I just wanna fuck thats what my hoes for
I am a shock to the whole human culture
I run the asphalt here come the bath-salt
Cut the B.S. with a gindogen hacksaw
2LM jack boy fuck all that rap talk
I leave yo whip with one wheel like a catwalk
Nigga? what my name is thats why I came here
And I came with a heron hurricane here
Short stop no prob won't ask if I could slang here
We toastin' votes in ima do my thang here
This kid from skid row dirty hat brim low
Lookin' like criminal chief like seminal
If they don't let them know I brung extra extendos
My charges used to let the public defend those
Comprendo compadre middle finger in ya madre
While I pull a benz up to the guard gate
Broad day off safety in ya hallway
I guess they gotta learn shit the hard way
