[Intro]
Rep your city, rep your city, if you love it like I love my city, if you love it

[Hook]
I love my city, yup I love my city
I know we do wrong but I love my city
Yup I love my city, yup I love my city
I know we catch bodies but I love my city

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E]
Let's talk about Harlem, Brooklyn, BX, Queens
Five boroughs, so thorough, sad how they make cream
Hip-hop was my break, empire my state
Rest in peace to them towers, them cowards gon pay
More money, more murders, our truth, your journey
Little niggas that pull triggers, one hit, four burners
In that big apple, Frank Sinatra
I'm talking Big Pun, Big L, Big Poppa
Times square when that ball dropping
Good belt crew, I got em all shopping
Fuck you thought, I smoke Newports
I'm a true boss, and rep New York

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
If I ever broke, Joke
If if was a fifth I'd be outside the liquor store
I am raw, as the sushi roll, trapping up by the studio
And everybody know that I'm dead fresh, funeral
I Back out in my glass house
I walk in with that chooper and they ran out
I take your girl to my man's spot
No games but I'm playing with my X-Box

[Hook]

[Verse 3: City Boy Dee]
I love my city, where I'm from it go down a lot
Common wealth, niggas catching twenty-four forty rock
I'm scorching hot around here, niggas like to talk a lot
Screaming all that king shit, but niggas ain't did shit
Boston, known for sports
And on them side street they selling drugs all sorts, moving balls off courts
They ain't taking no sharks, still kind of tight
We lost place to New York, You hear Boston when I talk

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Bun B]
I rep my city, Port Author
That's right, it's right off the water
That's right, we right where we ought to be
Baby serving your water, order
Put in work on the regular, catch me working incellular
Got that books like an editor, rock with me, why, better bruh
Not time for competitors, get haters away from me
If these haters come play with me, than pray for them haters G
They ain't G and they know it, know I'm ready to throw it
Love my city like you love your city then go ahead and show it, put it up

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mack Maine]
All you unpleasant peasants
Bow in the presence of a legend
My presence is a present and a blessing
It´s the dirt south boy from the cresin
Got a message for rats that be snitching and confessing
Make my name taste like ass when you speak it, tongue full of shit stains
This the r and g no 3 yeah rich gang
'Voodoo queens,bu coup fiens'
We say New Orleans y´all say New Orleans

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Gunplay]
I put down for the yay/yo, Carol City highly
NNB, Hope a lot in 21 Jump Street
Whole the town more choppers than an a r my (pronounced mi)
War zone where AKs and ARs be
Just a trao nigga Sam tray green candy paint pickel
Wide body broms shouldve made the lanes bigger
Niggas on the run eating cover page don diva
Down here niggas dying for bitches or a time keeper

[Hook]
