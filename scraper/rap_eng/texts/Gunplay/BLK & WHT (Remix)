[Hook: Rick Ross] (x2)
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Tear gas all through the night
Niggas thuggin' out in Ferguson so get it right

[Verse 1: Stalley]
The streets ruthless, the coupe roofless, the nine is near
The new niggas get fools, man, this time of year
My palms itchin', the money clickin', my time is here
Whatever you lookin' for, I'm sure you can find it here
I rose from the ashes, sleepin' on pissy mattress
Niggas was cuttin' classes, ridin' Cutlass Classics
The streets we mastered, in BAs and AKs
Ain't make it to the NBA but we ball like everyday, aye
Word to Trayvon and Mike Brown
Them pigs'll gun you down and call it standin' they ground
The situation wack, we need a moment of silence
Or violence, I'm only being honest
Don't condone it but fuck it, we ridin'
Ain't goin' down without a fight
Middle finger up if they ever try and read me my rights
Hangin' out the window screaming "F the police"
Damn right, a nigga black but he sellin' white

[Hook 2: Rick Ross] (x2)
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Young nigga sitting in the Benz and it's white on white

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I can remember my daddy and even daddy's pappy
Hidin' bricks of the shit up in my granny's attic
My uncle stole out the package and daddy beat him savage
And though he beat him, I could tell it was love in the lashes
He looked me deep in my eyes, past the tears and the lashes
Told me, "Son, never become a victim of habits"
Like Michael did to Fredo, pops shoulda had a captain
But showed too much compassion and unc' end up rattin' and
Just reminiscin' as I package and deliver product
Great men diminish cause snitches often fuckin' the plot up
Put dollars on my daddy books, unc', fuck him for life
Third generation black businessman, my product white

[Hook 3]
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Young nigga sitting in the Phantom and it's white on white

[Hook 2]

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
Coming from nothin', I had to hustle up somethin'
I had to get me some paper, I had to pull me a caper
I tucked the Glock in my khakis, I told the bitch I'll be back
She told me "Daddy, be careful, you know all these niggas is rats"
Ain't no fear in my heart, and ain't no lies in my tongue
Won't die broke, I put that on the breath in my lung
All of my clips extended, nothin' I live's pretended
They threw a case in my face, but I was safe and defended
As I stomp on the street, on the road less traveled
As I look up to God as he look down on the gravel
I ask for protection, from hammers and gavels
And blasphemous devils, somebody, pass 'em this message

[Hook 4]
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Sitting in the Phantom and it's white on white

[Hook 2]

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Wanna gun me to the ground like Michael Brown
Settled in the projects, now you knock it down
Now my niggas wanna ride till we all expired
Smoked a ounce for my dog on the day he died
Sprayed yo' name on the walls in the project hall
Died for his red rag so it's for the cause
Bullet holes rip the seams in them denim jeans
The Lorraine Motel was a guillotine
Revolution's televised, operation pushed
Held a burden and a prize under George Bush
Burt back home, nigga did a quarter
Rigor mortis is the only thing that prison taught him
Flippin' quarters

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Hmm, ooh-ooh, ooh
Well, well, well
Hmmmmmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
