You don't know where it is, but you know how to [?]
If you know what it is, you'd know that I ball
You know that I bounce, [?] all in the house
A minute and I'm out, a minute and I'm out
I'm on the highway ridin' like a boss
Goin' lip tight down, bitch, it's time for me to floss
Million dollar nigga grindin' like I'm still broke
Up and [?]
[?] in the Motel 6, let them boys know that the [?] gettin' rich
I see the new Benz, I see the new boat
I'd rather see your fuckin' limos, I could see you goin' broke
Not me, bitch, 'cause I'm still with the [?]
Me and dollar bills [?]

Now let me homie know, let him know I'm back in town
Said them people hit the house, fuck it, we ain't backin' down
Stayin' [?] with the skinny ridin' Shawty
And the blockers blockin' haters, can't see 'em through my Pradas

Don't tell him I'm itchy, stop movin', no flinchin'
