I think I'm a living legend (x4)

[Verse]
I be riding through my city like a living legend
I was still getting money, middle of recession
These pussys bussin' like pipes when I bring that pressure
I be riding 3 deep me, Smith N Wesson
I'm bout that action, bout that action, bitch I'm bout that action
Was a bully in the cage until I bust the latches
I hit the streets like a spark on a hunnid matches
Used to go to sleep, piss off on my shitty mattress
Ain't nothing like a trap, and a "not guilty" verdict
Same feeling when you leave a bitch pussy murdered
I don't give a fuck, never have and I never will
I scratch a candy paint and yank both set of rims
They wasn't forgis, almost threw em in the trash
Then I called you up and sold it, right back to yo pussy ass
You know my pedigree, I'm everything I said I'd be
AK 4-7, clip shaped letter C
