[Intro: Lito]
Shootaz!
Uh-huh
Shootaz!
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
He got shot by a shooter with a Ruger, Hallelujah
Now his snitching ass dead
Can't tell on nobody no more
Can't tell them crackers who selling what and who getting bread
And I ain't mad 'bout that neither, it ain't wrong if you did it for the right reason
Cause he out here in the street, telling all them people' bout your dirt
Got swept with the street sweeper
Real niggas I ride with, pussy niggas don't [?]
Heard a nigga got fish scale, shit yeah, I'm a pirate
Down for a 2-11 robbery, lay it down
Don't say a sound, quiet like a library
One word, get wet like a hydrant
Think I'm playing? Let a nigga try me
Dej Loaf couldn't tell you better than I can

[Hook: Lito]
I be sliding
I be sliding with that thang all day
Anything moving getting knocked off
Hundred niggas deep, we let them chops off
I be sliding
I be sliding with that thang all day
Anything moving getting knocked off
Hundred niggas deep, we let them chops off

[Verse 2: Lito]
Bending the corner them doubling back
See, them boys that you with done exposed where you at
You die with your dawg if you go with a rat
We don't play that, my niggas bring it where you stay at
We got them choppas with the coolers
Big Glock .40, clip longer than a ruler
Got your momma at church screaming "Lord, Hallelujah!"
Shoot-shoot-shooters, boy that's all a nigga know
Anything moving in the 'hood gotta go cause I need it
I done shed tears and bleeded
Mind on go with a clique full of demons, oh! I will never let it go, take a nigga soul right here off the cement, oh!
Make the piece off the[?], put them through shit but they never believed it

[Hook: Lito]
I be sliding
I be sliding with that thang all day
Anything moving getting knocked off
Hundred niggas deep, we let them chops off
I be sliding
I be sliding with that thang all day
Anything moving getting knocked off
Hundred niggas deep, we let them chops off

[Verse 3: Cuzin Ryan]
Bro made it easy, he said "All you need is rap"
Left the guns and drugs alone so he could run and trap
Stay-stayed around shooters so why I be strapped
Don't ask [?] gon' clap
And he coming off a M, that's a proven fact
And he got aim, don't be the proof in that
It's always a tough guy to end up getting whacked
David and Goliath with a different kind of strap
I'm killing the game with a different kind of rap
Dropped "From the Mar" to put the city on the map
Say I'm the best just to see who gon' react (Nobody saying shit)
Been, been, been a couple days, shit I ain't hear a sound
Young Breed tweeting, say I'm holding down the town
Perfecting my craft, I feel I finally found
Music from the Mar, you gon' love this sound

[Hook: Lito]
I be sliding
I be sliding with that thang all day
Anything moving getting knocked off
Hundred niggas deep, we let them chops off
I be sliding
I be sliding with that thang all day
Anything moving getting knocked off
Hundred niggas deep, we let them chops off
