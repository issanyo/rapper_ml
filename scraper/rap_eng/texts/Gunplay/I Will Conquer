[Verse 1: Masspike Miles]
It's gon' stay dark, til a nigga lose, and the sun won't shine
I done seen niggas lose they life out here, how I'm livin' mine
This feelin', you couldn't know, places I've been, you wouldn't go
Goin' through the world, tired enough to keep me out
Only made a nigga harder, who can stop me now?

[Pre-Hook: Masspike Miles]
So whatcha gonna do to me? This ain't nuttin' new to me
There's no nigga more solid, ain't nuttin' more than me

[Hook: Masspike Miles]
In love with this feelin' that's bigger than life
You can do nuttin' to hurt me, they tried
I will conquer all
I will conquer all

[Verse 2: Masspike Miles]
Made a nigga off terrain, watch the weather change in a minute
I could read a nigga brain, niggas playin' games, I ain't wit it
Look in my eyes, what do you see? Pain in my soul, the heart of a G
If it's on me, I'mma keep it G, I don't really know no limit
Been around the world, to another world, only God is my witness

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
Take a look at me, take a look at she
Took it to the top, took you from the street
Never had a dime, only had a dream
Only had a name
Niggas call they folks, try to send me up the road
Now I'm on the run
Me and my bitch deal, swisha, bind, money and a gun
Made thru the fire, made it thru the trial, made it thru the dark
Made it to the light, niggas never been thru pain
Painful is mine
Rat niggas on this beach, all I hear is phoney on it
Youz a pussy nigga, I can tell, I can bet my Rollie on it

[Hook]
