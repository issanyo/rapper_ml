[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Shit ain’t gravy, shit ain’t wavy
Not even close, to copacetic maybe
Dade County dog, little runt with the rabies
Call D-C-F, we drowning these babies
Cuba, Haiti, Voodoo, ladies
Diamonds, rubies, you be, hating
Feel my talents, now you see how my style is
Brutal, malice, the foulest
Gunplay, real name ratchet Moralis
A nigga trigger-finger catching a callus
I go [*snarl/growl*] to all the cats in the alley
Stepping on these rats in my Baileys
With bats in the Caddy
He already not looking shabby; go for the gold
Retriever, labby, torch, G to K, B-X, ain't it?
Triple C, leave your G-S, painted

[Hook: Gunplay]
Bogota, Medellin, both on the way here
And when they drop, you know they gon' stay here
Machines, machetes, Maybach, mayhem
Excuse me motherfucker, ehem!

[Verse 2: Vado]
Ball all day, never sit on the benches
Bitches want attention and niggas wanna be mentioned
Two-four-five is what a nigga benching
Ain’t a scope, hit his henchman
Grab a rope, get the lynchin'
I’m handin' rappers suspensions
School of hard knocks, I come from a hard block
We’re pumping them hard rocks
I’m in the drop, one button away from a hard top
I’m playing the park lot, away when the narcs watch
Sitting on wild 'ye, foul play, is why I stay on my toes like ballet
No cars, but hand more keys than valet
Get robbed, they hand me the keys the way you down stay
If I play the bar, the Cris pours
Kick saw, deal in the cars with slick talk
Sick boy, I go hard, I spit raw
Far as broads, I threw more lobs than Chris Paul

[Hook: Gunplay]
Bogota, Medellin, both on the way here
And when they drop, you know they gon' stay here
Machines, machetes, Maybach, mayhem
Excuse me motherfucker, ehem!

[Verse 3: Uncle Murda]
Trust who? I don’t know who to trust
I got my hammer out, I don’t know who to bust
My V-V-S diamonds got them hating on me
Stick up kids outside the club, they waiting on me
I hit them up, now they waiting on the paramedics
Them niggas needed to get shot, like a diabetic
Puerto Rican girls, in my hotel room
I let my man fuck 'em, he going to jail soon
He got a threesome before he did his one-to-three
I almost walked in the court room with my gun on me
A nigga stay strapped, almost forgot I had it
A nigga still banging, almost forgot I'm rapping
Shut the club down, poured a hundred bottles
I was murder team, I’m uncle Luciano
You know, big talk, boss shit
When I do it, I do it big, horseshit

[Hook: Gunplay]
Bogota, Medellin, both on the way here
And when they drop, you know they gon' stay here
Machines, machetes, Maybach, mayhem
Excuse me motherfucker, ehem!

[Verse 4: Sauce Money]
All I need is one square to function
And a connect that will meet me at the junction
Niggas talking reckless for nothing
But as long as it’s behind my back
I’m cool with niggas fronting
Cops on the street is like watching T-V
Lay back in the cut and watch 'em, easy
They say real G’s move in silence
So in order to get it, I just had to be me
Any plug comes with P-C
Me first, me second, me three
They say you ain’t a money nigga
Till your whip is a year ahead and your chick is out in D-C
But my Philly thing is imperial
That thing out in Virginia's wife material
My California love is so serial
My Indianapolis thing is so motor vehicle

[Hook: Gunplay]
Bogota, Medellin, both on the way here
And when they drop, you know they gon' stay here
Machines, machetes, Maybach, mayhem
Excuse me motherfucker, ehem!
