[Verse 1: Gunplay]
She know what a felon is
I fell in love with her vanilla-ness
And the way she keep me on my toes
Up for days together, heaven knows
Nothing came between the bond
She had flaws, I adored every single one
She was heartless, such a cold bitch
A big flirt, flirtin' with a whole clique
She the queen in Miami, where money is a major issue
Her sister was re(?) tell her rest in peace too
Search for the place where I find her embrace
Usually in the trap with my niggas on the chase
I fuck with her, tough, you can see it in my face
See it in my swag you can tell I had a taste
But I love her though
But she don't get along with my mother though

Baby you’re my next in line, for your vanilla texture

So lay back and relax, while I let my hands explore
Oh yeah, you like it like that, baby tell me do you want more?

[Verse 3]
Ain’t no need for talking, sit back and let my fingers do the walking
Proceed your body with precaution, soft, tender loving giving often
As your tender love begins to soften, oh girl you blow my mind
Vanilla texture girl got me high
