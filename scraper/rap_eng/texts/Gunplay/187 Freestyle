Free my nigga Kano
Tonight's the night I get in some shit
Bart simpson shit, I wanna see that
Crimson shit
Down city clippers, clip some shit
Miami flippers, flip some shit
Wet your car get neck dumar
Don't beg the arts, the arms in my palm
'Bout the length of arms
Strength in numbers as long as I'm number 1
On me don't slumber none
Nothing but guns, yea nothing but sons
Nothing but cunts, nothing but lunch
Stick in the towel shit that will stick it to the tip of the tower
Dick sucking bitch don't put your lips on the bottle
She had the hard knock life cause she trick in the body
Got whooped a couple of times
She ain't tripping nobody
Er'time I hit she say my dick is atomic
What up, you know I'm a cut up
It's no thing, came for one got fronted a hundred more things
Take one shot no honey cocaine, give me money no fame
You need new shoes, how you running game
They cut a nigga lose, cause I ain't wanna tame
Fuck nigga call for, now I'm a wanted man
Tryin' to make a milly I'm a hundred dollar now
How the hell I get deal, incredible
You don't hear? you finna feel
This trigga' here nigga yeah
I'm climbing up a sugar hill look at here
Bogota, Medellin 7 gears
You playin' with me
You know the rest
You playin' with me
You know the rest
You playin' with me
You know the rest
You playin' with me
You know the rest
