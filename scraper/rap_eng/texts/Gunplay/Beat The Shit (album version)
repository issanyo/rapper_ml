[Hook]
Fuck wit me wrong, take me out my zone
And I'll knock the mothafuckin' snow off ya cone, mah nigga
Man, it stink in this bitch
It must be them pussy-ass niggas talkin' shit
So beat the shit out of that pussy-ass nigga
Beat the shit out of that pussy-ass nigga
Bitch-ass, hoe-ass, pussy ass-nigga
I beat the shit out of that pussy-ass nigga
We beat the shit out of that pussy-ass nigga
We shit out that pussy-ass nigga
Beat the shit out of that pussy ass-nigga

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
I'm a knuckle-throwin' knucklehead
What that muthafucka said?
Bring that rockets up in here
Throwin' bottles, chuckin' chairs
Got the pretty models duckin', breakin' heels and
Chippin' nails
Turn around and go right back to breakin' down
My cigarillo
Countin' up with Suga Hill, slidin' up in somethin'
New
Spillin gin and jungle juice, and I got that lumber too
And I brought the fuckin' zoo, tear this shit up
And chuck a deuce
This triple C, they Triple L, lames love to
Lose
A hundred million in my horoscope, 'bout to
Show you a horror show
Boot you fuckin' head off your collar bone
Them niggas flinchin' at the sight of arms
Pussy niggas ain't eatin', but we fry the farm
Beat a nigga down 'til he left without a vital sign

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wanye]
I run off in yo' fuckin' shit, damn, now I got shit stains
All these fuckin' tattoos, and I ain't got one bitch name
Got a pocket full of ass-whoopins, I'm givin' 'em out like nicknames
What's up with yo' fist game?
You'll catch a hook - fish hang
Watch me cock the Nina, call that rough sex
Knock yo' head off, you just a rough neck
And if I'm shootin' at ya, nigga, all net
Ain't not world peace, just Ron Artest
Dick in the booty ass nigga
Die quick in a movie ass, nigga
Extra-fruit-in-the-smoothie ass nigga
Get beat like a drum, music class, nigga
Life is a gamble, dyin' is yo' best bet
Got a scope on the pistol, give yo' ass fresh breath
Give mah fist a kiss, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil' Wanye]
What's really good, nigga? I'm feelin' good, nigga
Rest in peace lil' Wesley Wes
A pussy-ass nigga always kill a good nigga
I'm high as Heaven, I'll pop the reverend and stop the wedding
Got more money than memories in the bank, don't forget it
Mah team is up, I'm high as Scotty, beam me up
They say we all gotta pay the price, fuck it, man - ring me up
Fuckin' right I skate, hoe - pussy is mah scapegoat
And all these pussy-ass niggas that's hatin', kiss mah ass, besos
I'm a genius, take notes - I'll split yo' egg to the egg yolk
I'll be dead before I be dead broke
Still burn money, my bread toast
Fuck it, if you got it, spend it, nigga
But just keep your two pennies, nigga
Start shit and I'll end it, nigga
Don't open yo' mouth, I'm a dentist, nigga
Lil' Tunechi... give mah fist a kiss, nigga...

[Outro]
So beat the shit out of that pussy-ass nigga
Beat the shit out of that pussy-ass nigga
Bitch-ass, hoe-ass, pussy ass-nigga
I beat the shit out of that pussy-ass nigga
We beat the shit out of that pussy-ass nigga
We shit out that pussy-ass nigga
Beat the shit out of that pussy ass-nigga
Fuck with me wrong, take me out my zone
I'll bring it to your chest, make you king me like
Kong, my nigga
What you drink in this bitch?
I'll give you a whole bottle of it to your face
Nigga
