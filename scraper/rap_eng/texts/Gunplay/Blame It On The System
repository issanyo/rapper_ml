[Hook x4: Turk]
Blame it on the system, we can't win and we losing
Black a killer, black man, kill a white man, they’re losing him

[Verse 1: Turk]
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
They put a nigga head behind bars and throw the key away
They find you guilty for the charge before you plead the case
Yeah, you’re guilty 'til proven innocent, them bitches snakes
Real talk, dog, know it ain’t fake
You gotta stay strong, homie don’t break
Stay silent nigga, and don’t turn state
I keep it gangsta like a G that’s the only way
I’mma take my lick, no I never been a snitch
I done did time twice, and I'd do this shit again
They say why do ten when you can tell on a friend
Then put you out there so a nigga cut through your head
It’s a dirty world but it still spin
You can’t do nothing about but try to live in it
We’ve been losing don't doubt it, them people still winning
It strikes you out like a diamond, night ended

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Fuck the state jury judge and the victim
All they love to see is me convicted, but I’m mafia connected
He rattin, assault with this rifle is suggested
I’m already won every battle tested
This your warning I won't send another message
The system can’t calm me and the feds can’t catch us!
These hoes can’t break me and these haters can’t stress us
Folks can’t pin any murder to these weapons
They’re tryina give me life, they ain’t tryna give me justice
Bang bang with the gavel, no discussions
We running from the fusses, they’re jumping on who does it
Niggas right back on the block like they wasn't
Could never stop the hustle or the bullet out this muzzle
Pistol grip pump knocking pieces out your puzzle
Pointed at the trial, you must wanna die
You gonna get the business once you stop one foot outside

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Turk]
I caught a charge and the judge try to suck to me
Trying to get me thirty years for the steal, but he couldn’t
He gave me the max, and they send me to max
Twenty three in one what you know about that
It’s hard when you’re black, you don’t stand a chance
Sentence you to death if you kill a white man
In inside man, we’re never right, man
Go to trial, hit your life, shootin dice man
To the police we’re a perfect target
Their main goal is trying to take us out the fucking market
Make you a convict, now you’re starving
Can’t get a job picking cotton cause of your charges
Ain’t nothing changed cause Barack
You’re out your damn frame if you think corruption stop
It still the same man this shit ain't ever stop
You can blame it on the system, don’t blame it on hip hop!

[Hook]
