I tried to tell em

[Hook: Novaking]
I tried to tell em
Oh yea, I tried to tell em
Ooh me oh my I tried to tell em
Oh yea, I tried to tell em
(Tried to tell these motherfuckers I’m the one man)
Yea yea, you see me getting to the money like I’m supposed to
Sliding through the city in my old school
I Tried to tell em
Ooh me oh my I tried to tell em
Oh yea I tried to tell em

[Verse 1: Epidemic]
Pull up in the phantom, no it wasn’t tinted
No congratulations, they just asked me if it’s rented
Matter fact it is it cost me $1200 a day
And I’ve had it for a month, did I just fuck up your day
By the way - I was broke for 90% of my life
They was cutting off my lights
I almost cut my wrists twice
No need for the police for what?
We was from the streets
I tried to ask jesus for peace
Instead I got a jesus piece
I never was the one fam
Never a front man
But now these niggas filming, only right I gotta stunt man
Walk into the building to the side you tryna to front man
Jealous of my sun tan
Fuck man

[Hook: Novaking]
I tried to tell em
Oh yea, I tried to tell em
Ooh me oh my I tried to tell em
Oh yea, I tried to tell em
(Tried to tell these motherfuckers I’m the one man)
Yea yea, you see me getting to the money like I’m supposed to
Sliding through the city in my old school
I Tried to tell em

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
I tried to tell em
I tried to warn em
Told em I’m a slap you with my iron
I’m bout my money
He ain’t listen
Thought I was bs’ing - huh
Then I made the news cuz the robbery got messy
Now he know I’m bout that shit but now it’s too late
I had to turn the city into Baghdad and Kuwait
I tried to tell em man
I’m a walking felony
I done been to hell and back
And ain’t scared to go to jail again
Ain’t nothing bout me flawed
And you can bet that
Bet I whip a whip right off the lot and probably wreck that
Bet I drop the work into the pot and whip a wet sack
Bet I hit the block up with this rock and then collect racks

[Hook: Novaking]
I tried to tell em
Oh yea, I tried to tell em
Ooh me oh my I tried to tell em
Oh yea, I tried to tell em
(Tried to tell these motherfuckers I’m the one man)
Yea yea, you see me getting to the money like I’m supposed to
Sliding through the city in my old school

[Verse 3: Zoey Dollaz]
I tried to tell em
But they ain’t believe me
I dropped on they ass and I ran through a check
I made it look easy
But they ain’t see all of the grind
They ain’t see all of the time
Somedays I wake up so hungry I couldn’t even drop a rhyme, uh
Now i’m jumping on them flights for the shows
Nickname me bomb cuz I’m bout to blow
Look at the look on they faces
Like I never told them I was gon make it
You niggas is too busy hating
I was on my grind, like I was skating
Now I’m jumping out of foreigns
I remember my car needed maintenance
But I tried to tell em I was getting to the money
I don’t owe nobody shit, can’t take shit from me
And I tried to tell em
But ain’t nobody listen
So if you can’t take the heat that a young nigga bringin, fuck out the kitchen

[Hook: Novaking]
