Chorus
Wake up in the Morning
And I count the paper
Tell the m other niggas
Better get there weigh up
Im in the club balling
I ain't talking lay-ups
Bitches asking why we do it so major
That's why they hate(x5)
Man fuck them haters
That's why they hate(x5)

Lyrics
Hold up
I dont need no introduction
Yall already know my name yo
All I know is trill niggas
I dont fuck with lame hoes
Smoking on the pine tree
Me and my little dime peice
B-balling in the club
I wish a nigga check my I.D
Say wit my dogs
And I ain't talking scooby
Hoes choosing
And they wanna do me
{pop the fly out yup let them out}?????????????????
Beetter get your ass carried out
Like red bones,i like dark skin
I like girls who like girls to
When my system lock
And shad the block
Two 28s in my old school
Tatted up, white t
Pockets full of cash
I am so hot I think I just found snoops stash
6 g on a run way
Magic city on a monday
From O-hi to 305
Bow wezzy and gunplay

Wake up in the Morning
And I count the paper
Tell the m other niggas
Better get there weigh up
Im in the club balling
I ain't talking lay-ups
Bitches asking why we do it so major
That's why they hate(x5)
Man fuck them haters
That's why they hate(x5)

Gunplay
Lyrics
Black magic chrome things
Fresh spray im out of here
No miles new leather
Stunting for my audience
Putting on big time
But that ain't really shit tho
You can throw it in the club
But but that ain't really rich though
Ain't that bout a bitch though
Can't buy swag like this though
A white girl on white girl
Thats what I call a disco
Im all about that big dough
Her mouth all about that get low
I gave that ho a double douse
She throwing back trying to get mo
Quit asking who my jewler and
If I know slick rick the ruler
Im gunplay don logan
Fuck it call me don shooter
Ill snap her like a barracuda
Ill beat it up
I tattooed it
I pick her up
I knock it down
Then keep that cadillac moving

Chorus
Wake up in the Morning
And I count the paper
Tell the m other niggas
Better get there weigh up
Im in the club balling
I ain't talking lay-ups
Bitches asking why we do it so major
That's why they hate(x5)
Man fuck them haters
That's why they hate(x5)

Bowwow

Chorus
Wake up in the Morning
And I count the paper

Bitches asking why we do it so major
That's why they hate(x5)
Man fuck them haters
That's why they hate(x5)
