[Intro]
It's a full time job
Keep that yappa on the shelf
I got a problem and a plan
Revolver in my hand

[Hook]
I've been boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons, boxin' with my demons
Boxin' with my demons
What you don't know won't hurt you
I've been boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons
Boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons, boxin' with my demons
Boxin' with my demons

[Verse 1]
This a full time job, 24/7 gig
To keep the yappa on the shelf and all the hollows in the clip
'Cause niggas ain't playin' like they 'posed to
They tell and comin' home to open arms and mimosas
When they all should be ghosts
Free my partners in shackles
Who let the crooks in the castle? Bunch of crooked bastards
Sticks in the classics
Boxin' with my demons, not to leave 'em in caskets
Boxin' with my demons, overheatin' my gaskets
I need some percocets, no I need some self control
Burn by myself in Hell with my selfish soul
I ain't never cared about nothin' but expensive clothes
And bustin' nuts all off in these centerfolds

[Hook]
I've been boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons, boxin' with my demons
Boxin' with my demons
What you don't know won't hurt you
I've been boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons
Boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons, boxin' with my demons
Boxin' with my demons

[Verse 2]
My soul so dark, so cold, same as my heart
You don't know how long I marched, I'm so hot and parched
Ain't nobody gave me nothin' but at ease
A mean unit on their mug screamin', "Peace"
Grew up emulatin' niggas that'll never get released
Slicin' faces for a slice and never get a piece
Made a deal with the devil for a Chevrolet Caprice
454 and MMG in the seats
I'm on the verge to pull the trigger while I curse
Green, syrup and vicodins just so I can fight the urge
Coke on my tongue, but never bitin' words
Demons screamin', fuck 'em, leave 'em hole-y like the church

[Hook]
I've been boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons, boxin' with my demons
Boxin' with my demons
What you don't know won't hurt you
I've been boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons
Boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons, boxin' with my demons
Boxin' with my demons

[Bridge]
I tried so hard
Boxin' with my demons
It's a full time job, it's a full time job
Boxin' with my demons
It's a full time job, it's a full time job

[Verse 3]
That p-pussy so pure, take you on tour
Skatin' straight to the plane, escapin' to Europe
All these demons so pretty, be tastin' sweet as some syrup
So addicted to money makin' we OD with no fear
I just heard the B-A-G is secure
That's a good thing to hear, 'cause I've been feinin' severe
Lookin' everywhere, even seen Venus from here
Like a kid in the night, man fightin' demons, I'm scared

[Hook]
I've been boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons, boxin' with my demons
Boxin' with my demons
What you don't know won't hurt you
I've been boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons
Boxin' with my demons 'til my knuckles turn purple
Boxin' with my demons, boxin' with my demons
Boxin' with my demons
