[Intro]
No arm and hammer in my Hannah Montana
No arm and hammer in my Hannah Montana

[Verse 1]
I got a clean thousand on the triple-beam bouncin'
It be jumpin' out the trap before the water out the faucet, work
Broke before I bought it, like a rap before I wrote it
Never loaded with no soda, your line gon' be round the corner
My digi gettin' busy, S550 to show
Packs on packs on packs, fresh up out the ???
Port authority I choke, already sold 'em I need mo'
Papi straighten me and go, pick that up, adios
So you know, ain't no ??? in here
All the way ?????? in here
Try stick up the spot, sticks gon' ??? you
Stand behind my product, no Pepsi in my bottle
I don't want it off top if it ain't off block

[Hook]
No arm and hammer in my Hannah Montana
No arm and hammer in my Hannah Montana
No arm and hammer in my Hannah Montana
Straight bling bling, whippin' with an antenna
No arm and hammer in my Hannah Montana
No arm and hammer in my Hannah Montana

[Verse 2]
Thousand grams of yayo, straight yayo, that mean I'm on
Now they lookin' at me, is he really ????
All black black down but my nine chrome
Ain't a motherfucker on this globe I owe
I just came to put in work and show you how to ruger jerk
I'm Jupiter Jack, welcome to my universe
I put bitches on the pole, 24, gettin' dough
Make 'em work the floor, break her fuckin' toe
White jumpin' out the box of crayons all night
Don't be tryin' nothin' funny, I need money on sight
It's only right, call me Don Logan ??? mic
No arm and hammer in my Hannah Montana for life

[Hook]
