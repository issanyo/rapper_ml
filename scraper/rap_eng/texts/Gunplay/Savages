[Hook](x2)

In the beast's abdomen sleep is hazardous
When you share air with dealers, fiends, and savages

[Verse 1: Gunplay]

Savage, Black Sabbath, my automatic now that's damage
Blam blam em for ham sandwich
Feinds, rocks, at the end of broken antennae
In my hood we ain't flaggin' with no bandannas
Only bandanna on a face behind the damn hammer
Still pull up to the corner store with a peel top
Baseheads still asking me if I still got it
Big gun with the little dot
Never saw Arkansas, but I got a Little Rock
Stones bout as clear as some deer park
I pull the oak out and slap you with the still part
Ain't nothin' poppin' if I ain't poppin'
If the work's off ain't droppin'
You got guns but they ain't choppers
You got goons but they ain't goblins

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cormega] :

Only lavishness civilizes savages
In my mind is a plan to expand and get adequate land in Africa
Till then I'm still enlightened with rappin'
My word is scripture my nerve genuine in character
Realness from dealin’ to the pen
Now I get deals cause my pen is immaculate
Health is wealth, broke niggas are sick
Rappers are liars, I’m a known street nigga that spits
On the throne with poems or with the chrome put holes in expensive clothes
[?]
I’m in a different zone presidential suites
Niggas tellin’ when there’s beef so I’m sendin’ drones
My reputation written in stone not a rapbook
It’s deep how they lives and they rhymes don’ add up
They legs weak when it’s time to stand up
Real recognize real whether triumph or failure

[Hook]
