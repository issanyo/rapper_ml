[Hook]
Bogota talk, Bogota walk
It's a Bogota blizzard on my Bogota block
Bogota white rims with a Bogota bitch
White Bogota diamonds, I'm Bogota rich
B-O-G-O-T-A (x8)

[Verse 1]
This Bogota I'm slinging blinging like a diamond ring
I cut the tape and do my thing, give me the paper
Keep the fame, I'm off the leash, you keep the cage
I ain't playing, keep the games
I'm the beast they couldn't tame
The one the witness coundn't name
I'm the perp they couldn't blame
Smoking citrus in my chain
Chopping Christmas with my blade
While my bitches entertain
I got vicious in my veins
I got hate all in my heart
I got revenge all in my brain
Now you just heard a killer start
Snatch a bitch and pull her braids
Smack her ass and rode the wave
I just give that bitch a look
Ain't got to tell the ho behave
When she acting like a dog, I'm a treat her like a stray
Ran her mouth for a hour but I keep it for a day, ay!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got the connect on that Escobar
Yams in the restaurant
Beef on a fork, got burnt, cooked, extra-hot
Carol City, Colombia
Put a hundred and one in ya
Sticks on that carpet, crib looking like a lumberyard
White Pablo cocaine
Way out in Spokane
Fuck I look like, listening to these poor lames
I drive some shit that'll take up like four lanes
This MMG piece gotta lift this with four cranes
I grip on my oak grain
And toke on this dope green
My bitches is supreme, and this ain't no new thing
These pits ain't gonna curr, but you pussies gon' purr
That ain't that clean and this package pure
