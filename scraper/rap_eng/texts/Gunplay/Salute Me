[Verse 1: Gunplay]
I grind everyday like nothing left
I don’t see none of these niggas, that’s what I tell myself
Grab the fire off the shelf
And the Bible, too
Every step I take, I think "What would my rival do?"
I’m just trying to be rich, you tryna be snitch
I hate a pussy ass nigga and a slimy bitch
They rather see you die in piss than rock a diamond wrist
But with this Glock in my pocket I holla this

[Hook: Peryon]
Salute when you see me, homie
Really action in these streets, whodie
Rifle, AR15 loaded
Plus the infrared beam on me
I’m nothing like the pussy lame rap niggas you watch on TV at night
I’m gangsta gangsta
Well respected through the hood
I’m really bout that life

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
I walk in these streets, collar and leash on the mark of the beast
Cold breeze reveal chalk under leafs
Fuck your beliefs, I’m here to fuck all that up
Never robbed in my life, I’m the one that stuck all that up
I’m just dyin' to kill but I’m tryin' to chill
I won’t stop still whack 'em and I’ll finally will
Catch me climbing up on every hill
Catch you slipping cause my ratchet got a slimy feel

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
AR15, straight scar the scene
Only way you breathing if the grace of God intervene
I’m bringing trouble on the double, my double back gon' be mean
Niggas gon' perish, they babies and parents gon bleed
Fuck rap, I play target practice with plaques
You beefing on freestyles, I see you in latch
Just me you and gats
Clap, here come attourneys
Gurneys and rats, burn 'em

[Hook]
