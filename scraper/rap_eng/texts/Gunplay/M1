[Hook]
A M1 here, a M1 there
Everywhere M1, niggas don't care
A M1 here, a M1 there
Everywhere M1, niggas don't care
Niggas don't care
Niggas don't care
M1 here, niggas don't care
A M1 there, niggas don't care
Everywhere M1, niggas don't care
[Verse 1]
Niggas don't care, nigga just won't bare
Nigga only knew powder and the product's all pale
Still snort pills and my avalanche chills
Black magic wheels just snappin' at your heels
That nigga gone, gone to the avalanche chill
Tryin' to chill but I can turn savage at will
Let these fuck ass judges slam the gavel out of fear
I pray they rot in hell and shed not a tear
I'm ridin' for my niggas with the muddy laces
Up five, see how good God grace is
This the mob bitch
Ain't no time for sob faces
When the hammer hit the share
That's the law nature another

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
No prints on the rental, limo tints on the razors
Foggin' up the windows, been in up the princess
Every Molly got my body feelin' like I'm out of body
I'll be high and above the rim, Amare Stoudemire
A dummy by the week, just now found a buyer
Now you know it's 'bout time to raise my body higher
Pussy nigga you ain't bad, you just dancin' 'round the fire
Non state searchin' me in action by my fire
Now what they want to know?
How much you spendin'
Now what they want to know?
How good you livin'
Now what they want to know?
I tell'em mind your business say ain't nuttin' over here
But some cash and some killers

[Hook]
