[Hook: Gunplay]
Check mine, your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Check mine, your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Check mine, your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Check mine, your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Niggas talkin' gun shit, and how they run shit
And how they done shit, nobody ever done shit
Nigga who you burpin' for? Who you workin' for?
You a pimp ho? Oh, who you twerkin' for?
I don't need a bravo for this novel
I want this message just to travel over gravel
All I want is what I earned, I applied what I learned
Live fast, crash, survived in the burn
Laughed when niggas told me that they passed up my turn
Since when you bastards concerned?
Motherfuckers still hate you if you ash in the urn
If you standin' on the corner or you pass 'em on the curb
Fuck 'em all I'm in the Mall, you just a toilet in my stall
You gotta rock a chain to avoid who you are
Pussy in the flesh, gush drippin' down your dress
Conscience died with the rest, so what the fuck can I confess?
You ain't sayin' nothin', it's just a front
Your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun [x2]

[Hook: Gunplay]
Check mine, your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Check mine, your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Check mine, your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Check mine, your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Check mine, yeah, that check mine
Tech 9, respect mine
Never quit tryin', told myself "I'mma do better this time"
But that time never came 'round
They tried to stick me up, but I never layed down
They tried to hit us up, but dawg laughed at the sign
Shot back faster than an Aston Martin Mile
Left the ratchet on the ground for the crime
Y'all seen me at my lowest, my poorest
Now see me win awards for fakin' like a poet
To who I owe it and for who I wrote it, and they know it
For them I praise the Lord, damn who took my life and press the forward?
I ain't hyped off the hype
Or stunned off the lights
This shit in my palm now, the size of a bite
Yeah I done wrong, but my rhymes only right
Motherfucker this the mob and my ties only tight
You ain't sayin' nothin', it's just a front

[Hook: Gunplay]
Your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Check mine, your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
You ain't sayin' nothin', it's just a front
Your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Check mine, your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Your rap sheet ain't longer than your gun
Check mine
