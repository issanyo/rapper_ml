[Lyrics to be added]

[Intro: PJK]
I could never be the same like you
It just won't do, it just won't do

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
I asked the pastor, what's the fastest way to Heaven
He said Porsche 911, with the Turbo
Took a shot of Cuervo, snatched the keys and got my swerve on
Screaming out "I won't be back!", that I put my balls and word on
I hope my demons won't relapse
I'm grippin grain and switching lanes evading fame and maiden name
How in the fuck I survive? I don't even know myself I ask myself everyday I'm alive
Don't nobody know me until somebody owe me mine
Watch somebody gon be lyin
Jump the border line and then I turned my water wine
Cuz all that shit there watered down
Now come get some porterhouse
I don't beg, borrow ever
Today, tomorrow never
My nigga I got my own pair
My nigga I'm on my own hill

[Hook: PJK]
Hustling, making moves under city lights, they know my name (know my name, they know my name)
I make this shit look easy but believe me it's been so much pain (so much pain)
I'm losing all my partners cuz the police tryna lock us
It's just me, my dope, and choppa
Ain't too many roads to choose
I refuse to lose, I can never be the same like you
It just won't do
It just won't do

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
I pour my heart all in my arts, skeletons all in my dark
Just a felon hella drunk and stumbled in a synagogue
Cognac and ten cigars, dirty guns and messy wards
Ain't no private jets and tours, just some partners, hoes, and Coors
Hit the interstate for dinner plates cuz this here ain't gon' do
Child support is late, and this cut cocaine just ain't gon' move
And this nigga owe me money so we traded that in jewels
Caught a case and made the news, now I'm forced to make the rules

[Hook: PJK]
Hustling, making moves under city lights, they know my name (know my name, they know my name)
I make this shit look easy but believe me it's been so much pain (so much pain)
I'm losing all my partners cuz the police tryna lock us
It's just me, my dope, and choppa
Ain't too many roads to choose
I refuse to lose, I can never be the same like you
It just won't do
It just won't do

[Bridge x2: Gunplay, (PJK)]
It's just me, my dope, and choppa
Counting money on the carpet
I'ma sell it 'til I sold it
I'ma wet, whip it, lock it
(I can never be the same like you)
(It just won't do)
(It just won't do)

[Hook: PJK]
Hustling, making moves under city lights, they know my name (know my name, they know my name)
I make this shit look easy but believe me it's been so much pain (so much pain)
I'm losing all my partners cuz the police tryna lock us
It's just me, my dope, and choppa
Ain't too many roads to choose
I refuse to lose, I can never be the same like you
It just won't do
It just won't do
