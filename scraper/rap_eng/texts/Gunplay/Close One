Hot damn man, man that was a close one
Hot damn man, man that was a close one
Hot damn man, man that was a close one
Hot damn man, man that was a close one

[Verse 1: Terry Sky
Man I check in my mirrors, countin' my ones
Go got a warrant, ride on the run
I got the product, nigga, and Ra got the gun
Damn right we on a mission, we ain't ridin' for fun, we trappin'
When I'm [?]
You can smell that herb and that it's lit
I'm screamin' hold that down, I see the D's
If they pull me, they gon' search a nigga's shit, hell nah
And I ain't for that
I get money but a nigga can't afford that
And let me tell you that a nigga got A1 sittin' in the stash
In the bag in the floor wrapped, boy you better (push)
Nigga floor that
Skizzy's in the back, he's where the door at
And if the boys decide to go and bring the dogs back
I'll get murder if they noticin' them raw packs
Not to mention that my boy strapped
Just the thought got me sweatin' in my ball cap
But them cops keep callin' and as long as we ballin'
You will never get the chance to see the ball back, nigga
I got the D's on my ass
I just seen them creep past, got shaky feet on the dash
Stay street and I dash, like 83 on the dash
In the corner, lose the bucket, switch the V, move your ass
We gone

Hot damn man, man that was a close one
Hot damn man, man that was a close one
Hot damn man, man that was a close one
Hot damn man, man that was a close one

[Verse 2: Taj Mahal]
Nigga said he got them bricks for the low
It's a mothafuckin' drought so you know I gotta toast one
I gotta cook one, if the shit cook right and it lock up on sight
I got enough to buy 4, son
Shit, it look real good
But a real nigga know that don't mean nothin'
Little flake and some acetone'll
Have a broke nigga with some weak work in the streets frontin'
So I tell him (what you tell him?)
Es√© you gotta meet me in the kitchen
Say hello, nigga with me got that stick on him
And his trigger finger itchin'
It's gon' swim, ain't it?
You gave me your word, papi
I don't wanna have to take it out the water
Then hit it with a knife to make it dry, papi, no!
He said word to his daughter
I take it to myself, fuck that bitch
Man, swear that it's A1
Get to the stove and a nigga can't bring back shit
Now that ain't work, is it, papi?
Cause I ain't no fool
I got my eye on the water like a lifeguard at the pool
I see it, it's lockin' up, it's swimmin'
I can see the [?] in that water
[?], I'm grinnin'
I'm turnin', turnin', twistin'
I got that fork on it, it's fluffin'
Threw the cold water on that shit
And goddamn the Pyrex busted
But I saved it

Hot damn man, man that was a close one
Hot damn man, man that was a close one
Hot damn man, man that was a close one

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
Always an inside job
When a nigga get flipped or robbed
Or when a nigga get ratted on
Now a nigga sittin' here behind the wall
Like a mothafuckin' animal
Ain't even have one hand involved
Sold him a dime, that pussy nigga lyin'
Talkin' 'bout I served him an avalanche
Call up the ambulance
Straight through the vest, through the kevlar
Should've never talked to the babbler
Lead and chrome, dead and gone
Just like that there
Bust a nigga's head, left that right there
I mean like... green light
On everything right here
I'm not gon' boast, but I got them oaks
I swang them thangs like goddamn Sammy Sos'
On every coast, 'bout that bread
Put a body on every toast, hit him up very close
No games, get played, with me, not never
Not then, not now, no time, not ever
You know me, you owe me, I need mine so show me
Wood grain on the AK, permanent vacay homie
