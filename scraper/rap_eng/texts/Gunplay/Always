[Hook: Que]
I always keep me some paper
I'm always out kicking flavor
I've always been a damn player
And it's always a fuck nigga hating
Always, always
Always, always
Always, always
Always, always

[Verse 1: Que]
I'm always on alert always with the strap
I don't ever go raw, always use a hat
Always blow the sack, always get it back
Bitch, I'mma make her play, always make her cap
Always, always, always, always, always
Always with a freak, new face every week
Always get cheese, always tame my sheep
Always on flash in New York last week
1500 for the shoes on my feet
Always fucking on another nigga bitch
Already get twice, now try threepeat
It's always a fuck nigga mad at me
Cause your bitch on my Twitter begging for a Retweet
And my D done look like a strip club
Cause the nigga pictures all on my IG

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Always been one hundred
But it's always a fuck nigga stopping my money
I always find a way around that though
Cause I always got me some bomb ass dope
Always in the court room
Always screaming: "lay down, don't move!"
Always keep a bitch on deck
And a clip in the Tec for the threat
Cause the game that we playing ain't no rules
Always touring, always got a warrant
Always see the judge in the morning
Always shackled from the wrist to the ankle
And a nigga never saying: "I'm sorry"
Always running around higher than a motherfucker
Geeked up looking like "try me, motherfucker!"
Always been a nigga 'bout mine
Always been a nigga 'bout swinging that iron

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Always ridin' in a new whip
Always see me with a new bitch
Couldn't walk a mile in my shoes at the shoe fit
I got some more money, I don't know what to do with it
Rich nigga shit, snowboarding out in Salt Lake
Mind your business, pay attention what the boss says
Crack your egg put it back in the carton
You wanna be famous now your face on the carton
Pardon my French, doing shows out in Paris
Presidential out in Hilton, had to call Paris
I was fucking with your bitch till she talk 'bout marriage
Come around my hood you gon' have to have clearance
I'm the King of the trap, aim game nice, born mean with the strap
Always talkin' 'bout money, all I need is the racks
On purp, on xanx, on lean to the back
Flocka!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tracy T]
Always Rolex, always VVS
Sky Dweller on my wrist and I got a president
Always got the heater, bad bitch [?]
Pour it up by the liter and a Beamer with the features
Always get money you could tell by these spades
Dope boy's ice jumping off a nigga neck
And I'm like a cooler when I got the Frank Mueller
That's a dope boy watch on a dope boy wrist
Rich nigga shit, I done dropped a couple bricks
My wrist look sunny and your wrist look cloudy
I done dropped a hundred thou'
Got money, let it pile
Got a cocaine mile, got snow I needa plow
Get to the money, we got new paper
Got a million out in Decatur
Always goin' up, always out in Vegas

[Hook]
