[Intro]
I don't rob no more
Steal a ride, I pack a 2
Ski a slow, act a fool
I'm a murker ghoul
You don't want my true circle dude
And these killers gonna do what they paid to do

[Hook]
Everything I say so goddamn low life
Every song I play so goddamn low life
Hard class steel, such a goddamn low life
Pride, cash deals, such a goddamn low life
Low life, low life
Low life my whole life
Low life, low life
Low life my whole life

[Verse 1]
Human methadone now leave me the F alone
I take your bitch and F her dome
It's me they wishin' death upon
Human methadone now leave me the F alone
I take your bitch and F her dome
It's me they wishin' death upon
F 'em all, safety on the F-in off
Call the trauma truck I'm a check his pulse
Swing back, Ridge Mars, search and destroy
All I have in this world is a pistol nigga piss poor
Now I throw my dues up in the two thousand new some
Rainin' cats and dogs but I don't want the roof up
Get your issue here I got deuce
You disappear like bishop Pierce, I do not choose
My angle obtuse, Triple C my family tree
I ain't roots, I ain't see, I ain't do

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I just shot and been shot at, rob robbers, boss bosses 'round
O's and E's, Wheel of Fortune style
Low life, wouldn't trust the neither
Pedigree amphetamine feel, pills 'round the reefer
Have these niggers' women, never bought diamonds
We just wait for you to get it, now we all got 'em
All papers chief, this PO makes me sick
Another test stress, fuck it, use the baby's piss
Low life, been bout' it
Party harder than that day they murdered Bin Laden
Black and yellow chains, black and yellow fit
When I throw co lethal, wait before I cut the check

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Went through my low life fast
Still lovin' these strip clubs
Dance is off for two hundred but I'm on the pill and I'm on six dubs
Low life of my whole life to my paper loan
My trap doin' so good, might get to extra zones
And I ain't even talkin' about no clean money
I'm talkin' dope profit that keep that triple bean jumpin'
Hundred thousand dollar car but ain't no fuckin' gas
I'm one hundred in the hood, you had to pay to pass
Robbin' for the same work we sold to you
Might take all your new shit, look like it's old to you
That purple in my swisher got me seeing shit
I just bought another chopper that ain't seen the clip

[Hook]
