[Chorus]
(Work), who the fuck is this callin' my phone? (work)

Six o'clock in the motherfuckin' morning (work)
Trap stay bumpin', phone doin' numbers (work)
Up all night, gettin' to the fuckin' money

[Verse 1]
Started with a three five hard, then I had to beat my charge
Up, I had to keep my guard
Icebox where I keep my heart (work)
Cold blooded, hoes love it (work)
Dope boy and some dope boy money (work)
Dope boy Dickies and a dope boy rental (work)
Ain't babysittin' nothin', I'ma sell it
Okay, there the work go (work)
God dang, where the work go? (work)
I be in the field in the first row (work)
Flood in the drought, where the thirst go? (work)
Twenty-eight five right now, what the burst for? (work)
Same thing what the verse for (work)
Eleven hunduns for the onion (work)
Add another dollar when I front one (work)
Sellin' chicken wings, thinkin' bigger things (work)
Slangin' rock to the fellas, Jigga Man (work)
Big body whip, can't pick a lane (work)
Cocaine bounce back, ricochet (work)
Fuck what a nigga say (whip one, work)

[Chorus]
Who the fuck is this callin' my phone? (work)
Six o'clock in the motherfuckin' morning (work)
Trap stay bumpin', phone doin' numbers (work)

Fuck is this callin' my phone? (work)
Six o'clock in the motherfuckin' morning (work)
Trap stay bumpin', phone doin' numbers (work)
Up all night, gettin' to the fuckin' money

[Verse 2]
White girl, cutie pie, cocaine (work)
Sell that ho broad day, no shame (work)
Dope frames, stolen gold chain (work)
Got a thick redbone, cold flame (work)
Dick her down good, screamin' both names (work)
Right back slangin' to the dope fiends (work)
Fresh bomb, got the doors on knock knock (work)
Put it on WorldStar, top box (work)
Brown brick in a Crown Vic (work)
Bad tag and the loud lit (work)
Gettin' dome head 'cause she on red (work)
Send a ho hungry with a cold stare (work)
Trap line on blow up (work)
Flood the hood, call Noah (work)
Trappin' 'til the folks show up (work)
Scramble out the back door (work)
Skeetin' and slush on my Dickies and Chucks (work)
Talkin' codes on the phones like we speakin' in tongues (work)
Then take an ounce, I make three out of one (work)
I got brown, I got white, that's Obama and Trump (work)

[Chorus]
Who the fuck is this callin' my phone? (work)
Six o'clock in the motherfuckin' morning (work)
Trap stay bumpin', phone doin' numbers (work)
