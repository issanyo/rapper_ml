[Hook:]

I'm a shooter
(Shooter, shooter, shooter)
Walk up on me crazy I shoot you
I'm a shooter
(Shooter, shooter, shooter)
Walk up on me crazy I shoot you
Little nigga dying in the street
Tell your man he don't want to see me
Niggas talking all of that shit
He don't really want to see me
Ber, stick'em, ha ha haha stick'em
Ber, stick'em, ha ha haha stick'em
I'm a shooter
(Shooter, shooter, shooter)
Walk up on me crazy I shoot you
I'm a shooter
(Shooter, shooter, shooter)
Walk up on me crazy I shoot you

[Verse 1: Alley Boy]

I'm a shooter, strapped with a Ruger
Play me nigga I'm a do you
I don't want to fight
I don't want to tustle
? I'm a shoot you
Clip run through you, ask my jeweler
25 racks, that's on my mueller
85 racks, that's on my car
Came from the hood bitch, I'm a star
? shooter
?
Them choppers tinted, ain't no good
All in the A, back to the basics
Youngin's chains with a K
Break them stick off in your face
Money major, I'm a G
I got wars in the street
I got shooters, shoot for free
I got bitches ? for free
I'm a shooter, I'm a shooter
Bitch ass nigga you a poodle
Pit bull with no bite
Walk up on me crazy I shoot you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gunplay]

Stick a motherfucker for a chain
Stick a motherfucker for a watch
Stick a motherfucker for a ring
I'm a stick a motherfucker if you don't watch
Get slapped with the .22 Tre
I ain't crying with the boohoo face
Pussy nigga where the jewels and the safe?
Where the blocks at? These just apes
You ain't no gangster, you ain't no pimp
You ain't no killer, you a fo-fo
So cold, snow cone
We chilly, really?
I don't think you want this Benni
Cause this really ain't no scrimmage
My nigga done play for keeps
Y'all niggas playing for image
My nigga died in his dirty laces
And about 30 open cases
And they owe me a little bread, damn
My nigga that's crazy
But that's the game we balling in
Get murked for a Bentley ornament
Shooters shooting, like it's a motherfucking 3 point tournament
