[Intro]
Holdin on my choppa, I don’t give a fuck
All black, ski mask, how them killers come
5% tense and a couple clips
All a dope boy need and we ain’t seein shit

[Hook: Young Breed]
Well these niggas lookin like a bitch when I drive by
People lookin, thinkin I'm da lick when I drive by
That's at least until they see the stick when I drive by
Know you lookin at a couple bricks when I drive by
When I drive by, when I drive by
When I drive by
When I drive by, when I drive by
When I drive by

[Verse 1: Torch]
Gloves on, no prints, mask on, no leads
.38, no shells left, you fuck niggas gon see
Ain't no play, ain't no hold up
You gon suffer, you gon bleed
I drive by, fire fire fire
IOU, nigga I OD
Nigga MOG, ain't no peace
Please kill it kill it, feel it
For this money I put yo bitch ass on the skillet skillet
Race be the snow I'm dealin
Drive past, no ceiling
Brick fabric, God willin
100 shots in my mellon
Big back,I'm OF
Smoke large, I smoke stress
You don't get right, she get left
She on the rag, I get neck
I'm lookin like a million dollar check
60 racks in my pocket, 60 racks on my neck
100 shooters on deck and they with it
Put that bag up and get smashed up and let's get em
Grew after what you get it too, boy that's how it be
Turn yo hood to a track meet when that choppa squeeze

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Look round, pullin up
Jumpin out, putting down
Show stopping your profit
Short temper, long barrel
Pussy nigga said something, here come red rum
Shit talkin muthafucker, now you's a dead one
Drive up, drive through
Drive by, all that
Ridin til the wheels fall off or they all flat
44 them, no motive
Leave a nigga so totaled
For every one of yo's I got 4 loaded
Try and shoot a nigga in the club, in the mug
Aks geeda, he was there, try to hit him up
Nuck ahead, throwin knuckles – that's a gitter bug
Eatin niggas' food before the dinner done
Two hand guns get clapped right here
Yea, a nigga bow down right there
When you round all these killas better act like them
Or you could be the vic and get sack like em
Well these niggas lookin like a bitch when I drive by
People lookin, thinkin I'm delict when I drive by
That's at least until they see the stick when I drive by
Know you lookin at a couple bricks when I drive by

[Hook]
