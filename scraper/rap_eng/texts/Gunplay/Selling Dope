[Verse 1: Yowda]
Food service, water whippin'
Metric units, small division
Two stoves, one kitchen
Three microwaves, ceramic dishes
Sellin' dope, that's the family business
My uncle Leon, he be the family chemist
Nigga where you at, I can send it
C.O.D., need my cash soon as you get it
It's so exquisite, I mean the cars and bitches
End your existence, these niggas with me killers
I'm shining on 'em, boy it's hard to miss it
I'm from Vegas, you get money you should come and visit

[Chorus: Yowda]
Pushing work, gang relations
Sippin' Hi-Tech, low on patience
Smoking weed, popping pills, we heavy medicated
Fuck the feds, my plug ducking immigration
Pushing work, gang relations
Sippin' Hi-Tech, low on patience
Smoking weed, popping pills, we heavy medicated
Fuck the feds, my plug ducking immigration

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
It's Hell Gang, Life of Hell, it ain't no other gang
You know I had to run the check up for a hundred days
At home been callin', I'm just making sure my mother straight
You know I'm callin' home to make sure my lil brother straight
A hundred K inside the safe, I be like fuck a bank
This dirty money pay the realest nigga fuck you think
If you's a real one you relate to all this gangster shit
At thirty-eight it get you spanked, my niggas play with sticks
Them Pebble Beach niggas be bangin' on some brazy shit
I'm with the scuba dude ain't shootin' like you say he is
It's teddy bears and candlelights when we be taking trips
You talkin' like you quaking shit but you ain't make the trip

[Chorus: Yowda]
Pushing work, gang relations
Sippin' Hi-Tech, low on patience
Smoking weed, popping pills, we heavy medicated
Fuck the feds, my plug ducking immigration
Pushing work, gang relations
Sippin' Hi-Tech, low on patience
Smoking weed, popping pills, we heavy medicated
Fuck the feds, my plug ducking immigration

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
Cop a top, shoppin' out the clip
Do me bogus, I cannot forgive
I'm a crown holder, only chip
My core connect and killers know me still
Havin' feels, that's my only fear
Cocaine, that's a sugar hill
Uh, D-boy fresh, three Corvettes
G4 jets, go peace on jets
Don Logan slogan, count it with my arms folded
Man the work was gettin' lonely, kept it company with soda
If the money ain't the motive nigga you don't need to know them
If the paper ain't proper, got a chopper I could show them, lam lam

[Chorus: Yowda]
Pushing work, gang relations
Sippin' Hi-Tech, low on patience
Smoking weed, popping pills, we heavy medicated
Fuck the feds, my plug ducking immigration
Pushing work, gang relations
Sippin' Hi-Tech, low on patience
Smoking weed, popping pills, we heavy medicated
Fuck the feds, my plug ducking immigration
