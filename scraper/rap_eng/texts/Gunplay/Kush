[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Mary Jane's flowers, Mary Jane's flowers
Mary Jane's flowers, Mary Jane's flowers
That kush, that kush, that kush
That kush, that kush, that kush
I'm on that kush, that kush, that kush
That kush, that kush
Mary Jane's flowers

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I don't smoke no reggie
I don't smoke no mid
I'm always fucking high
So much we might have kids
And why you babysitting a blunt
That's that shit I don't like
I'm looking for one of these bad bitches
To come ride me like a turnpike
On some real shit I'm a pothead
Please don't blow my high man
Look into my eyes and
It look like I'm from Thailand
I am smoking on that gas
Life should be on Cinemax
Smoking on that OG in that double-R
I'm Real Relaxed
I smoke so much kill they call me Killa
And I'm on that strong, I'm on that strong â€“ bodybuilder
Light that shit then pass it
My white girl on that acid
But me I'm on that kush, that kush
Tunechi

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I got a big bouquet of Mary Jane's flowers
Mary Jane's flowers, Mary Jane's flowers
(Gunplay fuck with me)
And I got a big bouquet of Mary Jane's flowers
Mary Jane's flowers, Mary Jane's flowers
That kush, that kush, that kush
That kush, that kush, that kush
That kush, that kush, that kush
That kush, that kush
Mary Jane's flowers

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Belaire bottle, big bubba bouquet
And by the look at my paint, man it's a wonderful spray
Sucker trynna fuck my high up on a sucker-free day
I told that sucker park your whip cause this a sucker-free lane
Harry Hoover Hussein, kickass weed, Wu-Tang
B's for big on the Bentley, can't squeeze through lanes
Raw papers in Jamaica, eat some ackee, roll a eighth up
I be hippy blitzed, trippy sticks, activate the vapors
And this anthrax wax give you asthma attacks
I'm a smoker, you's a choker, go on and pass that back
Lightning weed, that's my dope style
Eyes lower than my profile
This'll hit your lung, you'll cough both out

[Hook]
And I got a big bouquet of Mary Jane's flowers
Mary Jane's flowers, Mary Jane's flowers
And I got a big bouquet of Mary Jane's flowers
Mary Jane's flowers, Mary Jane's flowers
That kush, that kush, that kush
That kush, that kush, that kush
That kush, that kush, that kush
That kush, that kush
Mary Jane's flowers

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Kush in the swisher, couldn't be sweeter
I'm talkin' P-80 mine, and THC off the meter
I spark 'em up in the theater, cloud so thick
Heavy on real estate, house your bitch
Black bottle for boss, I'm burnin' like Biggie
Bob Marley and Ziggy, my niggas we run the city
It's a very thin line, you can candy-paint mine
All I want is Chevys and the best kush I could find
Sixty in the bank, another hundred on my mind
When we started out with Reggie we were barely gettin' dimes
We were barely gettin' dimes
Now all we fuck is dimes

[Hook]
And I got a big bouquet of Mary Jane's flowers
Mary Jane's flowers, Mary Jane's flowers
(Smoke somethin)
And I got a big bouquet of Mary Jane's flowers
Mary Jane's flowers, Mary Jane's flowers
That kush, that kush, that kush
That kush, that kush, that kush
That kush, that kush, that kush
That kush, that kush
Mary Jane's flowers


[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And you know we on that kush
Yeah, you know we on that kush
Fuckin' with that kush
Nothin' but that kush
We ain't smokin' nothing but that kush
Don't pass it if it ain't that kush
That kush, that kush
