[Intro: Rick Ross]
Run with me or run from me
The worse come to worst
It's only gonna be gunplay
Feel me nigga

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm sittin' at the table, countin' my money
Ain't where I wanna be, but I got a few hundred
Lot of talk on the street, like a nigga crossin' me
Well it's somethin' I gotta see
Is it how chain swing? Tired of my face
Tellin' lies gettin' niggas wives tied up and raped
Similar to the mob, deeper than the rap
All you niggas gettin' robbed, all the cell phones tapped
Bullet in my head, bullet in my chest
Yeah they want a nigga dead, they envy my success
To be loved, to be loved
Oh what a feelin', 100 rounds in the drum
Niggas gettin' whacked no sympathy for the soft
Niggas snitchin', I know bitches who clippin' you dick off
I'm a boss, champagne with the steak
Pink Rosay jason, Ace by the case
Brisco line 2, young nigga what it do?
He got a pretty shone and he wanna bring her through
That's love, we go back to the blue house
And if she bad enough, may take her to the new house
My Maserati be the new body
Got ya girls panties wetter than a pool party, nigga
I got her sleepin' in the king size
Last night I had that bitch sittin' ringside

[Hook: Gunplay]
You wanna go that route?
I been on this road before
I know gunplay, you know gunplay
Shootin' for the win, but ready for the loss
Both lines on the tip of my finger
Yellin' bring it, I'm swingin' that iron
When I'm swingin' that iron
Ain't thinkin' 'bout time
Ain't thinkin' 'bout mine
Ain't thinkin' 'bout dyin'

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My niggas so street, my swishers so sweet
All this money on the table, how a nigga gon' sleep?
Speculation of my deal, it was over 10 mil
Blowin' herb, chauffeur plus a home didn't feel
Beat the case like Gotti, we the trill murder inc
I race, slip 'n slide, they arraign me in the mink
Look Ted in the eye, it's the end of the road
And the birth of Maybach, mean I'm gettin' more dough
Smellin' Christian Dior, I used to be poor
When ya cross Florida line, boy I'm your leader
Booby boys still, booby boys real
You can name a lot of lames that the booby boys killed
Brisco line 2, young nigga what it do?
Say he got a couple kilos and he wanna bring 'em through
That's love we go back to the blue house
And if he brought enough I may buy me a new house

[Hook: Gunplay]
You wanna go that route?
I been on this road before
I know gunplay, you know gunplay
Shootin' for the win, but ready for the loss
Both lines on the tip of my finger
Yellin' bring it, I'm swingin' that iron
When I'm swingin' that iron
Ain't thinkin' 'bout time
Ain't thinkin' 'bout mine
Ain't thinkin' 'bout dyin'

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
Gettin' how I'm livin' it
Damn near dyin' for every digit I get
Fuck they know 'bout that?
I ain't never put shit on the line, just shit in they rhymes
I shoot a nigga shittin' around
These internet niggas, these ain't a threat niggas
Never seen a laptop in the projects nigga
Just powder, cut with comet
Fuck them comets, convicts ain't buyin' it
If they ain't coppin' or fryin' it
Don't get a nigga fired up behind some fuck shit
My nigga then what then?
Who that behind the curtain I'll murk 'em
Wizard of Oz ass niggas
Hidin' behind money, hidin' behind luxury
Shootin' up all that fuck shit
It's getting ugly
Got Torch on the line, says he got a couple 9's
Told him grab 2, bring 'em on through

[Hook: Gunplay]
You wanna go that route?
I been on this road before
I know gunplay, you know gunplay
Shootin' for the win, but ready for the loss
Both lines on the tip of my finger
Yellin' bring it, I'm swingin' that iron
When I'm swingin' that iron
Ain't thinkin' 'bout time
Ain't thinkin' 'bout mine
Ain't thinkin' 'bout dyin'
