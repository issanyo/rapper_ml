[Verse 1]
Fresh off in that pan
Rozay throw me that alley
Watch the backboard shatter
This some jackboy chatter
This a thief's theme
Intervene with automatics
Knock a lame right off the ladder and laugh at em'
Police knowing that I'm ducking
[Censored]
Bitch you knowing that I'm bucking
These pussy niggas mine
Time to blow 'em out they covers
Taking all they bitches
Fucking all their mothers
Just a rolex and my rubbers
Rich, angry
Military issue banger
Niggas be rapping tough
In them cuffs, niggas be singers
Niggas be green
Niggas be pie
Niggas be pussy, nigga not I
Nigga not never, nigga not then
Nigga not now, nigga na-ah
Have you yelling, begging out Allah
For a nigga to leave you alive
Nigga that ain't what's happenin'
No ReRun no Raj
No boofle no fraud
I'm up against no odds
Voodoo beads and jewerly up against my heart
I piss fish flounder
I get it from the founder
Dirty money under that table
I spend it over that counter
Ain't no hustle that I don't know
I'm eating now
I'm chowing up
Bogota Medell√≠n
Turn it up, it ain't loud enough

[Hook]
I'm throwing rocks at the chain game
I'm throwing rocks at the chain game
I'm throwing rocks at the chain game
I'm throwing rocks at the chain game
I'm throwing rocks at the chain game
I'm throwing rocks at the chain game
I'm throwing rocks at the chain game
I'm throwing rocks at the chain game
Come on
I told you
