[Intro: Gunplay]
Put down, count that shit
What that is?
OK!

[Hook x2: Gunplay]
I threw that grip on her
Got her in the whip and threw that dick on her
She let my partner hit, she out there big hoeing
She get it how she live, she out there big hoeing
She get it how she live!

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
She butt naked twerking, tryna cop that Birkin
I cut behind the curtain, tore it down for certain
Told her I be back, she said you now where I be at
Right here popping pussy trying to push it to the max
She gladly do that shit for daddy
Cause she never tripping when I ask to see some pussy and some nipples
She know the routine, knock her straight out the bikini
Then I bust a nut and then I play Houdini!

[Hook: Gunplay]

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Bitch you looking dumb he a zero, I'm the one
He rapping like a hero cause he don’t see my gun
She a stone cold pole player, oh yeah, oh yeah
That’s one stone cold ho there
Knew a bitch named Mona what she do wit a Corona
Make a nigga wanna own her and hater bone her
She acting like she conceited, but I know she just a eater
She acting like she love me, I’m acting like I need her
She get it how she live, she out there big hoeing
She get it how she live!

[Hook: Gunplay]

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
She hoein' real big, right fast, real quick
Gimmie the money and the joint, bitch pass that shit!
Hold up! Hoe ash that shit, yo cut my check
Bitch cash that shit!
She wanted daddy with a fat wallet and frequent flier mileage
You never catch a bitch being one of my problems
Never let a bitch count one of my dollars
Never let a bitch pop one of my condoms
