Rollin' Cee-Lo, bout a thousand below
I ain't crabbin', I'm a head-crackin' hero
Don't be fucking with my Fritos, bitch
She drinking generations when she eat on dick
She pee on tricks and tell me they don't trip
My paint ain't scratched, yo nigga shit on skip
Microphone check bitches stomping on strips
Running on hope, chasin' down a wish
She need a daddy that's solid with a fat wallet
She feels safe when I'm pilot
Pimping big business bout as old as time is
They love my rhymin', but lust my diamonds
You think that slut a goddess? Shit, couple dollars got her
I be hard on this hoes, slapping bras off these hoes
Can't pay attention, better pawn somethin', ho
Drop her to the flo', bitch, lost something, ho
You gotta pay this, pay that, tell me something I don't know
Go get your take it off, take it off
Now go and make it all

Take it off, take it off
Now go and make it all
