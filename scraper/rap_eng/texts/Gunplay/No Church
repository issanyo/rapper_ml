[Intro]
This is the fucking shit I be talking about
Half rapping ass motherfuckers
You think it's a game?
You think it's a fucking game?
Come on

[Verse 1]
You know how it go
For life my nigga, on site my nigga
Die slow, my nigga
Copy? Ten four my nigga
Real nigga on line
And I came just in time
You gotta go get yours, but I can scrap with mine
Motherfucker don't play with me, water grenade with me
And an A.K. with me, all day with me
And I got stones, a pocket full of dough's
And I got hoes, a couple of them yours
Hold up, M.M.G
That's murder, mayhem, god dammit that's me
C, C, C
Carol City Cartel, go hard here for the feat
Fuck how you feel
Give a fuck who you is, what you bout, what you done, who you killed
I set it off on any motherfucker out here
That's word to every motherfucker not here
I can smell the money, Makaveli money
Bounty on your brain, that's psychedelic money
I don't ask if I could, I'm good
Shoot, putting down at your baby mama crib like a brute
It's a medellin thing, coke amphetamine thing
Four four loaded, next to the King James
Low life, my niggas are sting rays
Hey, mom tied to the string rakes
One time for the inmates
My nigga B-Boy, my nigga V-Ray
My nigga Caino, they gon' be straight
This for the robbers, shaking all the cops on the E-way

[Outro x4]
No church for the rats nigga, nigga
