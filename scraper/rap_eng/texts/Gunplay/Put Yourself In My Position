Yeah
Real life

Birthdays was the worst day's now we sip champagne when we thirsty
And pour it on the models ima buy another bottle
Momma told me "go get em" and i got em
Cause back in the days we ain't had shit
Not a silver spoon
A pot that we can piss
If it wasn't for the oodles and noodles probably was the grits
Cause daddy he was dead,mama working a shift
So we was home alone just life Macaulay
Ice cream truck ride-in by we looking salty
Cold cold world when nobody's feelings sorry
Demons whispering all in my ear get em off me!

[Triple C's]
Get em off me!

No food in the fridge baby mama talking slick
Put yourself in my position whip it tryna to get rich
No whip to get to an interview, fuck a job then
Ski Mask everybody getting robbed then
Put yourself in my position intermission nah
Money non stop master culinary arts
Soon as the judge look at me throw the book at me
Self made society is shoo-kin me

[Triple C's]

I done did dat there for baby crib fare
For little gas money, a fit from adventurer
Picture me under age hustlin' at my church
So many times future in the church
Quick cocaine and i never had a hearse
Speed of year, Speed of life
Super man spirit
My life a real movie
All i do is at words
So once i hear the beat
All i do is add verbs

[Meek Mill]

How the judge gonna blame us
Dead broke sellin' dope but we came up
In the kitchen whippen' trying make the cane fluff
Put em in my shoes bet they do the same stuff

[Triple C's]

Put yourself in my position, how that feel
Put yourself in my position, how that feel
Put yourself in my position, tell me how that feel
Put yourself in my position, Now tell me how that feel

[Triple C's]

Shimmy shimmy ya, Shimmy ya, Shimmy yay
We don't know nothing but a quarter brick of yay
Granny said nah til dem bills got paid
My lil brother trappin' now but I can't blame whats in his veins
Same crowd nigga keep saying young'n chains so he just sit up on my
Lap with my new mothafuckin chain
Stacks on deck like they sticking on x and i only sip syrrup and
Drive faster than a bitch

[Magazeen]

Living never easy to carry on
Spending time on the studio music turn me on
Use to live...
Magazine..
The outside..
Life is a test if you.. after run success
To all my niggas in the street doing it best
No sleep street work only hustle

[Triple C's]

Put yourself in my position, how that feel
Put yourself in my position, how that feel
Put yourself in my position, tell me how that feel
Put yourself in my position, Now tell me how that feel
