[Gunplay]
I beg no pardon
I ain’t ask for this, I beg no stardom
I just wanted money, one eggroll, starving
Break down an onion watchin’ Creflo Dollar, life gets not harder
I got more money but no ho problems
Now more gold on collars
I just got one wish: get rich with my partners
Countin’ ’til it get monotonous
Dying broke it was never an option
So I’m forever on my mob shit
King James, all on my psalm shit
It gets no triller than these baguettes in the Mueller
Ferrari fast life, no fuel up… race straight to the jeweller
Put all my problems in a bottle
I guess I’m tryna drown ‘em
I’m tryna smile while y’all just tryna frown and

[Hook - Toothtaker]
Livin’ life by the knife, might die by the silence
Gettin’ high as a kite, still in low light
Violent when I fight, might earn my third strike
Never been my type, never learn, never right, alright?
(Fuck who don’t like it)

[Toothtaker]
Beg no pardon
I ain’t ask for this, you get what you bargain
I’m just gonna finish what you ignorantly started
You little dumb shits ain’t got the stomach to be heartless
All of y’all are garbage
All of y’all are targets, let’s see who gets the farthest
Ride or die, right, why you actin’ car sick? (Shit)
Knucklehead think he the smartest
A soft-ass act the hardest
But in reality just harmless
Flim flam from a bunch of scam artists
Fuck it, ’cause every casket needs a carcass
I’m out constantly causing carnage
You are constantly calling sergeants
And I’m in big trouble, criminal at large
And I get payback, then I catch more charges
Fuck it; I’mma do it all regardless
A real son of a gun, right?
My mother was a cartridge
Down to shoot to fill on sight
I’m somewhat of a marksman

Livin’ life by the knife, might die by the silence
Gettin’ high as a kite, still in low light
