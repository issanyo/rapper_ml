[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
Hang with my boys, swang with my boys
Sip drank with my boys
Watch me [?] switching lanes
I can-I can switch lanes
Switch lanes
Hang with my boys, swang with my boys
Sip drank with my boys
Watch me [?] switching lanes
I can-I can switch lanes
Switch lanes

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Fifty dollar pound a pack, Benz with no hat on
In the house counting stacks
I pull up on that tiger back switching lanes
I can-I can switch lanes
Switch lanes
Codeine in my cup, I strut on twenty inch
Never pen and pinch, my breathe is peppermint
I recline behind tint, leaving candy stains
Now watch me switch lanes like Ichabod Crane

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
Hang with my boys, swang with my boys
Sip drank with my boys
Watch me [?] switching lanes
I can-I can switch lanes
Switch lanes
Hang with my boys, swang with my boys
Sip drank with my boys
Watch me [?] switching lanes
I can-I can switch lanes
Switch lanes

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Switching lanes, switching cars
Switching bitches everyday like switching cars
Ain't no thang like bada-bang
I'm a player but I don't play a lot of games
Hanging with my folk, swerving like a pro
Swanging on these hoes like a Houston Astro
Batter up, caddy truck
Is you mad or mad as fuck
I'm coming down, sipping [?]

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
Hang with my boys, swang with my boys
Sip drank with my boys
Watch me [?] switching lanes
I can-I can switch lanes
Switch lanes
Hang with my boys, swang with my boys
Sip drank with my boys
Watch me [?] switching lanes
I can-I can switch lanes
Switch lanes

[Electronic Hook: RiFF RAFF]
Hang with my boys, swang with my boys
Sip drank with my boys
Watch me [?] switching lanes
I can-I can switch lanes
Switching lanes
Hang with my boys, swang with my boys
Sip drank with my boys
Watch me [?] switching lanes
I can-I can switch lanes
Switching lanes
