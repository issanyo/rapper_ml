[Intro: DJ Khaled]
I'm on my way
This goin' out to every hood
We gonna make it

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
(Hey) You can look into my eyes
See that I'm getting tired
6:00 in the morning
Money still on my mind
So if you want it
I'm the one to supply
Be there in no time (no time, no time)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way

[Verse 1: Bali]
Nigga this legendary, no ordinary shit
No ordinary bitches, no ordinary whips
4 bills nigga special like they 30
I come along way from food stamps and section 8
Niggas eatin' on these beats get yourself a plate
And I'm a step away, one hit a breath away
When you don't got time, you ain't never late
Come so Victory is here we can celebrate

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Ok, I'm on my grizzle, on my grind
Go ahead try, top my shine
I'm on my way, any day
Tell them niggas better have my cake
What you think, nigga you ain't
Have me laughing all the way to the bank
L O L, A M B, O R at the Gini baby
Had the chop the top off that bitch
Just so they can see me baby
Money I get, know that shit
Yeah he paid, notice it
Sleeping who, no can do
Motivation, ocean view
How I get it bitch you tripping
Ain't got nothing to do with you

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]

[Verse 3: BallGreezy]
Victory is on the way
Khaled go in on 'em
Show 'em we gonna win homey
Get off in their skin homey
I've been getting in the streets over 10 years
So you think a nigga pussy cause his ear's pierced
Run up on a nigga pussy if you want to
You gotta best be sure that it go through
BallGreezy gettin' money like he 'posed to
Good dope in the drop like soul food
Big Body, big rims on the old school
Stay fly like a hood nigga 'posed too
Lights off, click clack in the pinto
Seat back, dick sucked in the Benzo
5% DBs on the Renzo
No sleep, gotta eat, gotta get done

[Verse 4: Iceberg]
It's like I always say motherfucker here I come
Another victory for the crib a couple more before I'm done
And if you asleep you better wake up
And get on your fucking job
Cause I'm taking everything except a loss Iceberg goes off
Yeah 24/7 I goes on and I be scared I might miss money, so I don't doze off
I'm a snap and the streets know it, Trick told me keep going
An I'm a keep chiefin as long as god keep the weed growing

[Verse 5: Desloc]
Switch man been to official, I've been destined to shine
Won't take no for an answer, fuck nigga gimme mine
Never been selfish for real, I put on my whole city
I went from standing on corners to autographin' titties
My daddy gave my Virginia's King, A Richmond legend
A wise speaker, a woman pleaser, broke nigga, reverend
Mr O 10, I get it in, I wear the crown
We the best, tell 'em fuck next, I got downs

[Verse 6: Gunplay]
You got the cash? Then show me, better not be phoney
Get on my level cause they way below me
You ballin? Bologna. Girls ask me what my cologne is
Steel Khakis and Coronas and I'm mackin' a donkey
Flip the 4 and a half, do the vert and a left
Bet the ave never seen banks chunky as that
Why you got pressure? Cause my Impala got pressure
Beating outside, shaking the dice on my dresser. Is that Gunplay, Yes sir

[Verse 7: Rum]
Yes, I'm on my way, all the way to the top, but I comin' from the bottom
You right here ain't go no brain, uh-uh, can't stop 'em
Headin' to the floor, I'm ridin'
Where the money keep most supplyin'
You can tell I'm stickin' like a muthafucker by the way I'm vibing
Just came back from where I was On my way somewhere else next
Lightening wrapped up in around my bankroll make my money spent
You can check up over here, check up over there Spent my hustle everywhere
I'm high-head grinding, getting it I'm everywhere, you're never there

[Verse 8: Young Cash]
It's Young Cash, I rap and I sing, nigga
Still a goon, I rap under you rappers for your chain, nigga
Fuck the alcohol, I'm the one they're playing, nigga
Black is the attire when I roll up with that thing, nigga
I'm riding flow, but I don't wanna move in quarter keys
I come from Texas, if you're Georgia just to fuck with me
Gimme your order, buy them more then, dog, I guarantee
That you gon' leave with some whitest lines ever released to T
