[Hook]
I got homies that'll catch bodies
Started off at that bottom
N now every time that i fuck
Its two hoes that I'm poppin
N now who the fuck want problems?
Point em out an I got em
I can AK or revolve em
Either way it ain't no talking
Cause it all began wit jus a gram
N i stacked that to a brick
You gotta know if i send them goons
Your mattress getting flipped
They gon take it all your money gone
Jus like a magic trick, man my palm
Will mot stop itching gotta have that grip!

[Verse 1 - Matty Raw]

Ayo i gotta have that grip
I been stacking it since a git
I been working my ass off
N i got my chance to go legit
All of my soldiers holding drums
But only a band will get you hit
N all of y'all becoming slaves
While uncle sam is getting rich
But I'm like fuck that, not me
I keep my wrist froze, hockey
I need some good head, sloppy
I like them spanish hoes, mami
Now who that be that?, slidin
That be that Matt Raw!, hidin
Behind that black tint in that black car
With that black chick that like white broads
N all my homies come from the streets
All my homies done been in beef
All my homies done sold drugs
N all my homies done popped a slug
All of us done came up from flipping dope n flippin molly
I already done copped the dodge, I'm tryna whip that rati!!


[Verse 2 - Gunplay]

Im d-boy fresh, 3 corvettes
All shorty wanna do is what a d-boy says
D-boy nikes wit a d-boy check
D-boy ice on a d-boy neck
Black bottle bussa, mack on the dresser
You crack under pressure but crack is my hustle
Compress a kilo come get this perico
Mileage on zero my Benz jus a week old
Coke in the cup, whip wit the fork
Microwave i can make chips n a porsche
Fuck a high fashion barbie
Then crash the rari, I'm rich n reckless
You guessed it, I'm sorry!!
