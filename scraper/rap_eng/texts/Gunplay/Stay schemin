These niggers is not friends, these bitches is all hoes
The police is watchin' me, look at me, front row
Come on, look at me, front row
Come on, look at me, front row
These niggers is not friends, these bitches is all hoes
The police is watchin' me, look at me, front row
Come on, look at me, front row
Come on, look at me, front row
A1 since day one
Man, these niggers had cake, I had to wait crumbs
Fake jersey on, boot leg L1's
Black heart, if you depart I could care not
Spare nothin', self made, why should I share some?
So much I wanna save one pair of lungs
I'm just a skinny pimp, no frail numbers
Schemin' with schemers and a few belt jumpers
I'm thugin' till I motherfuckin' hear trompets
But to then your hear my drum roll brrrrr doppin'
I'm clearly distorted to just a few wussup
True to the game since true and but
These niggers is not friends, these bitches is all hoes
The police is watchin' me, look at me, front row
Come on, look at me, front row
Just look at me, front row
These niggers is not friends, these bitches is all hoes
The police is watchin' me, look at me, front row
Come on, look at me, front row
Come on, look at me, front row
