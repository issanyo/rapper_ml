[Intro: Gunplay]
I just beat a life sentence nigga
Fuck ya'
I just beat a life sentence nigga
Fuck ya'
Bet that
Bet that
Bet that

[Hook: Gunplay] x2
I don't give a fuck about ya, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck about ya, I don't give a fuck
And you can bet that, and you can bet that
You understand?

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
No love for a pussy nigga
No love for the pussy neither
Holler fuck 'em, hope you quit your breathing
I don't gotta make believe, I make believers
This ratchet patching nigga head up something decent
Fuck a precinct and that whip you leasing
My nigga my new stick come equipped with features
And that whole dome come equipped with bleachers, so what's the play?
Spend a stack and whack a nigga bout some loose change
That's the way I act and how I do things
I'm thugging all the time, ain't a mood swing
I'm a human cocaine shoestring

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
These busters been boofs
Full of shit, actin' full clip proof
I don't give a fuck 'bout who you kin to
I got uncles, I got homies in the pen too
My patience wear thin too
I don't give a fuck about you, nothing bout ya
Bitches bring me money that they snuck up out ya
Then tell me, daddy it's just something bout ya
I tell her I don't doubt ya, I'm like nothing outchea
Busting when I wasn't, now the haters hover like
Buzzards over desert, everything I do I gotta overdose to measure
Oh, lord
Look who came to visit, the new O-Dog

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
I don't give a fuck who you are, so fuck who you are
Shout out to Styles P, that's like the hardest fucking bar
I don't give a fuck if you the next rising star
Get star struck and get hit with this A.R
A double M. O., fuck what you saying
Get played like a demo, niggas know my M.O
Money over bitches, God over all
Birthed you little niggas, watched you all crawl
Leanin' on them bricks still, Michael Off the Wall (Hee-hee!)
Don't stop till you get enough of that raw
All we is is get money, running from the law
Think you don't give a fuck? Shit I'mma raise the bar

[Hook]
