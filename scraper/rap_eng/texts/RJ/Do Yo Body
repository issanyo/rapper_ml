[Verse 1:]
I know it’s only 7 O'clock but girl whatever
Just hop in this bed and get your issue
Now girl just spread your legs
And de-flower the bed
For hours we shower then it's round two
And we ain't made it past the steps
Half step then and have to step back
See your waist set settle down that's a setback
We gonna climax and max out
Just expect that
Perfection takes time
When I’m in it that's mine
And I know you feel fulfilled when I fell in it
Them other niggas fell off like pale pivot
Devote my time to making money
Dodging jail sitting
Look, you remind me of my jeep
With panel leather seats, still discreet
Ain’t nobody gonna do you like me
Hennessy got your body belonging to me
Lock and key, once I kill it then it’s RIP
Every week, posting me
Your MCM on IG

[Chorus:]
Ain’t nobody gonna do your body like this
Goddamn
I got you feeling like
Ain’t nobody gon’ do your body like me
Goddamn

[Bridge:]
I got you feeling like nobody gonna do you like me
I got you feeling like nobody can take it from me
I got you feeling like
I got me feeling like
I got you feeling like me

[Chorus]
