[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Bag secured, I only walk through if the cash right
Finest VVses turn my wrist into a flashlight
So even when it's dark out, I see you the hatin' ass type
Divas layin' in my bed, "Let's talk about last night"
This is nothing new to me, I shine without no jewleries
Since 2007, I had hoes who went to school with me
Usin' hall passes, in the bathroom showing nudity
I smack a booty cheek, then head back to class foolishly
I been on some dumb shit way before I went through puberty
Youngster acting stupidly
I took it to a new degree
Labeled as a nuisance in the billionaire community
Checks are in the mail, I see this money stacking beautifully
Upgraded my roster, I'm the GM of the year, ho
If you don't want your lady taken from you, steer clear, bro
All-Star team of birds, you should just be careful
I'm the alpha, when you're in my presence you get fearful
I feel you

[Chorus: Jay Ant & G-Eazy]
I don't know, it just came over me (hey)
I don't know, it just came over me (hey)
My old bitch over me, she want the sober me (hey)
I don't know what possessed this foolery
What's all over me? That's jewlery
That's jewelry, baby
What's all over me? That's jewlery
That's jewelry, baby
Baby, what just came over me?
I don't know, it just came over me

[Verse 2: RJ]
Uneducated know-it-all
I'm chargin' for it, that's the protocol
I bought it worn, like an old revolver
I'm bearin' arms just to throw it off
All this showin' off
Don't know what came over me
I just fucked up a deal for a 40 piece
AV Audi, put some gold ropes up over me
And TV Johnny put some property up in my teeth
How many enemies, without a memory?
I'm still burnin' bridges, ain't no goin' back
House full of bitches spillin' rose in my Cognac
Poverty restrictions got me driven like a Hellcat
All these new additions came from knowing who to subtract
I bust first and changed my social (habits)
Dodged the feds' search, I hid my dope in the casket
Still I keep a choppa in the closest cabinet
I'm possessed, I pull a Ghost West bracket

[Chorus: RJ & G-Eazy]
I don't know, it just came over me (hey)
I don't know, it just came over me (hey)
My old bitch over me, she want the sober me (hey)
I don't know what possessed this foolery
What's all over me? That's jewlery
That's jewelry, baby
What's all over me? That's jewlery
That's jewelry, baby
Baby, what just came over me? (golden)
I don't know, it just came over me

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Yeah, I don't know what just got into me
Hennesey'll be the end of me, this shit'll finish me
I cut her off 'cause she was trippin', actin' finicky
I moved on to Leo's girls, that's why he's gettin' sick of me
Yeah, just a bunch of tom foolery
Pharmacy of drugs stay in my little pocket usually
Illicit substances, I'm lovin' what they do to me (yee)
My body covered all in jewlery
Yeah, I don't know what just came over me
She wants to fuck me right now, I'm like, "Totally"
Mixtape out, you barely poppin' locally
I sell out shows in Switzerland, I do this shit globally
Yeah, success fully might've fucked my head up
I'm drinking Stillhouses by the red cup
I count a million cash, then say, "Bless up"
I'm poppin' right now, fuck a next up (ayy)

[Chorus: RJ & G-Eazy]
I don't know, it just came over me (hey)
I don't know, it just came over me (hey)
My old bitch over me, she want the sober me (hey)
I don't know what possessed this foolery
What's all over me? That's jewlery
That's jewelry, baby
What's all over me? That's jewlery
That's jewelry, baby
Baby, what just came over me? (golden)
I don't know, it just came over me
