[Intro]
RJ
I got so many haters (so many)
Same niggas still own me favors (so many)
Time still like rolling papers (so many)
Throwing 100 on these hoes in Vegas (so many)
At the Drai's (yeah)
I throw a blue face, (yeah), caught a new case, (yeah)
Tie a chopper to my shoulder with a shoelace

[Verse 1]
Said I got the high beams on daytime with them fog lights
I see you haters ain't nothing but catfish at a dog fight
I only been balling for a minute
You been hating me your whole life
You can have her back when I'm finished
I'll be done with her no time
Yeah I got haters, on God thank God for haters
When shit switch up niggas flash true colors like a strobe light
I wrote my whole tape in the wraith
Y'all debating bout a ghost right, nigga is you crazy?

[Hook]
Fuck how you feeling
Cause I'm feeling myself
I got so many haters
They hate I'm feeling myself

[Verse 2]
Its Mr. One and only big homie need a chain and rollie
The young Kobe with the 8 up on me
We got the same 24 what you hate me for
Get off your ass get your own plate to go
Roof top two broads in a leotard
Fighting for the unit when I get the freak award
Shake my G report high [?]
OMMIO the final score niggas riding for it
Woah, I know I talk about it more than average
I got that if I want it grab it savage personality
Got them I ain't never had shit splurging habits
Two thousand for the jacket wear it twice and trash it
Slide through traffic staring eyes attracted
Too active nigga my paradise is gambling
You hating me the government made you broke
You hating on another nigga I just made the most

[Hook]
Fuck how you feeling
Cause I'm feeling myself
I got so many haters
They hate I'm feeling myself
