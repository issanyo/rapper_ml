[Verse 1: Choice]
And you knotted like a dread head
Balling, find a method
Nigga red man bear head
F*cking on the throne make the bear head lean
Rocking lion as a layer on a leer jet
Chiapet nigags green, growing artificially
You’re missing me
Check shot efficiency
Slay top ja vinci tee
Bickity Tucker no Chris for the wrist
How does Al Green grits can’t out style me bitch
The razor and that go on my favourite uncle’s butter
Came out the womb sharp
If I hug her Im gon’ cut her
Gunther dick bumping like a hunter
Team full of special bitches
She not with it, I’m a punt her pooh
And let him bug her like a tap phone
Think its peanut butter on a flat spoon
Ass too outta shape with no stars by your circle
And Ferkle spinning Federal reserve

[Chorus: RJ]
I ain’t gotta f*ck with ya’ll niggas
I don’t
Cause I ain’t never f*ck with ya’ll niggas before
I ain’t gotta f*ck with ya’ll niggas
Bitches got more nuts than niggas
And niggas be moping still btiches these days
F*ck your OP
You ain’t getting me paid
Cause I ain’t gotta f*ck with ya’ll niggas
I ain’t hit blunt with ya’ll niggas
Can’t call to see whats up with ya’ll nigas
Cause I ain’t never really f*cked with ya’ll niggas, niggas

[Verse 2: RJ]
They say RJ you got your nerve
And bitch you getting on my last
Don’t work, you get what you deserve
I’m quick to throw curves
Birds tryna pull fast, okay tell me
Is you friend or foe
How come you jelly
I been dropping my nuts a year ago
Hey bitch I’m barely in flesh yeah I was skin and bones
I had to spread with my celly just to use the phone
I bring life to these tracks Im the line leader
Design sleeve or line eagle
When I’m flying feature
Ty leave your two nines call them barely legal
We ain’t legal, think you sweet
I can die beat you
I’m mafia that’s the rock without the cut on it
I got some crip relatives they my blood cousins
It’s hard to love a motherf*cker who don’t love nothing
Them same niggas jump ship when the flood coming

[Chorus: RJ]
I ain’t gotta f*ck with ya’ll niggas
I don’t
Cause I ain’t never f*ck with ya’ll niggas before
I ain’t gotta f*ck with ya’ll niggas
Bitches got more nuts than niggas
And niggas be moping still btiches these days
F*ck your OP
You ain’t getting me paid
Cause I ain’t gotta f*ck with ya’ll niggas
I ain’t hit blunt with ya’ll niggas
Can’t call to see whats up with ya’ll nigas
Cause I ain’t never really f*cked with ya’ll niggas, niggas

[Verse 3: Leswood]
Coming up with Young G they used to ask what I rap for
I ain’t a combo on that note
I’m all about these bitches
Foreign bitches stamp my passport
I’m swimming in them like  a backstroke
WHo player, you pussies keep pushing your date
Hating all in my comments nigga that shit don’t phase me
Trying to f*ck up some commas, f*ck around have my baby
I can hit raw with my exes like yes, please come save me
They can see it’s coming
Now all that acting and fronting
Like I got the Grammy’s or something
Couldn’t get the grease out the oven, I’m hot
My conscience screaming
Would dodge em and duck em
They only problems so fuck em
Bitch I mean ya’ll got the city on lock
Thought I was the underdog till I showed up
Now it’s looking like I got the name sure enough
I just be close to getting blunted for now
Let’s just see where I’m at here’s something for now


[Chorus: RJ]
I ain’t gotta f*ck with ya’ll niggas
I don’t
Cause I ain’t never f*ck with ya’ll niggas before
I ain’t gotta f*ck with ya’ll niggas
Bitches got more nuts than niggas
And niggas be moping still btiches these days
F*ck your OP
You ain’t getting me paid
Cause I ain’t gotta f*ck with ya’ll niggas
I ain’t hit blunt with ya’ll niggas
Can’t call to see whats up with ya’ll nigas
Cause I ain’t never really f*cked with ya’ll niggas, niggas
