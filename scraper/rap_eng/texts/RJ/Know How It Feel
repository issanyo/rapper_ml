[Verse 1]
You say somethin' better mean that
Before you sign need to read that
Niggas sly for a feedback
Only 'pologetic when the dice crap
Can't take life back
My young nigga got a shit bag
Still with the shit black
Drill with the big bags
How many tips knock off your gut like a six pack
Hold up Imma catch 'em all, throw em' like a Poke Ball
Aim this blower at your body knock a shoulder off
Miss the bank (?)
Hit the bank blow it off
Flippin' all these babies chopper roosters like a foster farm, yeah
Flash the Ruger like a Costco card, yeah
I trap with shooters till the shot clock off, yeah
I'm Ferris Bueller when the cops get called, wait
I'm prolly wake up on the yacht tomorrow, forreal
Just chill, focus on the mils
Is you the type to jeopardize the hoe for the thrill
Never make a wife outta hoe in the field
Long nights with the dope on the scale

[Hook]
I know how it feel
I know how it feel
The ice out my grill
I know how it feel
To ride with that drill
I know how it feel
I know how it feel
I know how it feel
How it feel to be real
I know how it feel (ooou)
I know how it feel (I do)
I know how, I know how it feel

[Post-Hook]
I know, I know, I know, I know
Trouble it pass it comes and goes
I spent the gas that Texaco
My plug it packed from Salvador

[Verse 2]
I know what to do next, yeah
Flippin' money like a suplex
Bullets taggin' whole crew call it group sex
I know how to send it, she know I ain't scripted
She know for a fact I'm the realest she had been with
I don't know these bitches but I know what they intent is
I know if I let her give me top I'm gon' resent it
Calvin Klein draws crotch covered with her lipstick
Man I'm tired of broke hoes
Sick of y'all that's a Doko
Now watch me ball on the GoPro, wait
I be in LA where you don't go, yeah
I still pull up on you, bolo

[Hook]
I know how it feel
I know how it feel
The ice out my grill
I know how it feel
To ride with that drill
I know how it feel
I know how it feel
I know how it feel
How it feel to be real
I know how it feel (ooou)
I know how it feel (hey)
I know how, I know how it feel

[Refrain]
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
Trouble it pass it comes and goes
I spent the gas that Texaco
My plug it packed from Salvador

[Hook]
I know how it feel
I know how it feel
The ice out my grill
I know how it feel
To ride with that drill
I know how it feel
I know how it feel
I know how it feel
How it feel to be real
I know how it feel (ooou)
I know how it feel (hey)
I know how, I know how it feel
