[Verse 1: Skeme]
Still keep the pistol and never switched over
Yellow boogers in the watch like I pissed on 'em
Nuts hanging cause a young nigga been swinging
Bet my last dollar that your bitch wanna kiss on 'em
I'm the only nigga I can call on, so I keep my own phone number in my other phone
I'm a stingy ass nigga when it come to pussy
If I'm a claim her I'm the only one she fucking on
Woo, two hundred dash, got a lot of cash
Still smash, play with me I'll get your body bag
They gonna have to call the coroner for toe tags
Tell the bank tellers tell a nigga where them O's at

[Hook: Skeme]
I got rich nigga issues, I got rich nigga issues
They always hating on a real nigga
Well fuck you and every nigga came with you (2X)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
It's the King!
Man I promise I just, scratched my brand new Bentley pulling up to my jet
If that ain't bad enough I just picked up a hundred racks
Overseas tryna figure how the fuck I get it back
Quarter million dollars on a crap game, get a hundred million out the rap game
Tryna make a billion before I'm forty and they love me in the bay because I keep it real E-40
What's the deal, on doe, on phil, on chamille I'm a stack enough to get Cap out of jail
Keep it real, the trap is all I ever do, all we do is get that dough until we die that fuck is you doing
Probably beefing on the Internet, ain't finna play with these ho niggas I'm too rich for that
They get back in that bitch nigga section, they seen a bad day sitting when I had ye
I'm the shit man

[Hook: Skeme]

[Verse 3: RJ]
Ooh, had dope in a tissue, I sold coke off the brick ooh
Young blood nigga went to crip schools
Big move, got it off the dock like a script ooh
I won't let these rumors get the best of me
Separate the streets from this rap money
My name getting bigger by the ticket
Got my foot in the door same day I got evicted
Different, driven by money and ambition
And let me tell me cross over and transition
Look bitches won't let me pull out the pipe now
Left it in the condom I see future in this lifestyle
More money more issues, still send a white bitch when the rent due
Look everybody focused on my life
I just bet another band on the dice nigga fuck your advice
