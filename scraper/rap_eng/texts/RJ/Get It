He’s slacking on my pimping
I ain’t losing, I’m winning
Nigga, this your bitch I’m flipping
We stunting up and now watching her body get it

[Verse 1: RJ]
Annie what you really saying
Getting money
I can afford to be a minute man
Specially when you go around like a ceiling fan
But I don’t care, I don’t care, I just had to put it out there
Out there, they call me Mr. Bitches, this sounds like riches
I’ll take it, fuck you from long distance
Heard you got baggage, the baby daddy be tripping
He fell in love with a freak, insecure ways, try to keep you on a leash
I got a lot of fame from Been From The Gang
Hoes never seen my face but they screaming my name
RJ, On my momma I’m on
On my momma I’m on
Your man slacking, put her pants on a plaster
Judge a book by its chapters

[Verse 2: TeeFLii]
Annie want the crown
So I make her Run It like Chris Brown
Oh, no, yeah, I said it
Wait, huh, yeah, I said it
We starting, have her burning
On the pole she a pro, she be working
Yeah, she with a fat ass
She rock a fella like Damon Dash
Splash in that cooter cooter
She let a nigga bare back
Boy look here, yo, Annie, over here
She shading on other hoes, she gonna pop it for me
For me, for me, Annie
