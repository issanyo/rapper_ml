[Verse 1: Rillo$]
I came a long ass way and I ain't going back
You place bets on yourself when you know you dat
Full clip in the nina where the boulders at
The road rocky up ahead but you ain't on the map
Of this im to sure
Im not the same as before
I bring that thang to your door
Turnin the bank to a store
Hit pussy drapped in Cotoure
Ali spend bank on the tour
Said its 9 O’s nigga get ya team straight
We be runnin this shit like a relay
I been gettin money bac like a rebate
Bitch I play for first place like a sweepstakes told 'em I

[Chorus: Rillo$]
I run it, I run it
Redbone bitches blue hundreds nigga
Chillin' on the block with two gunners nigga
Paid my dues, I'm runnin' up the niggas
I run it, I run it
Redbone bitches blue hundreds nigga
Chillin' on the block with two gunners nigga
Paid my dues, I'm runnin' up the niggas

[Verse 2: RJ]
It ain’t hard to see we run it, run it, run it
Badbone bathroom fuccin says she can fill it in her stomach, stomach, stomach
Wraps on peeling blue hundreds, runnin numbers on em
Ommio Four Hundred summers on em
Tearing up the mall with my women, money whoa
Redrum champagne bubbles on em,  oh
Two twin pipes, got a porno commin, oh
Fuccin up the streets like construction workers, I
Flippin ends meet and I ain't cooking burgers whoa
Enemies see me commin and all my enmies be runnin cause I run it

[Chorus: Rillo$]
I run it, I run it
Redbone bitches blue hundreds nigga
Chillin' on the block with two gunners nigga
Paid my dues, I'm runnin' up the niggas
I run it, I run it
Redbone bitches blue hundreds nigga
Chillin' on the block with two gunners nigga
Paid my dues, I'm runnin' up the niggas
