[Chorus: IamSu!]
Top down in the wind
Me and my niggas for the win
I need a bank account full of M's
Cheap talk don’t spend
Cause it ain’t no talking
Ain’t no conversation
Nothing left to talk about
If it ain’t bout that, it ain’t bout that
Money, money, money


[Verse 1: Rj]
I’m solely committed, this ain’t just a phase
Still fall in that thing with that thing on my waist
So rippings no issue, a fade is a fade
From LA to the A, you gon’ dodge or be brave
Niggas on that 9 turn an F to a Benz
Never say never, say where I say when
You ain’t making bread if you ain’t losing friends
I came up on that weight, lost that like a cleanse
Jump off, they jump on
I say jump on she fade away
Hey when she come down I count up what she made today
I got pulled over man I’ve got that burner
I’m glad them prince ain’t come back with that murder
I ain’t saying no word man
I was just observing my options
No swerving not stopping, no top like she’s stripping


[Chorus: IamSu!]
Top down in the wind
Me and my niggas for the win
I need a bank account full of M's
Cheap talk don’t spend
Cause it ain’t no talking
Ain’t no conversation
Nothing left to talk about
If it ain’t bout that, it ain’t bout that
Money, money, money


[Verse 2: Skeme]
You ain’t getting money don’t talk to me
Cash out got a lot of niggas talk funny
Bitch I ain’t never been in the running
Fifty bands on me now
New hunnies make me walk funny
Road to the richies is a race, I put me in front
I can’t stop till I get everything, I need one
Boss man sagging for the ‘copter and the captain
Only way I am riding on the bitch wagon
If the bitch got a J in front
Chase, chase all day, still ain’t broke a sweat
Only action round me is get right or get left
I’mma be off in some pussy before I be in debt
I’m so up, can’t even get upset


[Chorus: IamSu!]
Top down in the wind
Me and my niggas for the win
I need a bank account full of M's
Cheap talk don’t spend
Cause it ain’t no talking
Ain’t no conversation
Nothing left to talk about
If it ain’t bout that, it ain’t bout that
Money, money, money
