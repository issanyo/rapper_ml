[Verse 1: RJ]
Your body, all over
You want it, come closer
Sweet kisses, down lower
Just let love, take over

[Chorus]
Ill be right here waiting for ya (Oh... Oh..)
We don't have to rush no we can take our time
Cause ill be right here waiting for ya (Oh... Oh..)
We don't have to rush no we can take our time


[Verse 2: RJ]
There is something special about when two become one
We can take our time and make love till the morning comes

[Verse 3: RJ]
Let rain drops, fall over
Temptation, is coming
Your body, sweet Jesus
So sexy, I need it, I need it (Oh.. Oh.. Yea.. Yea)

[Chorus]
Ill be right here waiting for ya (Oh... Oh..)
We don't have to rush no we can take our time
Cause ill be right here waiting for ya (Oh... Oh..)
We don't have to rush no we can take our time

[Pre Chorus]
Gimme that(x6) (If you wanna)
(ill be waiting) Waiting for ya (Oh yea)
We... can... take... our time
Gimme that(x6) Waiting for ya (Waiting for you)
We can take...

[Chorus]
Said ill be right here waiting for ya (Oh... Oh..)
We don't have to rush no we can take our time
Cause ill be right here waiting for ya (Oh... Oh..)
We don't have to rush no we can take our time
