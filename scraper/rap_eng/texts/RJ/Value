[Verse 1:]
I spend alot of out of out of town for you
A panorama view
To capture you and all your attributes
To get it counted when it’s needed (oh)
I’ve been up and down and out for you
I lost and found a few
We been through worse, I never doubted you
You take my ego and you feed it (you feed it)
Gotta wash that car, it’s a Nissan
Deja vu like a rerun
So many episodes I’m seasoned
These winners don’t freeze up
We often value what we need most
You still find Jacksons without Tito
My ego has gotten bigger
The more I ball
Like an eagle catching flights and missing calls
Both sides done played our parts
But our bloodline is flowing through these scars
We done been through it all but

[Chorus:]
No matter all the fights we got into
It wouldn’t be life without you
I’ve been out so many nights without you
I paid the price to prove I got you
Show you that I value you, you
I just want to prove I value you, you

[Verse 2:]
Man this shit could be ours with Y on it
Cake with ice on it
Go together like Patron and pry hold it down
Not chase you till your core caught up
They fell not us
Thrown to the ground, caught us
Ballers with your Mille watches
They watch us
Shop for LA casa blow, fish pasta
With basslets in the head rest
Sick of your last nigga come and bedrest
With your tan best friend who looks like Cassie
Nigga wanna join and know Jackie
Run my name so much she bout to lap me
Vampire nails up my back, deep
Drug in my sack sheet
Here as a plus, never minus
These niggas want your brain
And I want what’s inside it
Got hoes but your valueoru’s the highest
Love and power provide it
They bow to Your Highness

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Show you that I value you, you
I just want to prove I value you, you
Show you that I value you, you
I just want to prove I value you, you

[Chorus]
