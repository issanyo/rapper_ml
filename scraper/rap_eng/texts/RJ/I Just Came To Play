[Verse 1:]
Devil’s playground and we just in here smoking
Pass the vape round
Playing with a cheque like Nike time
Starting with my dogs on the grey hair
Hey I’ve been watching everybody
Looking at me, looking like what you motherf*ckers looking at
Okay so much p*ssy thrown, it come with a chair man
I can’t f*ck you hoes, you don’t fix your edges
Osbourne late night last night
I know you wanna get hit
You should act like it
I can spot a snake nigga
No matter the grass height
Rolling face flashlight
Scratch without a cat fight
Broke out the huddle
Broke you of with no endorsements
Never thought I would see court from these flossies
Being broke hurt too bad, I need morphine
But these childish bitches need some car seat

[Chorus:]
Man these broads keep staring at the rolex
It could be your hoe next
Ball like a short stack
I just came to play [x3]
Ball like a short sack
I just came to play

[Verse 2:]
She cute but she stay on some circus shit
Papa said son, keep a stiffer upper lip
And that mean don’t show emotion in this f*cking shit
Man I had a hundred bitches with a hundred cent
Now I’m seeing a hundred thousand, you ain’t trying to fuck and shit
Bye there, fuck miss right
I need miss right here
Rich off the function, not construction
Nigga trying to brush in
The fifty cal crumping, okay
First fuck the game, make the cash come
She skinny with the swag but her sister got the ass huh
Your new one is my last one
Set a bag of bananas in the sun
You would still have a bad one
Not a house of Dereon, bitches vary on
That go for everyone, if I can’t bag free then carry on
Got the spine guy head untied
Cause p*ssy get old like bread, not wine nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Ain’t feeling all these bitches they wanna follow me
It’s ten summers got 2016 already locked
We from the block on the block
We will never stop
And that’s hoe green dot
When the cash slow
White girl in the back smelling like a brick
Don’t get confused if you trip, you get the whole clip
I came to play like Michael Jordan back in 96
Hella options like a college team
Dreams big, can’t even fit in a colosseum
Done dummy your foreigns, funny you look bummy
I will not lie your baby momma
Steady looking for me
I do not hesitate I get fly then I levitate
Ice is face on my wrist
Call it pound cake
RJ pump fake tell them take a break
We got choices, we live and learning from our mistakes
But it don’t matter what they buying I’mma celebrate

[Chorus]
