Baby it’s the last time, I ever fall in love
Even though I’ve said enough
I wanna hold on to, if love is true
Like we never did before
It’s the last time I fall in love
Even though the heavens above
I wanna hold on to, if love is true
Like we never did before, before, before, before, before
Baby it’s the last time, time, time, time, time, time

One more night, so deep in the heart
Just music, dance in the dark
One more night, hot fire, you’re playing my mind
All of the desire
I can’t get down inside, the love and the pain
Don’t be such a liar, every time we fight
Hurting us 2
I can’t stop with the loving you

Baby it’s the last time, I ever fall in love
Even though I’ve said enough
It’s the last time I fall in love
Baby it’s the last time

Flo Rida

But nigga…that Gucci … getting paid
… I ain’t never …will never, …
Ain’t no time, I am living …
Now I don’t worry…

I met her at the bowl, we had …I wasted
3 … on her, we would…
…one night, this girl out in London, this girl out in London
London, London, London, London, London
