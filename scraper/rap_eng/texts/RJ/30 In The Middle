[Verse 1:]
Uh
We been getting no sleep
That's why my neck feels like the nose bleeds
I get respect where they should dome me
My section be OD
Homosexual bitches wanna blow me
Skip the lectures gotta show me
Demonstrate the old me
Detrimental all you new niggas
I split the middle hit your crew member
You knew better you do better
I showed your bitch I'm on a new level
I reinvent you make a new letter
She told me I was suicide
If she fuck me she could lose her life
Said her husband got them Jewish ties
I got a shooters eye
In the trenches with the roof reclined
Nailing bitches leave 'em crucified

[Hook:]
Riding 'round with thirty-thousand dollars in my middle counsel
Riding 'round with thirty-thousand dollars in my middle counsel
I been riding 'round with thirty-thousand dollars in my middle counsel
(I ain't playing with it
Why you playing with it
Niggas riding with the chopper I ain't playing with it
I ain't playing with it I ain't playing with it)
Riding 'round with thirty-thousand dollars in my middle counsel
(Niggas try me on God I ain't playing with 'em)

[Verse 2:]
Whenever my phone ring
It could be Lams or it's codeine
And Sunset J I just bought fourteen
We gone hit the road deep
Casa to Seattle
Say it's hard to have no feelings
I fuck her like she matter
I fuck her like she matter I get bored and start ignoring her
Known to kill the pussy
Lay her out and call the coroner
Gangsters never die they just move inside of Florida
Double homicide
Suicide Lambo doors go up
I don't talk to promoters
I just show up and get dollars
I pull up with parolees
Police already know us
Was 'posed to make a deposit the bank already had closed
Fuck it I let these choppers and shotgun ride home until the morn

[Hook:]
Riding 'round with thirty-thousand dollars in my middle counsel
(I'll blow this bitch tonight while you playing with it)
Riding 'round with thirty-thousand dollars in my middle counsel
(What you niggas want the mud or the drugs nigga?)
I been riding 'round with thirty-thousand dollars in my middle counsel
(Niggas riding with the chopper I ain't playing with it, I ain't playing with it, I ain't playing with it)
Riding 'round with thirty-thousand dollars in my middle counsel
(Niggas try me on God I ain't playing with 'em)

[Bridge:]
I ain't playing with it
Why you playing with it
I'll blow this bitch tonight while you playing with it
I ain't playing with it
Niggas playing with it
What you niggas want the mud or the drugs nigga?
I ain't playing with it
Why you playing with it
Niggas riding with the chopper I ain't playing with it
I ain't playing with it
I ain't playing with it
Niggas try me on God I ain't playing with 'em

[Hook:]
Riding 'round with thirty-thousand dollars in my middle counsel
(I'll blow this bitch tonight while you playing with it)
Riding 'round with thirty-thousand dollars in my middle counsel
(What you niggas want the mud or the drugs nigga?)
I been riding 'round with thirty-thousand dollars in my middle counsel
(Niggas riding with the chopper I ain't playing with it, I ain't playing with it, I ain't playing with it)
Riding 'round with thirty-thousand dollars in my middle counsel
(Niggas try me on God I ain't playing with 'em)
