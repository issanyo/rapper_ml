[Verse 1: RJ]
If you really want me
Then why don't you show me?
That you really need me in this way?
If you really hold me
If you really touch me
I know I can live for, and die for each day
I live for each day!

[Pre-Hook: RJ]
If you really wanna love someone
Would you really wanna live alone?
You gotta be strong to belong inside!
If you wanna feel like everyone
If you wanna go to ever long
'Cause I can live for, and die for each day
I wanna live for today!

[Hook: RJ]
I'm gonna live for, and live for love
I'm gonna die for, die for love
Listen to my heart and what it says
In your arms I could love this way
Live for, and die for each day!

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
See, I'm new to the game
You're living like plastic box, you're married to Jane
You're getting buried today, so get the casket
And better Ready to make sure the suit are black
I don't care what it takes
Question is what the shoe when he passes
See I'm in the game
But at the same time try to stay out the game

[Verse 3: RJ]
You can only give to
When you know you've gone through
The answer speaks to love
Here I wanna be true
Love is reborn in you
I know I can live for and die for each day!
I live for each day

[Pre-Hook: RJ]
If you wanna feel like everyone
If you wanna go to ever long
'Cause I can live for, and die for each day
I wanna live for today!

[Hook: RJ]
I'm gonna live for, and live for love (I'm gonna live, I'm gonna live)
I'm gonna die for, die for love (I'm gonna die, die)
Only a love can show me the way (show me the way)
Counting on you, on you to stay (on you to stay)
Live for, and die for each day!

[Outro: RJ]
If you really want me
Then why don't you show me?
That you really need me in this way?
