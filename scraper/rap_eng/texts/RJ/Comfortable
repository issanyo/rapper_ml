[Intro]
On Gooooood!
Mustard on the beat hoe!

[Verse 1]
All this arguin'
Bitch did you forget who car you in
I know you tired of all this fussin'
Cause all this fightin' ain't change nothin'
You end up cryin' over assumptions
I'm out here grindin' hundreds to hundreds
I brought the 9 even though this shit a felon
You put it in your purse and you say you ain't tellin
Hoes hittin' my line, lined up around the Bentley
You be gettin' outta line all up in your feelings
I ain't feelin' these thirsty hoes
But who the fuck is you cursin' hoe

[Hook]
I can't believe all this love you thought
I think you just comfortable
We fight then we fuck, then we fight then we fuck some more
Don't know what we fussin' for
You leavin' but you gon' come back for these hunnids tho
One hunnid
You gon' be back for these hunnids tho
One hunnid, keep it one hunnnid


[Verse 2]
All around town lookin' upset
Really you just mad we ain't fucked yet
Gettin' paranoid doin' phone checks
Ooh that sound personal
Dickmatized women are worst than hoes
I bought the 9 even though this shit a felon
You put it in your purse and you say you ain't tellin
Hoes hittin' my line, lined up around the Bentley
You be gettin' outta line all up in your feelings
I ain't feelin' these thirsty hoes, hold up
Who the fuck is you cursin' hoe? I know, not me

[Hook]
I can't believe all this love you thought
I think you just comfortable
We fight then we fuck, then we fight then we fuck some more
Don't know what we fussin' for
You leavin' but you gon' come back for these hunnids tho
One hunnid
You gon' be back for these hunnids tho
One hunnid, keep it one hunnnid

[Bridge]
I love you tho (I love you tho)
I don't believe all this all this love you thought
(I don't believe it come out of your heels and you ride on my bed and you)
Comfortable (Comfortable aw no you so)
Comfortable (we break up, we make up, we wake up and bake up)

[Hook]
I can't believe all this love you thought
I think you just comfortable
We fight then we fuck, then we fight then we fuck some more
Don't know what we fussin' for
You leavin' but you gon' come back for these hunnids tho
One hunnid
You gon' be back for these hunnids tho
One hunnid, keep it one hunnnid
