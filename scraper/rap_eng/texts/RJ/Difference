[Verse 1:]
I’m not searching for love
We ain't searching for love
You feel different, you feel different

[Chorus:]
F*ck her, falling in love
I be falling out of bed, getting head
Tell them other bitches fall through
Trying to holler out rape cause you think I’m getting cake
I’mma put it on tape, f*ck a lawsuit
I got low expectations for bitches
Cause bitches is bitches
They do what they do
Any niggas know different from bitching fall instant
They feelings be getting involved too
Ain’t enough time in the day
No time for a date let me dominate you
I know it’s a tame and a place
‘Fore the time go to waste
I can compensate you
Cause I ain't searching for love (for love)
And we way past the first base (first base)
I start off fast then slow up

[Chorus:]
Don’t it feel different
I know it feel different
Cause I do it way different
Don’t it feel different
I know it feel different
Cause I do it way different
Oh feel the difference
Cause I do it way different
You can feel the difference
Don't it feel different

[Verse 2:]
Let me guide it and silence your mind
And your body combined
It’s your private desires
You can't fight it, that's how I designed it
Them feelings you hiding, I get you excited
Dont get too excited your truth is misguided
You do what's decided
For you I’m a tyrant
Proof is provided, my roof is divided
My roof is discarded
Introduce you to shottas
F*ck all your logic I’m burr
Niggas is softer, ain’t silent they nur
She was just turnt cock the dial on her purse
She wanted it first till it started to hurt
This is what I learnt
I ain’t searching for love
Cause we way past the first base
I start off fast then slow up

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Don’t it feel different
(Ooh feel the difference)
(Cause I do it way different)
