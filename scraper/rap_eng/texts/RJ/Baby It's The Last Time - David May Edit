Baby it's the last time, we ever fall in love
Even though I said enough
I wanna hold on to, if love is true
Like we never did before
It's the last time I fall in love
Even though the heavens above
I wanna hold on to, if love is true
Like we never did before, before, before, before, before…

Baby it's the last time, time, time, time, time, time…

One long night, so deep in my heart
Just music, dance in the dark
One long night, hot fire
You're playing my mind, all of the desire
Girl I can't keep it down inside, the love and the pain
Don't be such a liar, every time we fight
Hurting us two
I can't stop really loving you

Baby it's the last time, I ever fall in love
Even though I said enough
It's the last time I fall in love
Baby it's the last time

One long night, so deep in my heart
Just music, dance in the dark
One long night, hot fire
You're playing my mind, all of the desire
Well I can't keep it down inside, the love and the pain
Don't be such a liar, every time we fight
Hurting us two
I can't stop really loving you

I met her at the bar, we had drinks and got wasted
Sent her straight to her car, we would start soon there kissing
Told you bout my one night, with this girl out in London
This girl out in London, London, London

Baby it's the last time, I ever fall in love
Even though I said enough
It's the last time I fall in love
Baby it's the last time

Baby it's the last time, baby it's the last time
Baby it's the last time
