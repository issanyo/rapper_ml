[Intro: Nef The Pharaoh]
I'm gettin' money, but I want more
I, you a hundred? Here's one more
I, I be on go when it's go time
Get her out them clothes like no time

[Hook: RJ]
I could throw some money for a long damn time
Watch me throw these hundreds for a long ass time
Valet keep it runnin' for a long ass time
I'ma fuck your woman for a long ass time
Go a long ass time
I done been goin' a long ass time
How am I goin', long ass time
How am I goin', long ass time
The choppa go a long ass time

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharoah]
I'm the most steady on the go, I'm a pimp if you a ho
Talk baseball, these other niggas switchin' on the low
Me and 20 both was leanin' on a plane, no dro
Caught a 9 and woke up in your city smokin' dope
I done came up from a comedown
All my day one niggas still around
Yellin' free my dogs, nigga send the pound
Gotta prove a point to make my city proud
Now I could throw this money all day and fuck these bitches all day
But I'd rather trap hard and get it in the hallway
Dreads matted in my head like a Haitian
Face tatted up, swear my mama's friends hate me
Sexual assault, pull up a beat and watch me rape it
Loungin' and relaxin', chillin' in them Bape Asics
Niggas gotta be shittin' me, style took [?]
I am the epitome of big, you're a little league
Pop the clutch, do a wheelie on a 6 speed
Kenny Powers, pull them bitches off the jetski
Fresh nigga, girl, I could take you to sight see
Put some brrs on your wrist and have you icy

[Hook: RJ]
I could throw some money for a long damn time
Watch me throw these hundreds for a long ass time
Valet keep it runnin' for a long ass time
I'ma fuck your woman for a long ass time
Go a long ass time
I done been goin' a long ass time
How am I goin', long ass time
How am I goin', long ass time
The choppa go a long ass time

[Verse 2: RJ]
You know them thangs gon' go brrat-tat-tat, brrat-tat-tat
Y'all don't really rap like that, you act like that
We be really strapped like that, matte black MAC
Matte black Jeep, boy you ain't even s'posed to mack like that
I'ma let these hundreds blow a long time
Can't afford to miss no shows when it's go time
Watch a nigga call these shots without a phone line
And my partner wear a choppa like a 4-5, oh my
Retaliation lit the block like it's daylight
Make sure everybody see it like a cage fight
You niggas still ain't hittin' shit and we don't play fight
We tore up Sams and AOD on the same night
Hey, let 'em go, let them hundreds free
Got 'em out the mud, had to learn how to run in cleats
Raf Simons boots, but I swear they're just too buff for me
Reluctantly, I got 'em just to have him
Had to grab 'em, I just ran 'em, yeah a long way
Where I'm from they taught me watch for what they don't say
Yeah most these niggas actin' hard, they love to roleplay
Yeah I can see who's next in line, but that's a long way

[Hook: RJ]
I could throw some money for a long damn time
Watch me throw these hundreds for a long ass time
Valet keep it runnin' for a long ass time
I'ma fuck your woman for a long ass time
Go a long ass time
I done been goin' a long ass time
How am I goin', long ass time
How am I goin', long ass time
The choppa go a long ass time
