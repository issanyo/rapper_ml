[Verse 1]
Ayy, uh
If you want to, you could let me coach you
Niggas show the most interest when they want you
I was born in the 80's so I'm old school
Had a trap phone 'fore I used a pro tool
Had a backbone 'fore I had a go to
And this Mac on me never hit the coat room
Bitches approachin' me, to hope for me but I'on' breathe back
But you can't get close to me, you 'posed to be like three feet back
Ayy, now all 'a sudden you want me, yeah
How bad? Come show me, yeah
I'm in my bag like groceries, yeah
And bare back like Yogi, yeah, yeah
Bitches be mad on they phone and they bad in the room
Tryna tag all they hoe girls but I blocked 'em too
On behalf of my savages, I remain true to the game
Niggas hatin' on juice

[Hook]
All these hoes on my left, and my right side
These pretty bitches where they 'posed to be?
On my left, and my right side
I keep a heater right next to me
On my left, and my right side
Keep a feeder right close to me
On my left, and my right side
These bad bitches where they 'posed to be?
On my left, my right, my left, right, left
On my left, and my right side
Hey, hey
On my left

[Verse 2]
And I write what I left off
The fast money comin', that's jet talk
A ghetto rich nigga like Jethro
I let my cut throat niggas take your neck off
Still here representin' out the West Coast, yeah
Lettin' birds go like a pet coat, yeah
MrLA with the rare flow, yeah
A black dusty rose, had the male bowls
I done had to eyeball the work when the scale broke
I done got too high, snortin' for the earlobe
Roll it outta [?], tucked in my Guess coat
But it's still for sure money up in Escrow
On my left (my left), my right (my right)
Watch your step, you step, I slide
On my hip, my take, my 9
Yeah on sight, my crime, my time

[Hook]
Just watch my left, and my right side
These pretty bitches where they 'posed to be?
On my left, and my right side
I keep a heater right next to me
On my left, and my right side
Keep a feeder right close to me
On my left, and my right side
These bad bitches where they 'posed to be?
On my left, my right, my left, right, left
On my left, and my right side
Hey, hey
On my left
