[Verse 1:]
Send the ki up in the sky
I gotta let a bird fly
Stay with your man, you ain’t gotta choose sides
Never tell my left hand what I’m doing with my right
Beach full of sand, why I gotta bring mine
Left my girl at the crib, brought my pistol instead
Rumors getting spread say I’m pissing with the Feds
But I don’t run around with the shit that I hear
Rolling with the crown and I’m taken over here
You be tricking on them thots
I should pick em out the flocks
Put your rent up on this Glock
With that rental like a yacht
Olay fukusuah
She gonna pop it for a knot
Since you’re dying for attention
Suicide

[Chorus :]
Man I got a lot of bitches
Lot of bitches (oh God)
I swear I’m getting tired of bitches (tired of bitches
So I

[Chorus :]
Send the ki up in the sky
I gotta let a bird fly
I’d rather spend money, girl I don’t spend time
Every entree got something on the side
You can slide or you can stay
It’s whatever you decide
Oh God, I give no fuck
Hoes come easy
(Yeah)

[Verse 2:]
I let a bird fly before I let her stay the night
She on standby for a red eye flight
I don’t really care
They come a dozen by the dime
Say it ain’t about money, everybody’s got a price
I’m just getting this bread
Counting this bread
Fucking spending this bread
Cause we getting more bread
You ain’t gotta stick around
Baby, there go the door
But don’t try to come around when you need more dough
Niggas tricking on them thots
We should pick em out the flocks
Put your rent up on this Glock
With that rental like a yacht
Ooh they flip and flop
She gonna pop it for a knot
SInce you’re dying for attention
Suicide

[Chorus 1:]
Man I get a lot of bitches (lot of bitches)
So much I gotta retire bitches (tire bitches)

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge:]
Caught my real one, one han dan
Miss one okay, catch another one
I am real one, one han dan
Caught my real one, one han dan
Miss one okay, catch another one
I am a real one, one han dan
So I

[Chorus 2]
Send the ki up in the sky
I gotta let a bird fly
I’d rather spend money girl
I don’t spend time
Every entre got something on the side
You can slide or you can stay
It’s whatever you decide all night
I give no fuck
Hoes come easy
(Yeah)
