[Verse 1: RJ]
I'm doing what I want, I'm catching flights
I'm getting high and catching bitches
This the type of shit you gotta get on
And tell me why, I, I
I got your girl in my ride
Ah, ah, ah, she wonder why
I-I-I'm in and out of her life
Okay you [?] but besides that
These back to back contracts get me sidetracked
It's only whips and small talk in this cartel
We dog a bitch and throw the pussy in the yard sale
We spent it all up at once, get it back in a week
I know you wanna fuck, I'm a fan of the freak
Just roll another blunt [?] Xan in the drink
If you ain't number one, you the jam of the week
Hold on

[Hook: RJ]
The money calling (I'm getting it)
You can call it (none of your business)
How you call it (too much money on the line)
But I'll call you back (look bitch, I'm busy)
The money calling (I'm getting it)
You can call it (none of your business)
How you call it (too much money on the line)
But I'll call you back (look bitch, I'm busy)

[Verse 2: Choice]
Ain't nobody fuck me better
Want your body, not like I need this cake
How can you not see the signs when you're horoscoping
But I don't want no thotty in a Ford Focus
Couldn't afford no one, now I'm making Chevrolet
And you get milk like Special K, nigga, never [?]
I just wanna beat like Timberland's in the lab
In to that [?] who hitting that
Everything I do is write, without a pen and pad
Tonights live whore taking the same nigga back
Got a nigga mad, take her out the country
I woulda changed [?] but her name not money
Is [?] never home [?]
Got a dollar or a [?]
I can find you when I'm forty, bitch

[Hook: RJ]
The money calling (I'm getting it)
You can call it (none of your business)
How you call it (too much money on the line)
But I'll call you back (look bitch, I'm busy)
The money calling (I'm getting it)
You can call it (none of your business)
How you call it (too much money on the line)
But I'll call you back (look bitch, I'm busy)

[Outro: RJ]
I'm not meant to love you
I want your dollars and your drink
But if not I got nothing for you
I may not be perfect
But one thing about you that I'll need
Ain't no purpose

[Hook: RJ]
The money calling (I'm getting it)
You can call it (none of your business)
How you call it (too much money on the line)
But I'll call you back (look bitch, I'm busy)
The money calling (I'm getting it)
You can call it (none of your business)
How you call it (too much money on the line)
But I'll call you back (look bitch, I'm busy)
