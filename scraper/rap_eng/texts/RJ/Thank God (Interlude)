[Verse 1: Big TC]
All my life, once say they love you, want to make you cry
Said they'd never leave, oh how they've lied
Gave up my loyalty and paid the price
Got me asking why these people wrong you, but you done them right
They giving up and all you do is fight
You sacrifice and you would even die
And I thank God for never leaving me alone even when I'm on my own
Won't break, I'm standing strong
And I thank God for showing the road to go
When I'm weak and feeling low, built tough, but never show

[Verse 2: RJ]
Sorry, Ms. Jackson, I hate to call in this fashion
I understand it's late and you work harder than average
Plus I'm knowing that you and your son have been clashing
But Keenon called and told me to tell you what happened
He hit a lick with his homies, his homies switched it on him
They spent the money, he got greedy and put the pistol on him
Shots fired from both sides, but nobody died
I thank God he survived and got out alive
But this gon' hurt you to hear
Keenon went to jail, might be facing some years
Police say it's evidence he broke into someone's residence
The neighbors say they witnessed it and plus they found fingerprints
They say the bail like 50 thou
But it's gon' be like 5 thousand to get him out
Man, I told him not to fuck with them niggas
I'm sorry, I don't mean to curse, but I just never trust 'em at all
And he up in the pound, my dawg
And his girl ain't accepting his call
Can't let him fight the charge in his cell, he didn't bail on me
I got 2, we just need the other 3, fight the case on his feet
