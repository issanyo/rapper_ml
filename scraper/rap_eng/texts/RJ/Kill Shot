[Verse 1:]
Uh
We taking shots to the head
Hey that's that gennity drop
Hold on to what we conversing
If that shoe don't fit with a sock
I'm talking sex in a spot
Get that shit wet while it's hot
Yeah that's that earthquake weather
I need that earthquake shake shake
Hit that boarder like a yacht
Touch your pearl harbor 'til it rock
Wait 'til it all soak like a mop
Then I get in them doors and turn the lock
Hey you gone love me in the box
Like how they categorize rappers
I say this little talk is cheap
I spend more money buying pampers okay

[Bridge:]
Now I can tell the difference from a distance
You choose your sides and blame me for your decision
Open up your thighs
I got you cooking
Now give me some appreciation pussy
I appreciate this pussy

[Hook:]
Show me you love me
You gotta show me you love me
Show me you appreciate me
Show me you love me
You gotta show me you love me
Show me it's a kill shot
Show me you love me
You gotta show me you love me
Show me you appreciate me
Show me you love me
You gotta show me you love me
Show me it's a kill shot
Show me you love me
You gotta show me you love me
Show me you appreciate me
Show me you love me
Ay


[Bridge:]
Look cause I can tell the difference from a distance
You choose your sides and blame me for your decision
Open up your thighs
I got you cooking
Now give me some appreciation pussy
I appreciate this pussy

[Hook:]
Show me you love me
You gotta show me you love me
Show me you appreciate me
Show me you love me
You gotta show me you love me
Uh

[Verse 2:]
These niggas got goofy intentions
But you just too independent
We taking shots to the head
I'm known to shoot with precision
I'm here for better forever
Difference is seen from a distance
I drop my top on the way up
I'm making rootless decisions
I make no room for these bitches
Tay4 in a room full of bitches
These niggas soft as they sisters
Its like I'm roomin' with bitches
They try to move in our business
We got no room for new tenants
They wasn't here from beginning
But want they name on attendance
So this a kill shot
