Eating cause o’ this, eating cause o’ this, eating cause o’ this
Aye look how many niggas eating cause o’ this
Eting cause o’ this, eating cause o’ this, hold on

If you ain’t eating you should pick which dish
Beggars can’t be choosers, gotta get it how you live
I know I pay a big percentage of the bill

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Ah, hold up
Now we just popped off some shrimps
Got this locked don’t resist
With that drop like a brick, I might slide, I don’t slip
Watch what you lip, you get chopped up and zipped
I cover my tracks when I weave out your crib
Feast with my homies, we eat with no beef
Bitch why you owe me can’t breathe with no air
No air, can’t breathe with no air
Bitch why you owe me can’t breathe with no air

Oh get out my way these real fans wanna meet greet
Forty on my waist got it tucked like a cheap sheet
