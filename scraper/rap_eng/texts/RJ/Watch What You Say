[Verse 1]
Everybody want some, shit they supposed to
Look how we did it, took a pot, made our own food
All out of hand outs, mama at my  auntâ€™s house
Livin' with my Auntie, the underworld hunts me
I'm too much a mac, I can't lack what you missin'
Take minor setbacks I'm right back like repenting
Dope boy certified, new Belenciagas
Mistress misty-eyed , I don't ever kissed her bye
Started with a fork, tryna get it off the forklift
Jumped off the porch watch me land on the Forbes list
What you thought I was just sloppy
Your neighbors gon' pop up and play paparazzi
Your best friend gon' spot me and post it on IG
Them screenshots be obvious, make me anonymous
I'd rather talk then text I avoid politic
Shoppin' that politics robbin' shit like a lick
Meet at the room bitch

[Hook]
I don't wanna pull up to your house
You got too many people in your business
You need to put a mirror on your mouth
And watch what you say when you jump out this Benz bitch
Watch what you say
Watch what you say when you jump out this Benz bitch
Watch what you say
Our business, our business don't mention your feelings
Watch what you say

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna pull up to your house
Don't wanna meet you by your job you call me I'm unavailable
Cause I can walk at you I know hoes they gon' run and tell I ain't giving you all these variables
You and your friends in my business
My business's my business, your friendship ain't shit to lose
What we had at limits, get rehab you missed it I ended our visits With handshakes no kisses, got head no forensics
I said it I meant it, it start where it finished
You jumped out this Benz and told your friends it's rented
That did make no difference they still gon' jump in it
You still won't admit it, you runnin your mouth
I had work in my kitchen you know what I'm bout
Loose lips make court dates
So fuck a witness on a Lord's day
Bitch I'm RJ and

[Hook]
I don't wanna pull up to your house
You got too many people in your business
You need to put a mirror on your mouth
And watch what you say when you jump out this Benz bitch
Watch what you say
And watch what you say when you jump out this Benz bitch
Watch what you say
Our business, our business don't mention your feelings


[Bridge]
Watch what you say
Watch what you say
Watch what you say
Watch what you say when you jump out this Benz bitch
Watch what you say
Our business, our business don't mention your feelings


[Hook]
I don't wanna pull up to your house
You got too many people in your business
You need to put a mirror on your mouth
And watch what you say when you jump out this Benz bitch
Watch what you say
And watch what you say when you jump out this Benz bitch
Watch what you say
Our business, our business don't mention your feelings
