[Intro: RJ]
You only want a nigga popping, huh?
You want a one, but got options, huh?
Oh baby
What kind of fool do you take me for?

[Hook: RJ]
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars

[Verse 1: Choice]
This travel lodge parking lot, with a laptop
And a green dot my dirty girl tryin' to plant us  up a beanstalk
Choice, you see this weather daddy, now we can't walk
Crafty hoes slip between these rain drops
My new tinder date gets LA traffic
Got skinny hoes back, now the bitch can't stand me
Her old pimp came through and dropped her clothes off
Got lazy with the other, so I cut them both off, now
Why buy the cow when her milk is in the glass
Why cry when it spills, when champagne is in the fridge, bitch
Cause I felt like saying it out the womb with this game
No one said I was playing it, hey
On a radian if she got it I'm taking it, kay
My first APT and the CDPD raided it, kay
Racks on the regular, day weed [?]

[Verse 2: RJ]
I talk money early, call it translating
Pay me up front like advance paper
I met a third party, it was second paper
How I had her coming out her clothes [?]
I'm skinny dipping and I'm honest
Running games track practice bare arms like I'm tatted
I [?] grab if I pack it it all don't leave a Jackson
Work a bitch to the max, that's affirmative action, nigga
All these dead guys on me, of course I'm thriller
Got a bitch that suck the nails out a coffin, nigga
Mother fuck friends when the love in
Get your main thing, gang bang, called it jumped in

[Hook: RJ]
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars

[Verse 3: Jay 305]
Go get no gimmies, flamed up like Santa
Slip my big ass through your chimney
You worthless if you broke
You like an old ass kidney
You better get up off your ass, and get this money
Money, money, money, keep the bottles coming
Then I'll fuck your bitch, I ain't gotta spend shit
Oh, I'm the shit
Played the nice guy, then I turned into a pimp
Babysit her kids while I break the bitch
Other people's mens, now I'm straight legit
You jumped me in '02, I need that favor quick
Off some statement shit
Still with the business, and I got my own business
Bitch, I'm the intercity [?]
Fuck these, teach your kids to sell dope
How you fresh outta jail, and ain't broke?
How you got two songs and signed to Interscope?

[Hook: RJ]
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
Never love a bitch, I need all my dollars
