[Intro]
I swear when I get that check
I don't know how to act, shit
We gon blow that motherfucker
And make it right back
Uh-Oh
S-P-L-A-C-C


[Hook: Splacc]
When I get that check I don't know how to act
I-I-I-I I swear
I go get that check and don't know how to act
I-I-I-I I swear
When I get that check I don't know how to act
I-I-I-I I swear
I go get that check and don't know how to act
I-I-I-I I swear

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
I  got a Glock and got a knock
Got a tec and got respect
Hit a lick and got a check
And now I'm ballin' with no net
Got a maro and a vet
I swear to God, you wanna bet?
But I am never in that bitch
Cause Neffy can't drive a stick
I'm from the Bay we keep it lit
I wore a Bape and fucked your bitch
I rock a mask cause I'm sick and I am with the shit
Just left 3P and I spent bout 6
In a Bape outfit stay with a banana clip
Niggas can't act when they come up on shit
We was trappin' out the motel view from the 6
I will never slip cause I'm all about my grip
Saucy and bossy I got chips with the dip
[?]
Jumpin' out the gyn no need for a rim
Turnt to the max yeah my shit is on 10
I rap for the N's I am not you niggas friends

[Hook: Splacc]
When I get that check I don't know how to act
I-I-I-I I swear
I go get that check and don't know how to act
I-I-I-I I swear
When I get that check I don't know how to act
I-I-I-I I swear
I go get that check and don't know how to act
I-I-I-I I swear

[Verse 2: RJ]
I act a fool with that check
Send my bitch back to school with that check
Bought my baby brand new shoes with that check
Don't bet against me, you might lose your whole check
You ain't a threat you don't ball, you get use playin' pick up
I'm out the mud without a scratch but my wrist cut
And you don't inch or reserve you a broke boy
You believe that shit from a bird we don't go for it
Pull up car full of hoes like a golf court
Hop out slammin' door in some Tom Fords
Still ignoring all critics, sellin' front roll tickets
Back back to the back, top roll showin' titties
Mister LA you gettin Citadel
Late I'm up early trynna pass the NFL Play
Niggas jumpin' off of Jets
Just landed up in Jersey
What's a Swish without the Net?
I'm blowin' checks but don't search me I swear

[Hook: Splacc]
When I get that check I don't know how to act
I-I-I-I I swear
I go get that check and don't know how to act
I-I-I-I I swear
When I get that check I don't know how to act
I-I-I-I I swear
I go get that check and don't know how to act
I-I-I-I I swear
