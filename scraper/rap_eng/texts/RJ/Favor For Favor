[Hook: RJ]
We makin' love on the first date
She said this gon' be her first time
You'll be buyin' all kinds of shit
I only see her doing halftime
If we sneakin' and geekin', it's nothin'
We be sneakin' and geekin' and fuckin'
She only call me when she need attention
I found out she just need a nut
And that's a favor a favor, favor for a favor (do me a favor)
I do a favor for a favor, favor for a favor
A favor for a favor

[Verse 1: RJ]
We don't need no numbers, just slide in them DMs
Erase 'em, I hide 'em, so no one'll see 'em
We keep our shit silent, give no one a reason to know (ah)
Okay, her man got a wife, she his life through the week
And she even kiss his kids goodnight before sleepin'
You hit me, I pull up like Huggies, I [?] and I go
No we don't speak in the streets, but we fuckin'
I sold her brother a couple of onions
She say don't tell him that we did it in the first place
'Cause he know the other nigga that be cuffin'
Okay, I be tight grill, she be high heels
I take my time, she loves the thrills
We slide through my hood, she's dressed to kill
I won't steer you wrong, since the one we been on

[Hook: RJ]
We makin' love on the first date
She said this gon' be her first time
You'll be buyin' all kinds of shit
I only see her doing halftime
If we sneakin' and geekin', it's nothin'
We be sneakin' and geekin' and fuckin'
She only call me when she need attention
I found out she just need a nut
And that's a favor a favor, favor for a favor (do me a favor)
I do a favor for a favor, favor for a favor
A favor for a favor

[Verse 2: Choice]
Everytime I see her face it's from a friend call
I call her, why you even got a man for
Playin' for the wrong team, even though your ex changed
And you won't find a thief in fear, exchange
My counter marble, not granite, was faithful to the hooker
Took in all that for granted, and love with the pimps
Now her night is the gladdest, yeah mine is the baddest
You bitch wouldn't be attractive if she swallowed a magnet
Now, where was I? The city where she got me off the ground
Done sold my clout and grabbed her out the lost and found
Now when we spot her nigga and my woman frown
What's president s'posed to do when Olivia come around?
I don't know, hit on the phone, rock in a boat, shoppin' the coast, stoppin' for no, one
Marry the money, I don't elope
She 'bout to blow, your dough, cause you giving it up
She blow this dick and blow up your phone, to come pick her up

[Hook: RJ & Splacc]
We makin' love on the first date

She only call me when she need attention
I found out she just need a nut
And that's a favor a favor, favor for a favor (do me a favor)
I do a favor for a favor, favor for a favor (S-P-L-A-C-C)
A favor for a favor

[Verse 3: Splacc]
Nigga, what the fuck you think Splacc mean? (what)
All I do is pick the bitch, you set the back screen (aha)
Fellatio, I beat the pussy up, and then I leave (alright)
Don't got the number, but I got the IG name
Ended up in her DM, and the BD hotter than BM (okay)
Won't allow her to see him, but she swallowin' my semen (aha)
Head heathen, easy to crack like seaman (alright)
Her missed calls in my recents, pussy lip, drip cameos that she sent (alright)
I turn around, you walk, made her switch up on you (okay)
It never fails, alcohol goes against the loyal (yaa)
She got you reachin' for your phone, that's that paranoia (yaa)
She take off in your whip, and then we hit a corner (skkrt)
Never put it past 'er like a church guy (alright)
She be back on the team, like Jordan 45 (okay)
She hit me on my comments, but don't get a reply (no)
She be back to chasin' knots like a neck tie
