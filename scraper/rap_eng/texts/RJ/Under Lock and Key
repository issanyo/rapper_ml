Under the orange tree, save some room for me
I’ll meet you there again
Over the span of time, start to realize
But you leave important
And you were the best friend
And we’re falling down on our time tonight

To the space out the moments
Waving the passing byes again
Did you think they would break for you?
Slow dance
And watch what they make of you

Yeah I’m under, I’m under
I’m under a lock and key
Yeah I’m under, I’m under
I’m under a lock and key

Yeah I’m under, I’m under
I’m under a lock and key
Yeah I’m under, I’m under
I’m under a lock and key

So save some room for me
Save some room for me
Under the orange tree, save some room for me
I’ll meet you there once more
You were a best friend, in a known life

I’ll hold you as dear that I can
And the same day, we lost you
It doesn't make much sense, oh no
I took your picture off the book
So long, under a lock and key we drown

Yeah I’m under, I’m under
I’m under a lock and key
Yeah I’m under, I’m under
I’m under a lock and key

Yeah I’m under, I’m under
I’m under a lock and key
Yeah I’m under, I’m under
I’m under a lock and key

So save some room for me
So save some room for me
We don’t know if we’re breaking down
We don’t know if we’re breaking down

So save some room for me
