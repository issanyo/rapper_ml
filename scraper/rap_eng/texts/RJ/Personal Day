[Verse 1:]
Hold up, my fault I’ll own up
You should do the same but you’d rather get a one up
I done pressing your luck
Stressing you should roll up
Got some anger issues that you never took control of
I done pressing your luck
Stressing you should roll up
Got some anger issues that you never take control of
Always think I diss you
You just don’t know how I show love
I know I’m hardly with you when it hit you but I show up
You can say I’m fickle
U don’t trick you, I just grow up
Put you in them picture make sure everybody know us
You know what
Why we talk about what happen
We should leave it where it happen
What we need to do
Let’s spend a day out getting pampered
Leave the laundry in the hamper
Take the scenic route
Yeah we good round whoever
But it’s always better when it’s me and you
Them reservation here weighing
Think we need a vacation
I’m just saying

[Chorus:]
We got a whole lot of personal issues to let go tonight
Even though we both wrong
I’m gonna set the tone, I’m getting you right
Let’s go on a litle date
Our personal day
We gon’ do a little date
Have our own little day
Our personal day
Yeah we got a little date

[Verse 2:]
Lately we’ve been leaving thoughts in the air
Like we don’t work out
I’m floss to compare
Sometimes you got me in awe
I’m back, I was lost, yeah
We break up to make up
Just wake up no make up
Got cake with your nigga
Now watch this I got a new move
Remember last time you had cried
You couldn’t even move
Time after time still got something to prove
I’m, did you mean rival me, rival you
Pack up your arguments, we’ve got a room
We gon’ keep sparks as long as there’s fuel
I reserved us a spa day, by the pool
By the lake, by the way
You know you know we can’t be late
This our day

[Chorus]
