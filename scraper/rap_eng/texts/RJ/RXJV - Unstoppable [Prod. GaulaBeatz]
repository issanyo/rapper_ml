[Verse 1]
Girl don’t ya lie to me
I know you want to be with me
I feel it in your tears
Everyday I’m walk-in down the hallway
Chasing our pathways
Thinking how long we shared these chains
But always feel sick to my stomache
Because I know I did something and fucked up our lane
Woooo ahhhhh why ya changing
Why ya changing
Changing
Why you changing
Woooooo ahhh you changing

[Verse 2]
Girl don’t you go
Your so special
Yes you are yes indeed
Look me in the eyes and tell me you hate me
Cause you know you don’t
We can be together and then we can flee
To San Francisco or maybe Paris
Forget about everything and let’s go threw stages stages
Stages
Yeah yea ah

[verse 3]
Girl don’t ya lie to me
I know you want to be with me
I feel it in your tears
Everyday I’m walk-in down the hallway
Chasing our pathways
Thinking how long we shared these chains
But always feel sick to my stomache
Because I know I did something and fucked up our lane
Woooo ahhhhh why ya changing
Why ya changing
Changing
Why you changing
Woooooo ahhh you changing
