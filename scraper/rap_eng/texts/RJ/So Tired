[Hook: Jay Nevz]
I'm so fucking tired of the same old shit
So fucking tired of the same old whip
I've had it up to here with the same old chicks
Too many bitches think they game so slick
I'm so fucking tired of the same old shit
So fucking tired of the same old whip
I've had it up to here with the same old chicks
Too many bitches think they game so slick

[Verse 1: Jay Nevz]
Yo my whole life, I've been tryna be a star
Convincing myself to just be who you are
If you work every day, you're bound to go far
The world on my back, [?]
But fuck that chick I used to [?]
Gettin in my feels you could call me a pussy
They always gonna laugh just because I'm a rookie
Till my shit starts pumpin now they runnin up to me
Yeah and everything you do they gonna judge you on it
It's a fucked up place I don't wanna be on it
All this negative energy man I just wanna vomit
We at war with each other, when the fuck is it stoppin
To be really honest man probably never
I guess as a whole we just gotta be better
Or maybe get lucky like a lottery winner
I know deep deep down everybody a sinner

[Hook: Jay Nevz]
I'm so fucking tired of the same old shit
So fucking tired of the same old whip
I've had it up to here with the same old chicks
Too many bitches think they game so slick
I'm so fucking tired of the same old shit
So fucking tired of the same old whip
I've had it up to here with the same old chicks
Too many bitches think they game so slick

[Verse 2: K!dph!lly]
Yeah
But that's all
I'm so fucking tired I've been getting all these plays
Now they wanna come around say Philly you the man
I don't get it bruh...
Just wait till me and Nevz drop a mothafucka
Then we drop a mothafucka if he starting with the shits
Cause he ain't with the shits I call that a Lil Bitch
That's a first track hit, yeah we been about a rip

Ayy, going crazy, on everything I do
I've been going crazy, can you please make a move
I've been going crazy, [?]
I'm a beat this shit out mofucka [?]
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
I'ma major independent and I feed the fam with god
I'm puttin in this work but I already got a job
I'ma light this shit up so just [?]
Philly

[Outro: Jay Nevz]
So fucking tired
I'm so fucking tired
So fucking tired
I'm so fucking tired
I'm so fucking tired of the same old shit
So fucking tired of the same old whip
I've had it up to here with the same old chicks
Too many bitches think they game so slick
I'm so fucking tired of the same old shit
So fucking tired of the same old whip
I've had it up to here with the same old chicks
Too many bitches think they game so slick
