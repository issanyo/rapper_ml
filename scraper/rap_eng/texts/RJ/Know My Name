[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I'm a boss, I might flex on a bitch
I ain't lying, spend a grip on my wrist
If she bad I might take her to the red carpet
Bought a car, now I'm tryna learn how to start it
Bitch you know my name, pop up, hit it then I slide
Tell your man don't do you right
When I got that money I ain't change up
Bitch you know my name, I got paper
I'm a boss, I might flex on a bitch
I ain't lying, spend a grip on my wrist
If she bad I might take her to the red carpet
Bought a car, now I'm tryna learn how to start it
Bitch you know my name, pop up, hit it then I slide
Tell your man don't do you right
When I got that money I ain't change up
Bitch you know my name, I got paper

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Bitch you know my name, bitch you know my name
Bitch I'm rich forever, put that on my chain
Got these haters mad, we got plenty cash
And all them hoes put the money in a paper bag
Now these haters too salty
Do the math, mourine, that's a ten piece
Woke up with a bank on a new day
Last night dreaming 'bout a new Wraith
Don't she know me? I'm the GOAT like Kobe
I got that check and call the jeweler told him freeze me
Word around town that I made it
Two freaks, one coupe going crazy
I did broke that bitch bed now she stalking me
Mommy told me more money, more enemies
Had to learn that
Bring your girl around me, get your bitch snatched

I'm a boss, I might flex on a bitch

If she bad I might take her to the red carpet
Bought a car, now I'm tryna learn how to start it
Bitch you know my name, pop up, hit it then I slide
Tell your man don't do you right
When I got that money I ain't change up
Bitch you know my name, I got paper

[Verse 2: RJ]
I ain't lying, ayy
I ain't lying, ayy
I ain't lying
Got them eyeing my designs from the side
Side eyeing all these dogs from behind
Throw a bundle in her girdle, make her hunch over, ayy
All these rush for it
I'm a boss, she gon' work for it
She's the one who hold you down from the first floor, ayy
Started from the ground, I'm a vert boy, ayy
Slap them rims on it, make them worth more, ayy
Spent about a hunnid on the shirt for it, ayy
This that type a verse with a hayayaya
Goyard on my waist
Fell out of love, then I jumped in that Wraith
Slid in that at the club with my drum on display
From my gums to my range, bust down like a layover

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Gotta stay one hunnid, I can't change up
Bitches wanna fuck me 'cause I'm famous
Tell your bitch to leave her face painted
She put her number in my phone but I ain't save it
Girl I stay one hunnid, I can't change up
Bitches wanna fuck me 'cause I'm famous
Tell your bitch to leave her face painted
She put her number in my phone but I ain't save it
