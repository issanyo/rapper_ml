[Intro]
Please you don’t give a fuck
Fuck you I hate you my nigga
I swear to God I wish I would
Never had another kid by you
I go by the name of G5 like this
Nothing last forever

[Verse]
Never fall in love with a trick
Tell a trick give me ray give me ray
Some more you gonna have a
Player player if you let a player player
Then I question an ebony

[Hook]
No have you ever fell out of love before
Have you ever fell out of love before

[Verse 2]
Yo I did a bottle like oh to the scrapes
Ans bros might have took it too far
With these scrapes and croakers
I’ve been thugging hell a hard
Lost my ways in music
You’ll be robbing your rules
Get all in my face and I lose it
Losing a friend misguiding your trust
I might driving you crazy
When I sink you were clutching
You’ll be fighting for us
I’ll be on that little leach
Trying to find a better me
I cannot regrettably
Make up without the blush
We just fighting for
Rappers storing stash so
We can’t hold a punch
I’ve been on that rush
Fast break fuck a one time
Anticipating free to go to the next one
Like a boss
So I feel out of love before
I just want to know if
You been drag through the mud before
You been done for sure
I want to throw you back but this is a question

[Hook]
I want you to ask have you ever fell out of love before
Have you ever fell out of love before
Have you ever fell out of love before
Cause I fell out of love before
Tell me have you ever felt out of love before

[Verse 3]
How does it feel to not love no more
The winner seperate you like an underscore
Spring come around you ain’t sprung no more
All you bitches get me fucked up if you ever caught me slippin
Thinking blocked up it was never my intention was fucked up
Got these bitches taking pictures like it’s some nutt show
And I’m gonna treat them pretty bitches like it’s just us
Yea we gonna freak in my defence we going to cluff up
Hey it ain’t no deeper like your feeling you my love one
Ain’t got to sneak out nowhere to be

[Hook]
Have you ever fell out of love before
I feel out of love before
Yea I felt out of love before
Have you felt out of love before
