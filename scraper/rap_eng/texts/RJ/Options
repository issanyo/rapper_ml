[Intro]
Cookie Money
Boy, you hella tall

[Chorus: RJ]
Ayy, graduated from that small shit, baby, dig me up
I'm too faded, wrecked my car, gotta pick me up
Mask on, who that kid that had that fifty tucked?
Yeah they showed up squad deep but it's too many us
Everybody gotta eat, they ain't feedin' us
Really got it out the streets, that was really us, yeah
Really got it out the mud, wasn't too many options
Shit, now we got some options

[Verse 1: RJ]
Poppin', now we got options to play with
That Cookie RJ shit, LA to the Bay, bitch
Blazin', this sound like heat in the makin'
Bangin', whole team eat like a banquet
Flamin', bitch, ven aqui with that payment
Fragrant, dress in my sleep, no blanket
Statements, them only lead to arrangements
Dangerous, Cliffwood, squeeze 'til it's vacant, ayy
Now we got options to play with, ayy
Ones that them opps ain't gon' play with, ayy
Still got the drops, we don't play fair, ooh
Throwin' bitches off the yacht in they fake hair

[Chorus: RJ]
Graduated from that small shit, baby, dig me up
I'm too faded, wrecked my car, gotta pick me up
Mask on, who that kid that had that fifty tucked?
Yeah they showed up squad deep but it's too many us
Everybody gotta eat, they ain't feedin' us
Really got it out the streets, that was really us, yeah
Really got it out the mud, wasn't too many options
Shit, now we got some options

[Verse 2: Cookie Money]
Ayy, where you from, lil' nigga?
From the slums where you better keep a gun, lil' nigga
But them pussy ass niggas, I don't fuck with those niggas
Red beam on this Glock, swear to God I won't miss 'em, ayy
Late nights, mask down with the semi tucked
We'll lay your ass down, nigga, give it up
Nigga take it all off like a strip club
Lil' Cook a big dog, nigga, dig me up
A hundred bands from a thot, bet I won't kiss her
Nutted all in her mouth and you still miss her
I heard you bought that Louis bag, nigga, last Christmas
You a worker, I'm a boss, it's a big difference

[Chorus: RJ]
Graduated from that small shit, baby, dig me up
I'm too faded, wrecked my car, gotta pick me up
Mask on, who that kid that had that fifty tucked?
Yeah they showed up squad deep but it's too many us
Everybody gotta eat, they ain't feedin' us
Really got it out the streets, that was really us, yeah
Really got it out the mud, wasn't too many options
Shit, now we got some options
