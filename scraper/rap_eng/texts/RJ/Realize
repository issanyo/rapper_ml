[Verse 1: RJ]
Uhhhh
I don't park whips niggas, leave it for the valet
Ice Bucket Challenge, diamonds dancing like a ballet
Kush car alarm mind far gone, AR 1 5 Red eye
Seems like a milla die
4 5 harmed eyes wish bone upper thighs
That will change your tone
Like a autotune synthesize
Sympathize for nothing
No tears just ballin
Just a bunch of bad bitches two sips from alcoholic
Can't call it, Man my phone die
Nigga I don't have fans at half time
And cocaine talk money, call it chat line
Jews on me, see me galking and I'm a rap guy
Chest high send a shooter get him baptized
Tell him fill it to the rim like a flat tire
Paul Man
Bingo !! but its all on the bench
I pinpoint a prospect popped the sharpest of the pink
Don't know what you are shooting for in life
Take a shot to the clique
And Hop me in the whip
Caught me with a sloppiest pennies
I dread fuck em all
They only call cause my tomorrow
Im showing off learned to ball with a broken heart
Throw the ball bet it all go to longest yard
If you see something then leap off a nigga

[Hook]
You ain't help build it
Or get it started
But you wanna live it
I beg your pardon
Ain't it funny when they realize
They finally start to realize
I live it

[Verse 2: Chocice]
Real eyes are gonna realize the real lies
Fresh out the county no Shoe laces still fly
Two bricks to Garfield rick way i builds mine
After samson here got sliced this cab't spend nice
Get ride with god his purpose gotta me greater
Just 1500 tryna start me in stables
Spend 250 on a ounce I had 1250 left
Bought a room for my worker bought a script to myself
She put 8 hours
Came with 35 franks
Just imagine if she did this shit in 35 states
So mine 30 for 30 ESPN film make
24 Benji off the moxi blue fields
Up to 5900 plus the 6 I still have
65 from 15 plus big week to drag
I laugh how you turn your floorplan to a  fortress
I won't even look you a the floor shit

[Hook]
You ain't help build it
Or get it started
But you wanna live it
I beg your pardon
Ain't it funny when they realize
They finally start to realize
I live it
