Lord we want to approach [?]
And thank you for everything you have done for us
We know you direct our steps and we thank you
For that as well
We are not where we want to be but we
Are not where we once were
Lord we praise you, we know that
You give us the authority to proclaim
Victory over our lives and in Jesus name
We order the doors to be open with
Blessings and take comfort that it will be done
We declare that all our dreams come true
Let love and unity  be our focus in Jesus name we pray
