[Verse 1: RJ]
Look, she can't do it on a dick then she not that bitch
When a bitch blows me she needs lots of spit
Or a motherfucking deal if the clique not included
You say you sign for a mill, I say thas how I prostituted
Getting fucked and recorded that's pornography
Rappers telling my story no biography
I had a bad little bitch who used to flock for me
She went to jail when her momma lost property
Aye yo hold up baby, life kinda crazy lookin over my soldier ever since I became famous
Man, I just really want to be known for my talent, you just really tryna get on with your talents
Fuck it, pop that, being top that
Got these niggas on my head like a top hat
I'm putting on for my city, niggas got songs they wanna send me
My groupie fans are getting pretty, I'm on a roll on my momma

[Chorus: RJ]
(I feel like) real niggas feel like me
(I feel like) big money's all I need
(I feel like) I can fuck them all tonight, if you can pot it with a dick in you girl you flight
(Do ya thang like) Do yo thang
(Do ya thang like) Do yo thang
(Do ya thang like) Do yo thang
(Do ya thang like) Do yo thang
