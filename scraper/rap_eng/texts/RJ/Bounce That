Yeah

[Verse 1: RJ]
R. motherfuck a bitch
Blame mustard if you mad a nigga rich
See I'm an asshole, got hundreds with me like a block crip

Cause really he a bitch in every language
Young nigga ballin' no D1

[Verse 2: Royce The Choice]
Look, got him textin' her he need some'
She in this threesome, call around three some'
Please come show it late night like a re-run
Three blunts, two black ants and a Seagram
Drank It, copped a private like it stole your baby
Race it, no discrimination, bitch my favorite color naked
Cold as pavement out in Anchorage, I'ma cast a silver blanket
We ain't fuckin', I won't even make a statement
Bitch you know where to take it

[Hook: Royce The Choice]
To the ground type shit
I just wanna see it in your mouth right quick
Slim chance I need a wife with my account that thick
How much money you going up for a house that sick?
I go "Bitch, bounce that shit, shake it 'til the DJ, announce that shit"
I go "Bitch, bounce that shit, shake it 'til the DJ, announce that shit"

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Look

Never hit without a rubber mama that ain't safe, aye
Real nigga baby ain't shit fake
I don't know about them other niggas

Money long but I still run through it
I'm a Inglewood nigga, bitch you know how we do it
Bout cheese, guap, yaper, skrilla
Call me: "Skeme" call me: "Crooked" or "The Bad Bitch Killa", huh

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Yeah
Girl you a intern, know you with the business
A ho, a housewife
Tell me whats the difference
She never seen a young nigga make a livin'
Ridin' whips that her daddy ain't gettin'
Yeah, if we don't grind we don't eat though
Them girls love me from the valley down to Pico
If she bout it she gone let a nigga see some'
If she suck it then I might have to eat some'

[Hook: Royce The Choice]

[Verse 4: TC4800]
Ayy, uh, I got hoes in my catalog
Town nigga bang to the yankee call
Uh, "cash out", them my favorite words
Pull up on a bitch I don't say a word
I hit the mall then my niggas splurge
Ride up on your bitch she got a lot of curves
Hit the purp, hit the purp, nigga
She got big doors, she go to work, nigga

[Verse 5: Reem Riches]
Wabitty wabitty drop drop it like it's hot
Then take it to the top, and make the pussy pop
It's young Reem
You know I got a thing for thick bitches
You know i got a thing for big knots, my name "Riches"
Drop it low, then shake it like a seizure
I hit it, next day catch amnesia
Ballin', young nigga movement
Got ya bitch choosin'
Bouncin' all stupid, like
