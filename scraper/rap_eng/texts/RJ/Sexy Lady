[Intro]
(My baby, yeah)
(She’s a sexy Lady)
(Said yeah yeah yeah)
(She’s a sexy lady)
(My baby, she she’s a sexy lady)
Rayon, silk, or maybe even denim (she’s so sexy)
Really doesn't matter as long as she's in them

[Verse 1]
Petite señorita said hello it’s nice to meet ya
With a smile so sweet made a instant believer 
Swept her off her feet just like a ballerina
She's tall drink of water stronger than tequila 
Baby boy was feigning when his mama asked the reason
Said I seen a piece of art shoulda been in a museum
Stole my heart and now my being
Needs more than jewels and Europeans
It’s no secret that looks can be deceiving
But he like her for even more than what he’s seeing
Baby girl is a scholar not a lot of drama
She makes his heart sing
Baby girl is rider, so glad he got her
Straight up loyalty
And it ain't no thang for him to treat her like a queen
Yeah she's royalty

[Hook]
(My baby)
Oh yeah she winning
(She’s a sexy lady)
Rayon silk or maybe even denim
Really don’t matter as long as she’s in them
[x2]

[Bridge]
My my baby sexy lady can’t believe you’re my girl
My my baby so amazing I wanna share my world
My my baby drives me crazy I never been so sure
You are the one I adore, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now they on another level put the pedal to the medal
Can you feel the breeze
Sun is shining to the top they climbing
Like it’s destiny
Try to infiltrate, fat chance
He's holding on like it’s the last dance
Romance is essential, fulfilling their potential
Connecting on the spiritual, physical and mental
Beasting in the streets, he's a lion
She brings him to his knees even when she's not trying
Compromise is ease won’t be no denying
Aiming to please soon multiplying
Love so high seem like they flying
Try to come between gone be a riot
I bet they gone be together always & forever
Forever forever ever forever ever

[Hook]
(My baby)
Oh yeah she winning
(She’s a sexy lady)
Rayon silk or maybe even denim
Really don’t matter as long as she’s in them
