[Verse 1: RJ]
I can't let her talk on a whim
She only start when I end
Won't see me falling
I once took my scrapes to my chin
You chasing my charge, I'm replace 'em
She wait until I call
It's never nothing personal intended
You get what you deserve, I go and get it
She gon' run it 'til she win it
Crack your bird then refurbish her ceiling
Let he know that I'm married to the work
'Til I'm buried in the dirt
Confused at first 'til i drew it out perfect
Show out what it's worth, need you a little thirsty
Show me all your needs, for sure you stop searching
Shoulders to your knees, the coldest hot virgin

[Hook: Fresco]
You takin' all this all personal
I'mma get my shit, get hers to go
You take your time, you been hurt before
I see you the type that ain't never been curved before
Well don't take this personal, no
Don't take this personal
(Don't take it personal)
Don't take it so personal
Don't take this personal
(Don't take it personal)

[Verse 2: RJ]
How come when I do me, you take it personal
And why you take IG personal?
And the second I'm up you the first to know
I just messaged my plug he know I need that person- off that anecdote
You are what you eat, who you famish for?
Since your heart can not see, use your mind as your telescope
(I see 'em coming) I keep my eye on everybody that's watching me
And since my go bust down, I lost my privacy
And still my circle so small it's a dot to me
Ain't nothing personal, honestly
On my momma nigga...
I might pass out, bitch where my weed?
That's my personal
(Don't take it personal...
Look what we got over here)

[Hook: Fresco]
You takin' all this all personal
I'mma get my shit, get hers to go
You take your time, you been hurt before
I see you the type that ain't never been curved before
Well don't take this personal, no
Don't take this personal
(Don't take it personal)
Don't take it so personal
Don't take this personal
(Don't take it personal)
