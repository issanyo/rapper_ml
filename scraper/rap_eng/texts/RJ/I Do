[Chorus]
Married to the streets
Oh they say you think you got something special
I do
You looking like your on some other level
I do
That shit you be on got them jealous
I do
I got married to these chicks you were at the wedding
I do
Nigga I do nigga I do
Nigga I do nigga I do
Nigga I do nigga I do

[Verse 1]
Nigga I do I, I, I, I, do I do not
Do what you do if you have what I got
I'm not the juiciest food of the flock now
I come from noodles and juice out the box
Married to these streets at a young age
I ain't had a beef with a no name
Base triple beans under cocaine
Who came with the feet called it for play
Lat a 100 blend on a one ten
Dagger blue mean like I'm jumping
Off guard shooting with my left hand
I'm from where nobody knows but the Yes man

[Chorus]
Oh they say you got something special
I do
You looking like your on some other level
I do
That shit you be on got them jealous
I do
I got married to these chicks you were at the wedding
I do
Nigga I do nigga I do
Nigga I do nigga I do

[Verse 2]
I I I swigger drive through the
City makes it heavy when I slide through
I I I with a pocket full of Fendi got me thinking like I'm Big Sue
I I I these damn presents just
Receive full of shit that I've been through
I I I and four times out of a five
I got an issue married to the pistol
Sheen with the shot every shot held against you
I think my neighbors talking to the Federal officials
I'm paranoid keep a load of tat between my pillows
You ain't see nothing till you see your money triple
Then you turn around and see that same change gone
You ain't get nothing till you fuck some twin models
In a two-seater with the roof back braze bro yeah nigga

[Chorus]
Oh they say you think you got something special
I do
You looking like your on some other level
I do
That shit you be on got them jealous
Uh
I got married to these chicks you where at the wedding
I do
Nigga I do nigga I do
