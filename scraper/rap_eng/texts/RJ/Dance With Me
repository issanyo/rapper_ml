[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
Walked in with my bros
It's a lot of honey's in the spot
This Dom and RJ, that's a lot of
Mustard on that beat, ho

[Hook : Dom Kennedy]
Walked in with my bros
It's a lot of honey's in the spot
This Dom and RJ, that's a lot of money
Dance with me girl, dance with me girl
Who's this textin' me sayin' please come through around 3 some

[Verse 1 : RJ]
I pull up with my piece it was over
The chain match the whip, the rims Kobe
She feenin' and she thirsty so she obey
She snort the coke off the dick and caught a dope case
At this point I really need a robot
The game so seperate it got it's own box
I ain't always in town, but I'm here tonight
Yeah I love it when their face is down, behind up in the sky
All this ace i'm get chilly with my other mitt
I move the cake up out the city and some other shit
She call me, say "I'm comin' over who you commin' with"
I fuckin' at you and in the container with no published shit
I ain't trynna throw my way around but I'm
Mister LA baby, you wanna dance just choose


[Hook : Dom Kennedy]
Walked in with my bros
It's a lot of honey's in the spot
This Dom and RJ, that's a lot of love
Walked in with my bros
It's a lot of honey's in the spot
This Dom and RJ, that's a lot of money
Dance with me girl, dance with me girl
Who's this textin' me sayin' please come through around 3 some


[Verse 2 : RJ]
I pull at 3 somethin' it was feelin' tricky
Check my pistol make sure that my clip ain't empty
Waited all summer but you ass is Mickey
She only call my number when she want a quickie
Sometimes I don't answer the phone
And if you comin' we don't talk, I act like I ain't home
I'm just staring at you through this tint
I tell you exactly what you need if you just listen
I'm just rollin' up, I split the weed just like division
I don't really know this bitch I met her through my mentions
Heard I fucked her cousin good and paid her no attention
Not to mention I'm on Insta, diamonds trippin' I'm just chillin'
Like detention I'm here from a distance [?]
I got visions of testing her limits, imagine her sight
Aye, If you pass you my type

[Hook : Dom Kennedy]
Walked in with my bros
It's a lot of honey's in the spot
This Dom and RJ, that's a lot of love
Walked in with my bros
It's a lot of honey's in the spot
This Dom and RJ, that's a lot of money
Dance with me girl, dance with me girl
