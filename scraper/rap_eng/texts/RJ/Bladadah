[Verse 1]
You steady screaming out your team
But you snitching on them
Extensions on them triple breams come with zippers on it
I stood solid drop some knowledge got your liquids flowing
Mama I ain't make it out of college is you disappointed?
They want the old me when Mr was just in the motion
It's money over all bitches I don't miss a moment
I miss my daughter when gearing up to hit the road
I wish father here whenever I get a whiff of smoke
Don't miss the wave of Mr LA caught up in the go
You can never be near to know
I been planning my miracles
Had to manage my fears and grow
Incoming money calls dope on the line
Poke your nose in my bars there's some dope in disguise
Ain't you fed up yet? All this fake trap rap ain't develop yet
Blower came out the box like a clarinet
Throw the scope on the top what you staring at
My nigga setting weed shops up in every set
I be wearing my set ten summers charm
Til I'm tearing out the hair on my chest
That's on my son breath I'm a leader
A real feeder I'll bleed you like designer sneakers
Mr without a feature only less its fully loaded
Come through and separate the building chopper bungalowded
OK enough of that fly shit I'm overheads
On some south of Dubai bandannas on my head
My niggas learn how to ride standing on stolen pegs
Where do we go when we die and we already dead
I hit the sand on my last leg and my flag red no flag hole
I can hit your block and make your trap close
Niggas that be fronting got no backbone
I seen the future niggas passed on me
And all your new shit I had last summer
Black bomber 90 starter with the mags under
Come to the middle pick a shooter with no draft number
You can never see the thriller cos the mask on
From A to P we flee the villas when the crash come

[Refrain]
From A to P we flee the villas when the crash come
I pray my niggas flee the villas 'fore the crash come
I pray my niggas flee the villas 'fore the crash come
I pray my niggas flee the villas 'fore when crash come

[Verse 2]
Well since I'm boding beats
I keep my eyes in these streets
I hear the creep in ya feet
That's why the ride in my reach
Don't take that leap of deceit I don't think to retreat
I rather die on my feet than not compete in these streets
I turn that Jeep to a fleet
I fleeta ya fleece
I don't speak to police my lawyer fees don increased
Spray the scene like fabreeze then ammonia the sink
Drop my phone in the drink and I'm gone in a blink
I need a moment to think
Nigga I don bought a whole nigga suite
That's why there's cameras everywhere only drones can see
I got hammers and drills I'm a Lowe's on feet
These niggas at a standstill ain't nothing close to me
Nigga my OMMIO blinged out
Theres crackheads still know me from that corner house
Neighbors that never used to speak that scream my govvy out
They waving at me cause I used to take their daughter down
I'm Mr all-around South Central golden child
Mouth full of quarter pounds
Black coupe with the white roof
Call it Colin Powell
Turn it down Juice they said niggas might shoot you
Tell 'em I can't stop winning nigga feelings die mutual
I'm certified coo-coo and my colors not neutral
If you banging and you banging nigga fuck it I salute you
Bitches turn homies and homies just got religious
They heard I had lost my vicious..
