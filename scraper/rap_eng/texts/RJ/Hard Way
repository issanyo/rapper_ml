[Intro: RJMrLA & YG]
All my niggas worked for this shit
Mustard on the beat, hoe!

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi & RJMrLA]
Had to do this shit the hard way
Came up, yeah, did it our way
I belong in the Wraith like a star gaze
Young nigga, mixing Henny with the Rose
Ay, with the Rose, yeah
Young nigga, young nigga, did it our way
I belong in the Wraith like a star gaze
Ay, mix the Hen with the Rose, ay

[Post-Chorus: Swae Lee]
Looking in the mirror, I count this cash backwards
This scene I'm on is for actors and actresses
Cameras gon' flash when you're the main attraction
Bitches coming in disorderly fashion

[Verse 1: Slim Jxmmi]
Ay, check out my passion
Fresh out of Paris, put that on my taxes
Came up from nothing, I flex with a passion
Benjamin Button, I count that shit backwards

[Verse 2: RJMrLA]
Hundreds and fifties in Jacksons
I mash my heat with my jackets
Max'd out my card up in Maxfield
That's for all my flaws in the backfield
Front lie with my main side hoes
Said they want Barry's, not Domino's

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
All in my face, girl, tell me what's the reason?
Top shelf OG, man I'm barely even breathing
If I say, I imported my car, would you believe me?
Brand new Fendi jacket, it don't come out 'till next season
I gotta get this money, like a junky I be fiending
And since we grind together, I got all my niggas with me, yeah

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi & RJMrLA]
Had to get this shit the hard way
Came up, yeah, did it our way
I belong in the Wraith like a star gaze
Young nigga, mixing Hen with the Rose
Ay, with the Rose, yeah
Young nigga, young nigga, did it our way
I belong in the Wraith like a star gaze
Ay, mix the Hen with the Rose, ay

[Post-Chorus: Swae Lee]
Looking in the mirror, I count this cash backwards
This scene I'm on is for actors and actresses
Cameras gon' flash when you're the main attraction
Bitches coming in disorderly fashion
Looking in the mirror, I count this shit backwards
This scene I'm on is for actors and actresses
Cameras gon' flash when you're the main attraction
Bitches coming in disorderly fashion
Looking in the mirror, I count this shit backwards
This scene I'm on is for actors and actresses
Cameras gon' flash when you're the main attraction
Bitches coming in disorderly fashion

[Verse 4: RJMrLA]
Hold up, check out my fashion
Check out how I'm splashin'
Come touch my fabrics
Picked up this one bitch that swear she ain't ratchet
Soon as she jumped in, we fucked in the back seat
I don't even know why the plug tryna tax me
Why he act like we ain't had this here last week
Before the rap beef, I had a rap sheet, mm
Look how we run shit without a track meet

[Verse 5: Slim Jxmmi]
Ay, ay, out in L.A. catching dumb ways
Coutin' up the hunnids 'till my thumbs break
Baby make it shake, it's your birthday
You ain't a hoe if you suck it on the first day

[Verse 6: RJMrLA]
Suck me on a Thursday, that throwback, mm
Slow jamz, bob to that Womack
Chopsticks, mob shit, we on that
Give a bomb bitch bomb dick and a low jack, ooh
Girl pay attention to detail
When you with me, mention no other female?
Me, Swae, and Jimmi, that's packed shows in pre-sales
Retail, resale, she want that 4Hunnid Summers and OMMIO wave
She want Rae Sremmurd and MrLA
Astronaut juice, I just jumped out the Wraith
All those stars in the room, give me space
Get that flash out my face

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi & RJMrLA]
Had to get this shit the hard way
Came up, yeah, did it our way
I belong in the Wraith like a star gaze
Young nigga, mixing Hen with the Rose
Ay, with the Rose, yeah
Young nigga, young nigga, did it our way
I belong in the Wraith like a star gaze
Ay, mix the Hen with the Rose, ay

[Post-Chorus: Swae Lee]
Looking in the mirror, I count this cash backwards
This scene I'm on is for actors and actresses
Cameras gon' flash when you're the main attraction
Bitches coming in disorderly fashion
Looking in the mirror, I count this shit backwards
This scene I'm on is for actors and actresses
Cameras gon' flash when you're the main attraction
Bitches coming in disorderly fashion
Looking in the mirror, I count this shit backwards
This scene I'm on is for actors and actresses
Cameras gon' flash when you the main attraction
Bitches coming in disorderly fashion
