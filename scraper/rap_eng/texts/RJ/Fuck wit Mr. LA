[Verse 1]
Come fuck with Mr. LA
Its Rari's with the Bentleys
Hit the jeweler drop 20 like its pennies
Most rappers getting taxed by the 60's
Jump out of bounds get the whistle like a penalty
Seen ya to say I got some shit to say
Fuck I look like beefing with some simps
That ain't halfway on my level niggas ain't even got rent to pay
Since OMMIO 1 my kids been straight
You nigga can't belittle me these big blowers breaking penal codes
Charge possession with a deadly weapon I think your people told
He think he on you on your peak like a peeping tom
Even at your best Aaliyah had a better peace of mind
Niggas I'm bracking they burnt out
Only nigga rapping y'all should be concerned bout
Stay off my unit need more chips than my sperm count
Told my homies what her head bout call that word of mouth
Fuck up LDs leave go to Maestro's
We leave the playhouse like they left the lights on
Use to have to need a ride home now I slide on 'em
Man that Beamer dirty grade [?]
Wet the feet like a wino
Told her I don't use keys leave more room for typos
Hotel suites and fly clothes
Overnight hoes Bree up in my DMs tryna fight her
We ain't gon be doing too much time rasping
That shit dumb Travis Barker with his drum presence
I told my son I leave my mark you keep the fund spreading
Rich blood like inheriting selling drugs out the Sheraton
Sheriffs look for guns and dope
Most player of the game without the subs and coach
But when I leave this big it give a sub some hope
Shooting up the bitch shooting up the bitch playing round
Keep some stand up bitch just laying around
Cos we the most turned up hands down
We got the bity back bracking again
I lost my roof too hot back in the wind
Back to back in the Benz
Im on feet we just running these streets
Got to do it for my niggas so they sons can eat
The Mac 90 come with commas and the longest reach
These back biters die slowly I expose the leech
Woah I pull up hop out on the street
With my jewelry on loud blowing all on my jeans
Got my shirt off [?] talk all in my teeth
I know I work long shifts but its a party to me
Woah they thought I fell off I been well on
Had me in XXL but I wear large
Driving round with labels shit like an Edwards
Mr. LA I ran through every check point
Check made up in L.A yeah I'm that boy
Might just pull up drop here like a shy boy
Niggas tryna steal my shine I bought a light for 'em
Might just write for 'em..
