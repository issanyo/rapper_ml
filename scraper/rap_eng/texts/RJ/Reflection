[Intro]
I wonder if the world see the rain hit my window pain
Or it's just this cloud over me
But fuck it I'mma dress for the weather
I just looked in the mirror I'm the realest motherfucker I see

[Verse 1]
Is it me or my reflection?
The life I lead up for question
I don't trust another that's headed all direction
Got them buyin' all the tables closest to our section
And known killers offering protection
That's what these guns are for
Hold me down man these hounds like wolves on my cash
How come this rap shit make you niggas act different
I see all the game I just bought my league pass
Nigga I been watchin' yeah nigga I been watchin'
Police watchin' what I do used to runnin' out of options
Till these choppers got binoculars, 50 shots pick and choose
Is you fiend or you family?
I put the san on a salary
I don't understand why you mad at me
I’m lookin' like a lick so I brought a AK
And some straps
Watch you niggas shoot yourselves like a snap

[Hook]
I wonder if the world see the rain hit my window pane
Or it's just this cloud over me
But fuck it I'mma dress for the weather
I just looked in the mirror I'm the realest motherfucker I see
Is it me or my reflection?
I must be the realest motherfucker y'all see
All I see is my reflection
I look around I'm the realest motherfucker I see


[Verse 2]
All I see is my reflection
That's why my mirror is so impressive
You see my gun, VVS and my team we progressin'
These hoes payin' attention to my preference
I pay the difference you keep the extra
She told me I'm a blessing
She eat my dick when I'm stressin'
She gettin' fucked by a legend
You different in my presence
Nothing iffy it was destined
What If Olive wasn’t pregnant
I'm finally in your presence
Prolly high when I stepped in
Homies sideline with the redskins
More connections, I would've made it but I slept in
You make that hating look festive

[Hook]
I wonder if the world see the rain hit my window pane
Or it's just this cloud over me
But fuck it I'mma dress for the weather
I just looked in the mirror I'm the realest motherfucker I see
Is it me or my reflection?
I must be the realest motherfucker y'all see
All I see is my reflection
I look around I'm the realest motherfucker I see

[Outro]
I wonder if the world see the rain
I wonder if the world see the rain
Look around, look around, look around
Look around, look around
