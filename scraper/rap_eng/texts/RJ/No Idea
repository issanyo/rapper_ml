[Verse 1: Sunset J]
You niggas don't know commitment
For my fam I gotta get it
Went from selling O's to big pushaz splittin'
Keep ya day 1's all in position
Who am I not to hustle waitin' for [?]
Corrupt minds from the crooked system
Little nigga turnt killa since nobody missed him
Getting bread mad early like it's competition
Schools in no field trips we on a mission
Where I'm form getting paid is all tradition
Wasn't born wit it so we get it while we livin'
Can't settle even if I got a lame switch
Pussy everywhere but money my main bitch
I love my soil but I'm thinkin' Rover Range shit
I'm the nigga in the hood tryin' change shit
You think you know but you have No Idea
To flippin' dough in the trap like a Pizzaria

[Verse 2: RJ]
From slappin' chrome on it
And blackin' out the Riviera
Now I can't even look back
Cracked my rear view mirror
I cracked my phone
Sold crack out of bulb
Had that back alley sold
Pockets fat jelly roll
I'm a trap addict
Colder than that jack rabbit froze
Check my track record hoe
I'll take a stab at yo goals
And it's still a Cold Summer
Cuban links and roll runners
Yeah
Birds still dumber than the pig that built the lumber
Yeah
Long time coming
Still get linked to old numbers
Yeah
4 and the baby
Like that hoe made the rubber tear
It's always go time
And halfway no time
It's always green light on em'
When shots a co-sign
I put some dough aside
And I can't even sign for it
Safe deposit got a stash
There's cash all inside the port
Slipped out the foreign
Show em' I was lookin' right
Still got a warrant pending on me
From them Brooklyn nights
Remember back Bloods was never caught
Sportin' British Knights
Yeah I took em' back
Givenchy sweaters from the middle 90's
You niggas ain't better than my little Rodney
Shit
Our problems different than how you feel about me
Yeah
Two bottom bitches
I caught a double body
Woo
Role model citizen
The other photo copy
Yeah
My momma visiting
Hide the dope and shotty's
The sky's the floor of cockiness
So niggas won't deny me
This system fucked up
The country's over controlling
And all this chaos
Left mother Earth's ovaries swollen
Man how you fight that
Fight cops and fight blacks?
Fight me, shit I'ma fight myself if I don't fight back [X2]

[Outro: RJ]
Ayy Sunset man
They don't even know man
We had this shit planned, mapped out my nigga
Since we been back in Georgia my nigga
They don't got No Idea
No Idea we just trying
To make our pockets match our perception
You feel me?
We gon' keep it going like real niggas do
