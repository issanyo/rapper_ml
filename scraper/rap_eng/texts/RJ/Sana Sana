"Girls Town and girls all around and
Girls deh pon de catawalk and a dem a come down
Unuh hear me"


[Verse 1: AstroRB]
I did it, look at how I flipped it
2 top 10s guess I’m talking more consistent
It’s light work, looking like it might work
So I had to take the music seriously
It might work
Took a pill in KSI ain’t felt the same no more
One 9-5, no 5-9, no holiday for sure
I gave them one, I gave them two
They said they wanted more
Spent my night and day recording hits
They let me in for sure
I rhyme like this, I rap like this
But you never seen a bad man take your girl like this
We think the same way its telekinesis
I date her long time
Me no take the knee since
Do you love me? Sola, do you love me?
If you love me, you put no one above me
Yeah I do and you know I never play
But I always spend my time making
Music everyday
Cause

[Hook: AstroRB & Cindy]
Real badman never play
When I come through man no need no holiday
When I step on stage sana sana
And they craze sana sana
I’m beast when I step on the stage
Say say
Real badman never play
When I come through man no need no holiday
When I step on stage sana sana
And they craze sana sana
I’m beast when I step on the stage

[Verse 2: AstroRB]
Now she screaming, shouting
When she hear me on the beat
5 years ago she never gave me a retweet
Say she love my songs always put it on repeat
Say they love my songs always put it on repeat
But compliments don’t pay bills
I swear that’s what the money do
Shoulda be an engineer thank God the choice is optional
I was skipping classes the way I was skipping obstacles
Shoutout to the rappertoire this shit will be a spectacle
My classes, writing classics in all my classes
Practice, tell the man them tell 'em I got this
Talking, my father, my family members, my cousins
Talking, my uncle, my sister down to my aunty
And the ones that underrated never gave an RT now they hit my phone what’s the meaning of the RB
That’s the REBEL gang
And I’m repping 'em for life
When I get the cake they could all get a slice
Say

[Hook: AstroRB & Cindy]
Real badman never play
When I come through man no need no holiday
When I step on stage sana sana
And they craze sana sana
I’m beast when I step on the stage
Say say
Real badman never play
When I come through man no need no holiday
When I step on stage sana sana
And they craze sana sana
I’m beast when I step on the stage
Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

{Outro: Cindy & AstroRB}
If you love me, you put no one above me
It's the man for the night
Do you love me? Sola do you love me?
If you love me, you put no one above me
