[Verse 1: RJ]
Same nigga same clique except now I'm that guy
Nah my face ain't change, perception changed
Just the public eye
You ain't use to wanna know who I was till these songs got a buzz
You see hoes on me that make you wanna hook up
And my Instagram posts got you interested huh
Now you interested soon as I enter the club I'maaa
Trap nigga making stretch in a pot
With the 4 till it lock [?] watch
I just watch as you watch me all this paparazzi
You just wanna say you fuck a nigga like a Nazi
High key, I been in em like an IV
Try to stay exclusive but exclusive bitches try me
I must have been a ghost the whole time
Cause now you getting close like a goal line

[Hook: RJ]
Same nigga same clique except now I'm that guy
She ain't use to wanna know me, now she on me wanna come by
And I just might let her, I just might let her
I just might let her, I just might let her

[Verse 2: RJ]
I just might let her, I must look better
Cause she ain't use to wanna know me now blow me
How she on me she just won't let up
Same nigga same clique on my day 1
Convict locked up like Akon
Bitches shop till you drop with the Ye funds
Same ones never visit when the rain come
Fall in the love with the fabric of fabrication
I fucking feed her fast food you making reservation
And this fame might drive a nigga crazy
So many difference faces for lack of [?]
Nah she ain't fuck with me serving out them vacant's
Stomach steady aching and all I had was patience
Mother fuck a selfie I got self motivation
The money is the chase and she just wanna taste it
How I change when I keep it one hundred
I'm like if I break a hundred nigga you can keep the change
Put the gang on my back through these scrapes on the backburner
Two in the morning get a fat burger
Bitch!

[Hook]
