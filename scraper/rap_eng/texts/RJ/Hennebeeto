[Intro: RJ]
Yeah, I'm off the hennebeeto and a couple baddies out of Puerto Rico
[??] bottles, they like charizo
They don't like it clean, they rather hennebeeto
I'm off the hennebeeto
Swish
Larry making all the hits

[Verse 1: RJ]
Hop out at the liquor store, down south the corner store
New York, the bodega where you get your party favors
Strap on me plus I got the nose like a car payment
I ain't scared to spend it, fuck a image just to show our language
Shit, I just bought a bottle for everybody up in my whole squad
I told the plug to bring the pot for bitches who turn their nose up
Shit, said you wanna be famous, get rich, come lambo
Gotta get courageous, take a risk, go scramble
Niggas be hatin' with the hurt they can't channel
That's why I keep thirty on this bitch like rambo
Hennebeeto behind the counter by the Jack Daniels
And the amigos gon' keep it unless you handle your candle
Pressin' out your bitch, turn the living room to a scandal
Louis V sandals, pour me up mando

[Chorus: RJ]
I be off that hennebeeto, hennebeeto (I be off the Hennessy)
I be off that hennebeeto, hennebeeto (I be off the Hennessy)

[Post-Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Yo,Man, man them hoes ain't 'bout nothin' ('Bout nothin' eyy)
Man them niggas ain't nothin', man these bitches ain't nothin' (Eyy)
Man, man them hoes ain't 'bout nothin' ('Bout nothin' eyy)
Man them niggas ain't nothin', man these bitches ain't nothin' (Eyy)

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
I ain't trippin' on blood or crip
If hennebeeto what it is, then fuck it, it's lit
The whip skurt off on 'em, ain't no hoes here, nigga
You on my nuts more than hoes, you the popo, nigga
Crib got acres, the bank eight figures (shit)
Inni-mini-mo, then drive and speedin' (shit)
Jesus, if you turn, I left my thing in a closet
Grab it, cock it, protect the deposit
Yo, Henny got me lurkin' on the 'gram (On the 'gram)
Send me twenty bitches on the bull' (On the bull')
Tryna make a billion before I go (Before I go)
Flyest niggas walkin' through the door

[Chorus: RJ]
I be off that hennebeeto, hennebeeto (I be off the Hennessy)
I be off that hennebeeto, hennebeeto (I be off the Hennessy)
I be off that hennebeeto, hennebeeto (I be off the Hennessy)
I be off that hennebeeto, hennebeeto (I be off the Hennessy)

[Verse 3: RJ]
A lil' champagne with a Hennessy touch
Jumping off stage, they can't wait to meet us
I want my own phase but you still can get jumped
Jumpman on the J's, having Japanese brunch
Couldn't tell ya, Verbatim exactly how we did it
But every 90 days, the whole label swap cars
They Henny got me faded, all these chains bring commitment
Mr L.A. in these Bathing Apes stars
I'm in the the club in the A, we the drum in the K
We just flood out the bank, throwing dubbs celebrating
Independence, ain't no hating my premises
No, I got my plug on the way while you running in place
I'm just running the play, I want for your home girl to finish
She took a sip like what's in it, shit

[Chorus: RJ]
I be off that hennebeeto, hennebeeto (I be off the Hennessy)
I be off that hennebeeto, hennebeeto (I be off the Hennessy)
I be off that hennebeeto, hennebeeto (I be off the Hennessy)
I be off that hennebeeto, hennebeeto (I be off the Hennessy)

[Bridge: RJ]
Add a little Hennessy touch, hit it with a little bit of Hennebeeto
Add a little Hennessy touch, hit it with a little bit of Hennebeeto
Add a little Hennessy touch, hit it with a little bit of Hennebeeto
Add a little Hennessy touch, hit it with a little bit of Hennebeeto
Add a little Hennessy touch, hit it with a little bit of Hennebeeto

[Interlude]
Man: Now, I've done seen you starin in my glass, you tryna hit this hennebeeto or what?
Girl: What's Hennebeeto?
Man: That's the champagne with the Hennessy mix, You ain't from L.A.? If niggas be on it, niggas be lit

[Outro: RJ]
Add a little Hennessy touch, hit it with a little bit of Hennebeeto
Add a little Hennessy touch, hit it with a little bit of Hennebeeto
Add a little Hennessy touch, hit it with a little bit of Hennebeeto
Add a little Hennessy touch, hit it with a little bit of Hennebeeto
Add a little Hennessy touch, hit it with a little bit of Hennebeeto
