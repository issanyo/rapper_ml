[Verse 1]
Ah I reign supreme
40 with the 30 AK with the beam
Give you all I have cause I aim to please
I can say I'm fly but it's plain to see
Let me shine let me shine don’t be hating on me
I feed the block treat it like the salvation army
Sanitise the dirty money with the persian homie
I’m sanctified in this church with the burn on me
Can’t peel me off from these streets
I’m attached to this shit I match with this shit
Was gone away for a minute now I’m back to this shit
Right back and these niggas got them knees now
Acting like a nigga squeeze one down
I’m off the dark like it’s evening now
You’re the king in town you
Ain’t shit less your team is down
I ain’t shit less my team is round

[Pre-Hook]
We flex on these low lives
You gonna make me flex on the pork beef
Or maybe have to flex on these low lives
Fuck around have to flex on the pork beef

[Verse 2]
Ah I ask a question
At close range all of my things slick
I was always love what to claiming to be
Woke up with nobody should have stayed asleep
Ain’t no time ain’t no time don’t be hating on me
Lose your mind overtime tired of waiting on me
I pulled up burning gas from the hazy on me
She hit the back jab then she wrecked the homie
Can’t peel we away from these streets I’m a attached
I’m attached to this shit I match with this shit
Was gone for a minute now I’m back to this shit
Right back and these niggas you can breathe again
Pouring liquor in the streets again
You learn to channel where your demons live
Bleed up in here for a nigga that would need a bitch
She came with you who she leaving with

[Pre-Hook]
We flex on these low lives
You gonna make me flex on the pork beef
Or maybe have to flex on these low lives
You gonna make me fuck around have to flex on the pork beef

[Hook]
