[Verse 1: RJ]
Na I ain't tripping off the old hoes
It's getting late get the drink before the store close
I still got the camera on behind closed doors
They say they sisters but they kissing in the photos
Hoes getting gassed they just need a location
You be kissing ass nigga you be home caking
Hoes taking your cash they ain't making no payment
I need my shit fast bitch I'm running out of patience
Need a vacation, bitch you a trip
Shit always look better through a chain link fence
But where I touch home they ain't leave no print
Say you want me to change that ain't making no sense
And there's no brown nose and broken hearts and roses
My previous relation separate me from the old shit
I wipe my hands clean tell em mess around
Cause every next pick is a 2nd round
This new fame got my old hoes trippin
I don't pocket bitches and emotions is your decisions
I can do good on my own I'm different
Jordan still jump without givin

[Hook : RJ]
I ain't tripping of you no more
I done dropped you knock four
I could never be a fool for a ho I put that on my soul, my soul
On my mama I ain't tripping off you no more
I done dropped you knock four
I can never be a fool for a ho
I put that on my soul, my soul
On my mama I'm on ay

[Verse 2: RJ]
Na i ain't tripping off you
I could still walk without shoes
And they can make it clap with no hands
So they done made it into my plans
And they done brought friends from a friends
And we done turned it up to a 10
I'm getting no sleep once again
And we gone prolly do this shit again over and over
They don't need clothing and i don't need closure
Sex drive crazy like my dick need a chauffeur
Just keep an open mind when the dough show my
New fame got my old hoes trippin
I don't pocket bitches and emotions is your decisions
I can do good on my own I'm different
Jordan still jump without Pippen

[Hook: RJ]
I ain't tripping of you no more
I done dropped you knock four
I could never be a fool for a ho I put that on my soul, my soul
On my mama I ain't tripping off you no more
I done dropped you knock four
I can never be a fool for a ho
I put that on my soul, my soul
On my mama I'm on ay
