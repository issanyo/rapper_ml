[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type, nah
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like, woo
You ain't got no life, nah
Cups with the ice and we do this every night, hey
I ain't check the price, I got it
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like, woo
I'm just living life, hey, hey
And let my momma tell it, nigga, I ain't living right, yup

[Verse 1: RJ]
I got one foot in the street one foot in industry, I'm hopscotch
I shoot my seed in her face [?]
Labels on the line, chuckie want a 9
But I don't cut the price, cuz I don't cut the white
I treat my gasoline like a trampoline, and we jamboree with them hundreds
I got a caterpillar, a nigga cap a nigga
And get to butterfly about money
Screamin I be on my momma
I'm on the honor roll to them dollars
I feed them white pills, I live life and feel at least every bitch is my woman
Cuz nigga
