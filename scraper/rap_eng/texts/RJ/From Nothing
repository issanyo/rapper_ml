[Intro]
Keep in mind we don’t use no pins, no pad
No phones in my hands, uh
But, uh

[Verse 1]
When we was starving where was you at
Right now we don’t want to bargain I got you mass
In a matte black to back like a duplex
Brought some old habits to that newness
Niggas doing all this balling and I don’t shoot baskets
But lambs do, I bet it all when lambs shoot
We got the [?]
Bought hat new chain with random
Been making them plays for Atlanta
Get in my home one day if you stand up
Your homies always bitching
Don’t keep no code in Philly
Can’t stop my shine
If there wasn’t no sun there wouldn’t be no solar system

[Hook]
Bitches be grinding it’s a fact don’t wanna see where we going
Got that shallow mind but for sure she deep throating
She was playing it safe till I came to decode it
I throw my unit in the face and tell her free to speak on it
Now break it down, got bitches rolling up
We pass the drink around just to keep it going up

[Verse 2]
Make sure she old enough, don’t want no statutory
Just cause she push that pussy round don’t make it mandatory
Man up with that automatic, shit ain’t what it seem
Know people see me yeah, I think I’m Prince Hakeem
Keep my royal [duty clean/decree], I ain’t looking for no queen
Group of hunters on the scene, gotta boost my Josephine
Cause my rookies gotta eat
Like how we got it all from nothing
Got it all from nothing
We still grinding like we struggling
On my mama, I’m honest
I can check this pot when I’m bubbling
On my mama, we honest
Up the grind like we ain’t got nothing
Niggas got it all from nothing, uh shit
Niggas juggling outta nothing, uh
Some niggas is dying for nothing

[Bridge]
My niggas pull me out
I put my niggas out
Yeah we been putting out
Look how we putting out
I put my fingers out
They put their liquors out
Look how we putting out
Yeah we been putting out
Yeah let me use the trap
I bought my own sack
I bought my own sack
I bought my own sack
Yeah let me use the trap
I bought my own sack
I doubled on my sack
Then bought my own trap

[Hook]
Bitches be grinding it’s a fact don’t wanna see where we going
Got that shallow mind but for sure she deep throating
She was playing it safe till I came to decode it
Threw my unit in the face and tell her free to speak on it
Now break it down, now, now, now, now
Go ahead and break it down, oh, oh, oh, oh
And pass that drink around
