I hear them talk
I knock em off
They sleeping on me
That's pillow talk
I'm putting this verse in a coffin
I know I be doing it too often
These niggas ain't getting no options
I see that hating and blocking
I'm sonning these niggas adoption
Made a wave we ain't docking
Niggas hating but they watching

Fuck it
Watch us
They hating
That won't stop us
Why they
Doing it
These niggas
Ain't doing shit
Moving in from the avenue
Next house is in Malibu
They follow me they don't follow you
New house for my whole crew
These niggas ain't doing it doing it
These niggas at home with the bullshit
I'm turning that house to a mansion
I got that lil bitch and she dancing
These niggas is out of free chances
I'm killing shit like I'm Manson
They coming at me for the answers
I'm turning the house to a mansion

They high off that lean
That problem ain't me
This shit was a dream
I'm running this shit it's a small feat
Life is a bitch and that bitch sings
I'm changing the tone and the ring
These niggas need help
The realest they seen
Protecting my soul
These niggas gone leach
I climax this shit
They coming at me
It's that nigga Bknott doe
I took some shrooms and got a new life
Early morning with the late nights
We keep on going till it we name the price
My dreams are real
We gon get it all
Keep the grind and keep the grind and keep the overbite
Making moves never out of spite
When I see the signs I know we doing it right
I can fuck with them cowards
Them niggas lame with no powers ugh
Time was lost but now it's our's
10,000 fucking hours ugh
You niggas is hating
That's making me rich
That negative energy is making me sick
I'm getting that cheese when I'm talking that pic
Niggas is hating but all on my dick

Fuck it
Watch us
They hating
That won't stop us
Why they
Doing it
These niggas
Ain't doing shit
Moving in from the avenue
Next house is in Malibu
They follow me they don't follow you
New house for my whole crew
These niggas ain't doing it doing it
These niggas at home with the bullshit
I'm turning that house to a mansion
I got that lil bitch and she dancing
These niggas is out of free chances
I'm killing shit like I'm Manson
They coming at me for the answers
I'm turning the house to a mansion
