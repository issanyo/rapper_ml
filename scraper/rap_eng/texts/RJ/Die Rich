[Chorus: Splacc]
This one's for the bitches, that said I wasn't gonna be shit
Now look at the me bitch, riding in the new whips
Forever on some fly shit, money over all I'ma die rich
Show you how do this, big bands with a new crib
Fuck a old bitch I gotta new bitch
Asking how I'm doing, fuck you!
Keep it moving, now you want me cause you losing

[Verse 1: LesWood]
I just might pull up in a Panamera
It's money over everything I had to tell her
I don't know how to make it any clearer
I see a real nigga looking in the mirror
Hundred racks in the mattress we laid up
Bitch wanna change your life better praise us
She can't hide the drugs with no A cups
New bitch cause my old bitch played up
If she ain't talking money then she gotta go, I dont know
Head game good make the honor roll
RJ got them squares on the table like dominos
Fresh shit high mix the Gucci with the OMMIO
Oh shit, my momma tell you we on too
Fucking with them other niggers girl thats the wrong move
Heh, now she all up in my business
Had to do it for the bitches!

[Chorus: Splacc]
This one's for the bitches, that said I wasn't gonna be shit
Now look at the me bitch, riding in the new whips
Forever on some fly shit, money over all I'ma die rich
Show you how do this, big bands with a new crib
Fuck a old bitch I gotta new bitch
Asking how I'm doing, fuck you!
Keep it moving, now you want me cause you losing

[Verse 2: RJ]
They wanna hold me down
You just wanna slow me down
Now you wanna show me around
Bitch you better blow me, blow me
I'm leaving niggas lumpy over lump sums
Birds flocking all I dropped was a bread crumb
My favorite color Jay's is the red ones
Get down where you mad at a fair one
OMMIO jackets I'm taxing
Make sure all my niggas get a fraction
She got you but I got what you lacking
Don't get killed off fold niggas like a napkin
She used to give me cold shoulders, now she wanna chill
On [?] now bitch better go and get a feel
I feel like every real nigga stay on some fly shit
Fuck you I'm die rich, on god bitch!

[Chorus: Splacc]
This one's for the bitches, that said I wasn't gonna be shit
Now look at the me bitch, riding in the new whips
Forever on some fly shit, money over all I'ma die rich
Show you how do this, big bands with a new crib
Fuck a old bitch I gotta new bitch
Asking how I'm doing, fuck you!
Keep it moving, now you want me cause you losing
