[Intro]
Bring the OMMIO to your front yard
DJ Official

[Verse 1]
Bring this OMMIO to your front yard
10 Summers like a gun charge
Got it lit like without a blow torch
Who to feed a hoe for?
Oh, he official? He a dope boy
You ain't tuckin' Uchies in the Goyard
Where the fuck the dough goin'?
Shoot them gangstas MrLA
Extended state I woke up late
Remove my drapes and I see L.A
That's my shooter in the red lace
That's my shooter with them blue faces
LA's L-way, gunpowder in the shell case
Solid under interroga'
You should catch a fair fade
When they found me I was RJ
Yeah it's MrLA
Or it's Mister Motherfuckin'
Link me up in the London
Place politickin' man that distance change noth'
Fuck you mean? Humble bitch a man can't judge me
I'm known to make a bitch a trustee if she's lucky
Trust me, nigga

[Hook]
I don't love your bitch, she don't love me neither
We just fuck, we don't kiss, we get amnesia
I look my girl in her eyes, told her I'm a cheater
If you fuck another nigga I'ma have to leave

[Verse 2]
I became a god to a nonbeliever
Talk to God but I'm not your preacher
Did my time with some underachievers
Don't judge the crowd, got you on subpoenas
I got stripes like I own Adidas
Hit the lights with my own demeanor
Beat the odds, we survivin' without them features
50 thousand in deposit inside the Visa
Fuck up the closet find a spot for Designer sneakers
I'll come up for your job, fill in for your leisure
Bury me with the bleeder
Harvey Dent, theres two sides to these demons
Signed an agreement
Catch a body, double back like Jesus
Give you the whole magazine like Khadijah
Then get amnesia
Fuck the realest bitch, then get amnesia
I might need that but I don't need ya
And I won't feed ya
She just eatin' dick without the breather
Eatin' big, your appetite is a teaser
Trust me, nigga

[Hook]
I don't love your bitch she don't love me neither
We just fuck we don't kiss, I'm a real feeder
I look my girl in her eyes, told her I'm a cheater
If you fuck another nigga I'ma have to leave
Oou, I don't wanna have to leave

[Outro]
Oou, I'ma have to leave
Oh man, don't do it
Oh man, I don't wanna have to leave (DJ Official)
I don't wanna have to leave you
Uh, I need you
Yeah, oh no
Oh man
