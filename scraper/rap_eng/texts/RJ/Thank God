[Verse 1: RJmrLA]
I woke up, thank God I'm a real nigga
Niggas still throwin' shots at a still picture
And they still gettin' hot, can't chill with us
If this Glock all I got, then I'm Bill Withers
If I die, pray my pops is the gate keeper
Nigga slidin' with the opps, get the same treatment
In a beam got the Glock showin' state prison
Let me squeeze take the block, thats a gang missin'
Fake real niggas, how you revealin' the truth?
Make lil' niggas fake, but teach 'em to shoot
Threw the scope on the K, they easy to boost
You niggas lyin' on stage, to stay in the loop

[Hook: RJmrLA]
Stay with it, can't give it, nah nigga nah
Nah, nah nigga nah

Send them back to my whip grab that stick shit look gothic
And I thank my God all my pride ain't defrost me
