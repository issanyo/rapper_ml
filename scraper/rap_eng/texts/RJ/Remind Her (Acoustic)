[Intro: Eric Bellinger]
I know you want me, yeah, yeah
But it needs you
It's Eazy!

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
I know you've been workin' hard, you've been workin' harder
You know I've been on my job, I've been killin' them all
Take up so much of my time plus, you be on your grind but
I finished that early tonight so

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
I'ma come through with that reminder
I got it if you need it, a reminder
Yeah, I'ma remind you 'bout that swang
I'ma remind you 'bout my stroke
I'ma remind you that your body never felt this way before
I'ma remind you 'bout that shit that I've been doin' with my tongue
I'ma remind you I'm that nigga
I'ma remind you I'm the one
In case you needed that
In case you needed that
I know you're in need that
I gonna remind her

[Verse 2: RJ]
Remind you how foolish
But I want you to be
What a fool for me
When I pull up here
And side in your units
Give you all of me
'Til you fall asleep
Have you callin' me?
I might not always I.M.Y you with the whinny faces
But tonight, I'ma wine and dine you with the finest Aces
I get to kissin' all up on your spine, firmly grippin' the back of your thighs
Had to remind you why you fell deep for me
Ainâ€™t fit no category

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
I'ma come through with that reminder
I'ma come through, yeah, yeah
Be what you want, yeah, yeah
Get down on your knees, yeah, yeah
Like you finna pray, yeah, yeah
I got it if you need it, a reminder
Yeah, I'ma remind you 'bout that swang
I'ma remind you 'bout my stroke
I'ma remind you that your body never felt this way before
I'ma remind you 'bout that shit that I've been doin' with my tongue
I'ma remind you I'm that nigga
I'ma remind you I'm the one
In case you needed that
In case you needed that
I know you needed that

[Outtro]
Uh baby, uh baby
