[Chorus:]
I just might, I just might
Have a bank roll, now shit I just might
I just might, I just might
Buy a bag for your bitch shit I just might
I just might, I just might
Have it on me in the club shit I just might
I just might, I just might
Hundred bottles in the club shit I just might

[Verse 2:]
I just might fuck, I bet she let me
Fall back, can't show these niggas the recipe
I take the pussy from her but you take the bitches to Tiffany’s
Bank roll got it looking like I'm wearing skinny jeans
Came up from the bottom, now I got rich nigga problems
Foreign on both feet, my car don’t need a door key

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Out my lane nigga, use your blinker
Get your bitch to use her thinker
Had to hook, line and sink her
And I pull up clean as Virgin Mary's sex records
Pussy sweet as motherfucking bell peppers
Don’t tell her dope seller, nah nigga dope rap seller
Lean like tennis shoes on a fat fella
Count a million in a blindfold, the realest nigga I know
See a fine ho and I might with the dyno

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Hold up I just might do something with this old money
Stacking it so long it might got mold on it
I might her to ohh, she get no money
But I just might throw it
You done been f*cking up your rib, you might just go broke
I sold fam on the eagles I might just go long
I did loaners on me shit, might sniff out some trouble
It might just be legal out in Arizona
The plug went down need a pill
So the price went up on the pills
I might just leave these hoes with the bill
On my momma I’m on without a deal
I mean ya’ll understand, understand
Money on the mind, need mine in my hand
Seen her on the explore page, hit the DM
And it just might be your BM, On my mamma I

[Chorus]
