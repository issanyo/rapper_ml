If you really want me
Then why don't you show me
That you really need me in this way?
If you really hold me
If you really touch me
I know I can live for, and die for each day
I live for each day!
If you really wanna love someone
Would you really wanna live alone?
You gotta be strong to belong inside!
If you wanna feel like everyone
If you wanna go to Avalon
Cause I can live for, and die for each day
I wanna live for today!
I'm gonna live for, and live for love, oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna die for, die for love, oh, oh, oh
Listen to my heart and what it says
And in your arms I could love this way
Live for, and die for each day!
See, I'm new to the game
You're littin' like pressed your buttons
You're Mary to Jane, you're getting dirty to this
So get the casket, I need to make sure the suits are black
I don't care what it cracks
Question is
Will he shoot, will he cast?
See I'm in the game
But at the same time tryna stay out the lane
You can only give to
When you know you've gone through
The answer it speaks to love
Here I wanna be true, love is (?) on me and you
I know I can live for and die for each day
I live for each day
If you wanna feel like everyone
If you wanna go to Avalon
Cause I can live for, and die for each day
I wanna live for today!
I'm gonna live for, live for love, oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna live
I'm gonna die for, die for love, oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna die, die
If you wanna feel like everyone
If you wanna go to ever long
Cause I can live for, and die for each day
I wanna live for today!
Only your love can show me the way
Can lean on you, on you to stay
I can live for, and die for each day
If you really want me
Then why don't you show me
That you really need me in this way?
