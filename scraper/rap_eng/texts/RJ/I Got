Verse:1 (Smash)

I got kush, pills, cocaine
I'm In the whip and it's cocaine
And I'm riding through yo mothafuckin' domain
And I just kicked down a nigga door frame
Man I got gwoup, I'm cashed out
Fuck yo bitch then a nigga smash out
I hate these niggas that be runnin' they mouth
I don't like to talk I jus' pull that thang out
They call me young smash and everybody know me
Only 22 but I'm feeling like an OG
Fresh out on parole just smoked a whole OZ
You say you gettin' money, nigga you gon' have to show me
Yeah I took a loss fell off, then I bossed up
Sippin' on lean, I don't even really cough much
Never did a drive by, but I did some walk ups
Gangsters move in silence so nigga I don't talk much
They put me in the can I was still going HAM
And Nigga you ain't trappin' if you only selling grams
Young D Boy I came up on perham
I fuck with them killas, and I know the bird man (bird call)
I got swag ho, these niggas bummy
Since 14 I been gettin' to the money
Nigga I'm eatin' stuffin' up my tummy
Young go getter, I ain't ever been a dummy

(Course)
I got kush, pills, cocaine
I'm In the whip and it's cocaine
And I'm riding through yo mothafuckin' domain
And I just kicked down a nigga door frame
Man I got gwoup, I'm cashed out
Fuck yo bitch then a nigga smash out
I hate these niggas that be runnin' they mouth
I don't like to talk I jus' pull that thang out

(Verse:2 RJ)
(heeeeuy!)
Call me repo, take yo shit like it's legal
Kick in yo door, see my foot print by your peep hole
Oh, told my self way back when I don't need no deal
Cut corners with that coke, long as that codeine don't spill
I spit cocaine, worth more than your dope mang
Trap house got a line like soul train
How come these niggas claiming hoods that they don't bang
Ohh, you niggas fucking up your checks tryna hit rats
Bitch, run me yo taxes let me flip that
I see a miss match, ballin' off that bitch back
My zips fat as her kit kat, cause these contracts ain't giving out dougggghhh
I'm on some bossy shit, like I ain't ever have to ask a nigga
Toss me shit, Tryna learn how to whip, i done lost some splits
If you ain't born in it, never get involved with this, I got
