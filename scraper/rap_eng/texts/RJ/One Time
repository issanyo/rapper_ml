[Intro: Joe Moses]
I'on' be trippin' (hmm)
You a fool for this Official
Niggas know what it is (JM!)

[Verse 1: Joe Moses]
Make it rain on a stripper, what's the forecast? (what?)
CB4 nigga, straight outta the low cast (JM)
Play tag, and leave 'em sniffin' down the door mat
Pour Act' and treat a model bitch like a coat rack (what?)
Run it back from the corner, I was prime time
Fuck bars, this is facts, only grind time (JM)
No deal, no label, still high sign (Official)
I haven't thanked the man for the watch, this is God's diamond
Petite talk, new thot with a new mouth (what?)
Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, call it Juntao
Superstar but still hit 'em with the boom-pow
Fazed to the homies outside that's gettin' K'd down
Bustin' beat, like I'm straight outta the red side
Got a bitch but still a C with all that hair 'bout (what?)
My Crip bitch wanna see what all that red 'bout
Tell that bitch don't wear it, with my whereabouts
I been sellin' 'phetamines, bitch I'm dope pedalling
Got heroin, got percocets, got white girls, got ketamine (what?)
Got dick for some of these hoes who havin' dreams of the Fed
April Fools with that cash, had to cut off all my dreads (JM)
Tell the homies "let's go red", man dead, whoever said what they said
Would'a did a hunnid years for the gang, bitch I pledge
To the shit I represent, it ain't no secret (JM)
Professional with that beef, I ain't no vegan

[Hook: Joe Moses & RJmrLA]
Had to thank the Man upstairs one time
'Cause when I look around, I'm the only one shinin'
Patek cost a hunnid, this is all about timin'
'Cause when I look around, I'm the only one shinin'
I'm the only one shinin' (huhh, RJ)
I'm the only one shinin' (huhh)

[Verse 2: RJmrLA]
A rare form jumpin' out the dirt (a diamond)
Transformers dancin' on the shirt (a shinin')
A star's born when a sucker smirk
That's timin', what they gon' do when they finish with this verse?
Rewind it, I need my pointers set up like alignment
Jackie Joyner, I did the race with my crimie (with my crimie)
Deuce up, throw in yo' bitch' face like a liner (ohh)
She lookin' lost, I threw some weight in her vagina
Yeah yeah, hunnids on me, 132nd street (ohh)
Some niggas cut they self off, that's a vasectomy (ohh)
Told my son I'd help him with his own legacy (huh)
You ain't gon' shower without a star, showin' jealousy
Top off, peel back, that's the execution (oou)
Make a hunnid, makin' dollars not my resolution
Aimin' hammers at the camera but they never shootin' (rrrah)
That black Wraith park a revolution

[Hook: Joe Moses]
Had to thank the Man upstairs one time
'Cause when I look around, I'm the only one shinin'
Patek cost a hunnid, this is all about timin'
'Cause when I look around, I'm the only one shinin'
I'm the only one shinin' (huhh)
I'm the only one shinin' (uhh, huhh)
