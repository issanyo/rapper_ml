[Verse 1:]
I ain’t never been robbed
But I swear these rappers stealin' from me
Alls fails then its back trappin' wholesale
Gettin' booked, high risks need a nobell
Peace prize, heat high ring your door bell
Leave it all behind, like a coat tail
Yeah I feel a way
When niggas saying what, I’m sayin' how I say it, what the fuck I’m 'posed to say (fuck you)
Nigga fuck you
2Pac with the high top fade
You just sound like juice (like who, RJ)
You scratched and lied and you go by the beat
Rappers ain’t gotta, you just sound like me
And bitches can’t tell who is who, I get head with no roofs
Say excuse me and charge her a fee

[Hook]
Cause I be gettin' blue faced hunnids outta a Red Bones (red)
I be gettin' blue faced hunnids outta a Red Bones
OMMIO gang (OMMIO gang)
I be gettin' blue faced hunnids outta a Red Bones (red)
Watch me get them blue faced hunnids outta a Red Bones
OMMIO gang (OMMIO gang)
OMMIO gang

[Verse 2:]
You takin' from a nigga who ain’t got shit (got shit)
Runnin' with the style like I sponsored it (RJ)
Feelin' like you owe some kinda restitution
It's OMMIO the movement
I be like fuck what you thought, that’s what I think about it (RJ)
They steal your whole shit and they won’t blink about it (RJ)
Too many chefs, I don’t keep the kitchen crowded
Blue faced piggy, prolly paid to knock her candy outtie
Knock her, knock her truly
Yeah I know you want to see more of me
But I can never force it
I got my check, I’m not a checker for the team
Okay shout out light weight, sunset Jay
Lambs got us crackin', now its Mr. LA, from the villains to the bay
If they still sleepin' on me it’s the poor in 'em
Them rich bitches made it gold

[Chorus:]
Cause I be gettin' blue faced hunnids out a Red Bones (red)
I be gettin' blue faced hunnids out a Red Bones
OMMIO gang (OMMIO gang)
I be gettin' blue faced hunnids out a Red Bones (red)
Watch me get them blue faced hunnids out a Red Bones
OMMIO gang (OMMIO gang)
OMMIO gang

[Refrain]
OMMIO squad
OMMIO gang
OMMIO squad
OMMIO gang
OMMIO squad
OMMIO gang
OMMIO squad
OMMIO gang
OMMIO...

[Chorus:]
Cause I be gettin' blue faced hunnids inside a Red Bones (red)
I be gettin' blue faced hunnids inside a Red Bones
OMMIO gang (OMMIO gang)
I be gettin' blue faced hunnids inside a Red Bones (red)
Watch me get them blue faced hunnids inside a Red Bones
OMMIO gang (OMMIO gang)
OMMIO gang
