[Intro]
Yeah, RJ
OMMIO
Sometimes I get in this zone right
Lately i've been feeling like the realest nigga ever

[Verse 1]
Wear the gun like a outfit
Live by the sword, turnin' up with my down bitch
Niggas never see the bullet coming, that's a round kick
Lost my mind when the homie got found dead
That's some shit, I don't take shit but a trip
Got a hundred in the clip, trip, dump it in ya hip
Where the bitches, I'm lookin for the bitches
Seen so much shit man, it's hard to be religious
But I fear God hear alot when you fucked the whole cheer squad
Young nigga ballin', send shots, killer , tear drop
Get these hoes on deep, two 3's in a box
Do what I do, I shoot do-do-do-do
Airin' the fuck out this bitch
I get rough with a bitch
She cute but, she don't take enough of the dick
Ran through the whole clique, they all runnin' from the dick
Man, I pray my daughter never fall in love with a pimp
Baby, Karma is mug, and I done hurt so many people selling drugs
Yeah, i'm the plug
Got my heat up in the glove
So if she dancin' on me she know wassup, On my momma!

[Chorus]
Lately i've been feeling like the realest nigga ever
(Realest nigga ever, i'm the realest nigga ever) x2
Lately i've been feeling like the realest nigga ever
If i'm dancin on yo bitch then she feelin' my Baretta
Lately i've been feeling like the realest nigga ever
(Realest nigga ever, i'm the realest nigga ever)

[Verse 2]
Laser sights got me nocturnal
They say that what happen in the dark come to light sermon?
Better adapt, learn to react, don't get clapped, murdered
I put the tape on my mama, got my momma nervous
I'm observant
Watching niggas steal all my shit
Bitch left cuz there ain't no room on my dick
Re'd Up 2 told a nigga bout' a bitch
Now they tryna catch up, so they rappin like thiiiiiiisss
I make change, I ain't break a bill
Tell the label we need a label deal
She think it's love but its just a pill
Gave her the recipe, now she Mrs. Fields
I feel, like i'm the realest, eva-eva-eva, i'm the realest nigga eva
I feel, like i'm the realest, eva-eva-eva-eva, eva-eva
I was ....... this a scope on the rifle
Ran out of blunts, snatched another page of the bible, I know
In god we trust, on god we bust
And ain't nobody else like me, its obvious

[Chorus]

Outro
Lately, I feel like the realest ever
Lately, I feel the realest ever x2
