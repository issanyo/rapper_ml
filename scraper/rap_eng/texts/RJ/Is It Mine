[Intro]
Games
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
You know that I want it
Tell me how you want it
Gotta let me know sometime
Let me know what's on your mind
You know that I want it
Tell me how you want it
Gotta let me know sometime
Baby, don't waste my time
Is it mine? Let me know, whose is it? Whose is it?
Is it mine? Oh, whose is it? Whose is it?
Is it mine? Whose is it? Whose is it?
Is it mine? Huh, whose is it? Whose is it?

[Verse 1: RJmrLA]
Hit me when you choose up
Hit when you high or when you sober
Maybe we can both nut
And if we do this one time, it's for both of us
Baby, do you hear? Don't believe, I'm your friend, not an enemy
Chin to your knees, got you pimped off your pedigree
[?] SOP, every sin ain't a felony
Spend how we shoppin' how we spend once
I don't wanna waste no time, when I bang your line
It can be a FaceTime or a text
Babe, let me know what's on your mind, we can both save time
If you keep it 100, no chain gang bang
I been pullin' on your hair, yeah
I know you feel it when your eyes rollin' back, throw it back
I been drillin' everywhere, yeah
And then you wonder where we go, go next, on set, on the set

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & (RJmrLA)]
You know that I want it (You know that I want it)
Tell me how you want it (Tell me how you want it)
Gotta let me know sometime (Gotta let me know)
Let me know what's on your mind (On your mind)
You know that I want it (You know that I want it)
Tell me how you want it (Tell me how you want it)
Gotta let me know sometime (Gotta let me know)
Baby, don't waste my time

[Verse 2: RJmrLA]
You say this pussy for me
I gotta see if it's true
Oh, dive in it
See if anybody else got in it, I'm in it
Ooh, leave this position to me
We switch positions for you
Baby, let me show you what I'm blessed with
Beat it up until you get the message
Cleanin' up the messes
I like when you scream out who the best is
I ain't tryna press it
I just make investments
Started off at home, happy I dressed it
Still a YG but baby, listen, I'm a veteran
Waste no time when I bang your line
It can be a FaceTime or a text
Just let me know what's on your mind 'cause you been on mine
All day, I have you dreamin' 'bout sex
Safe sex, latex, ayy

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & (RJmrLA)]
You know that I want it (You know that I want it)
Tell me how you want it (Tell me how you want it)
Gotta let me know sometime (Gotta let me know)
Let me know what's on your mind (On your mind)
You know that I want it (You know that I want it)
Tell me how you want it (Tell me how you want it)
Gotta let me know sometime (Gotta let me know)
Baby, don't waste my time
Is it mine? Let me know, whose is it? Whose is it?
Is it mine? Oh, whose is it? Whose is it?
Is it mine? Whose is it? Whose is it?
Is it mine? Huh, whose is it? Whose is it? (Whose is it? Whose is it?)

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign & RJmrLA]
Is it mine in the morning?
Is it mine when I want it?
Is it mine when you need me?
Is it mine when you greedy?
Look, is it mine in the morning?
Is it mine when I want it?
Is it mine when you need me?
Is it mine when you greedy? (Is it mine 'cause I need it)
