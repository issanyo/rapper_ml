[Verse 1: RJ]
Gettin' rich though, she a trip though
Credit card with somebody else's info
I'm a blood, I been fuckin' on some crip hoes
And I been fuckin' up some commas, I'm a nympho
I got pistols in a rental
Put that shotty in your face out of impulse
Knock your body out the frame, make it centerfold
Another bird with my name in her twitter post
Shit, practice what I preach, cause I live what I speak
Bitch, we crackin' tonight
She don't wake up out her sleep, reach for you 'for she preview
Ain't mackin' her right
Look, I don't give these niggas work, cause they sniffin' their dope
And I don't take advice, if the nigga stay broke
Look, I don't mean I like you, cause I'm liking your posts
If I pipe and get ghost, that's just life

[Hook: RJ]
I ain't trippin' off hoes
I just want the dough out the bitch
Lil bitch, you's a nobody's bitch
I ain't trippin' off thugs
All across the globe, gettin' rich
You just puttin' on a show, you a lick

I ain't trippin' off hoes
I just want the dough out the bitch
Lil bitch, you's a nobody's bitch
I ain't trippin' off thugs
I ain't trippin' off thugs

[Verse 2: Choice]
It was April 23rd I had all my shit on the curb
Got released out that dirt cage, not one bird came
What was fucked up, took her mama out of debt
And when officer Nelson swept, she done slept with the next rap nigga
Then he flopped, so she pop up
Text that nigga, bitch
Y'all bill smaller then that Bushwick nigga, bitch
Million dollar contract, no more nigga rich
Stuntin' on your step, fuckin' with your ass
The follow with the bimbo
Her black box got a millionaire's info
She drove an Enzo, ain't buy it, it was tempt though
She wanna spoil me, I'ma let a nigga Jim Crow
Cubans are rolled, saying the least doing the most
Who's the joke, your bakery seats versus your quote
We say both, respect me, expect you can't accept me
I'm heavy, doin' better then any bitch (?)

[Hook: RJ]
I ain't trippin' off hoes

Lil bitch, you's a nobody's bitch
I ain't trippin' off thugs
All across the globe, gettin' rich
You just puttin' on a show, you a lick

I ain't trippin' off hoes
I just want the dough out the bitch
Lil bitch, you's a nobody's bitch
I ain't trippin' off thugs
I ain't trippin' off thugs
