Damn, girl, that ass look proper

[Verse 1: Mike Darole]
That booty talkin' to me
Imma talk back
She a ten in the face
And her body, goddamn
Yeah I got it, I'm the man now
Let me see you go on do it for that bag now
Back it, back it up girl reverse damn
You a pro, you ain't even need to rehearse
Make 'em all look twice when they see her
I'm finna pull up in that thang like skeet skirt
I go hard bitch, you're too soft
I do it proper with the roof off
Get your man he a goofball
I'm too sauced stickin' butter with it
If you got that from your momma then your mom can get it
Ayy, earthquake, make it vibrate
We could make a movie, yeah that's Lionsgate
I ain't got time baby why wait
Said I ain't got time throw it my way, like

Damn, girl, that ass look proper
Where she get it from?

[Verse 2: RJ]
Day-ya-ya-ya-yaum girl, hello
Ooh la la la, Carmelo
Talkin' to me fresh 'bout to Dream, Falsetto
Don't worry bout them bitches in your ear, that's the devil
Slap it on your box, you's a booty pill popper
Word around, momma was a, grandma was a poppa
If the apple fall far from the tree, that's cider
If I ever met a woman like me, me either
Okay, okay on me
Rotate, that way on me
Heard you don't do it but we gon' see
Mr. LA I'm a street [?]
I can tell the future lookin' at behind you
You's a kama sutra talking to her proper
Heard you got it from your momma like a hand me down
I get inside ya, learn my way around

[Chorus: Mike Darole]
Damn, girl, that ass look proper
Where she get it from?
She got it from her momma
That booty talkin' to me
Girl, hello
That booty talkin' to me
Girl, hello
Damn, girl, that ass look proper
Where she get it from?
She got it from her momma
That booty talkin' to me
Girl, hello
That booty talkin' to me
Girl, hello

[Verse 3: Compton AV]
It don't get no colder than us three
Every time a nigga ever showed, the hoes rushed me
They saying I'm the nigga from the city, I must be
If Miko don't trust you, I'mma shoot, you can trust me
And I'm right back crackin' like a [?]
If I feel myself fuckin' your bitch imma go viral
Blowin' money fast like a nigga hit the lotto
Get money, fuck bitches nigga, same old motto
Nigga, who dat? Nigga, nigga who dat?
Pull up in that foreign all black with the roof back
Nigga put 6's on the Phantom, how you do that?
'Cause nigga I'm that nigga my nigga, I thought you knew that
I be touchin' money like a ca-shier
Bitch throw that ass back and bring that ass here
Now drop it to the floor and make it wiggle like jello
Now bitch take my dick out my pants and say hello

[Chorus: Mike Darole]
Damn, girl, that ass look proper
Where she get it from?
She got it from her momma
That booty talkin' to me
Girl, hello
That booty talkin' to me
Girl, hello
Damn, girl, that ass look proper
Where she get it from?
She got it from her momma
That booty talkin' to me
Girl, hello
That booty talkin' to me
Girl, hello
