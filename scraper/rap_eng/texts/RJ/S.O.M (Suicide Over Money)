[Intro]
This swag shit
(Laughter)Too much on my plate
Ya feel me?
Look up
(Nigga dats the truth)

[Verse 1: Frank Brown]
Money is the motive
I'm a True Survivor
It's a difference
Between truth and liars
I'm the best
Fuck who's ya idol
Rappers get broke
Turn Suicidal
I ain't trying to do that
I came from nothing
Lookin' at the moon
Always gazed on something
Acid made me think
Molly made me change
Shrooms is my soul
Money ain't a thang
Would ya sell ya soul for this life (ok)
People on this earth
They think they got it right
Most bragging bout they cash
Even plus they boarding flights
No disrespect to Robin Williams
Ya heard about him right (R.I.P)
Ok i'm trippy
Yes really trippy (ok)
Watch the window for the cops
So they don't get me
(Oh ya i'm fresh)
Bitch, Fonzworth Bentley
They smoking all this reefer
I be blazing
I be looking like a chimney
I'm just speaking music (ya)
Don't get it, it's fine (ya)
I'm not like all these others rappers (ok)
I don't flex
I ain't Lying
And every nigga wanna talk
I had my chance, bitches funny
Wanna talk i'm really lucky
Suicide Over Money
(yep, yes sir, woah (laughter))

[Bridge]
The money
Always running for the money
Always want the money

[Verse 2: RJ]
Suicide Over Money
Thats S.O.M
Life is a game
Called an M.O.M
And if ya wonder bout the flow
It's Mac Meezy inspired
Heavy like d
Giving the world that micheal jordan
D-fence-less
Reckless
Kids
Meeting money in open casket funerals
Few to roll, few to sale
The mindset is always to get the trees please
Getting paper that evaporated faster than the doubters
Cash rule everything around me
Bitch please
I see the all seeing eye
Opening up for me
Meteors burn up in this atmosphere
This sun here
Rose up in the east
Least of all
Do i happen to Fall
I windfall through all the clouds
To a pile of that moss
The fam tall, and of course
That object that was the source
Of affection in paid in full
Affected by nothing
K.K.G
Nothing from something
More knowledge than Sumter
Wonder if the stars know
They been crossed in the hairs
The coronation finally here
Took shrooms, and lost my grip
Grappling with myself
If I should say if I'm the best
Or not, but I might as well
So to put the nine to my chest
And save everybody
