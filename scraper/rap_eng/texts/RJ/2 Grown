[Intro]
Bitch we too grown for games
Y'all too on to play
I left the roof on today

[Verse 1]
She said all I ever wanted was
Just to be a real one
One I can spend one, trust to depend on
You ain't gotta spend long looking for a real don
Baby let me take you from here no pilgrim
Walked up in the room spotlight got 'em deer dumb
Haters come in twos, ice flooded in my ear drums
You was feeling used ex dude can't depend on
Still you have it cool good views on the pier rise
Breaking all the rules but I'm fixing all your bruises
I can get your groove back like we in a movie
Shopping up the states introduce you to my jeweler
Moving all your weight out the way
Move it way out the way

[Hook]
Bitch we too grown for games
Y'all too on to play
I left the roof on today
Tennis shoes on display
But I'm too on to play
Bitch I'm too grown for games
I'm too on to play
Too out, too lit, too grown, to play, the games you play
Bitch I'm too grown for games
Too out, too lit, I mean too on to play the games
I'm too grown for games

[Verse 2]
It ain't over
All these blue hundreds on me looking loca
Bend about the waist like its yoga
Hold up a unit in your face call it close up, yeah yeah
Playing side bitches to the left, let you know its real
Find time to escape and enjoy the ville
We fuck more and say less till we show and tell
Champagne with the steak and a morning pill
Left the roof up, flat top, crew cut
Flat back brought it back out like a new butt
Scratch that, add a tax to this new drug
I'm too on for the groupie lovie, forreal

[Hook]
Bitch we too grown for games
Y'all too on to play
I left the roof on today
Tennis shoes on display
But I'm too on to play
Bitch I'm too grown for games
I'm too on to play
Too out, too lit, too grown, to play, the games you play
Bitch I'm too grown for games
Too out, too lit, I mean too on to play the games
I'm too grown for games
