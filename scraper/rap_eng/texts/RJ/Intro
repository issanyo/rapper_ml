[Intro]
Hi RJ
When you coming out of the studio?
You act like you live over there in that studio
I haven't seen you in a bout a week
I mean I'm proud of you, but hey!
I know you busy
But when you get a chance, call me
And another thing, I'm tired of making appointments to see Rain
That's my grandbaby
That's not how I raised you, and family is everything
Anyways, give me a call when you get this message
