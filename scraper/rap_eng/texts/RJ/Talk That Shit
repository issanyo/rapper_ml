[Hook: IamSu!]
And I ain’t eva gonna stop ballin’
I hustle like I’m still at rock bottom
I’ll show ya how I work my wrist
They love it when I talk that shit
And I ain’t eva gonna stop ballin’
I hustle like I’m still at rock bottom
I’ll show ya how I work my wrist
They love it when I talk that shit

[Verse 1: Iamsu!]
I’m grinding gotta make that cake
Got bank, yeah, love to spend, but I’d rather make
It’s HBK we don’t play, we don’t hate
We don’t like when rap niggas act fake
Maybe cuz they hoes I can take
All this California smoke outta state
Smoke sum, fuck some, I’mma break a bone
Puerto-Rican bitches like I’m singing reggaeton
And she gon’ pick up when I run her phone
Ass so good, made me sing a song
Uh, they wanna know what I’ve been thinkin’ on
Wanna know what I’ve been smokin’, I’ve been drinkin’ on
Henn, Jack Cartier, pour a lil green, I’mma smack that ass
You a lame nigga tryna jack the swag
You wanna know, then I’mma teach you, take you back to class

[Hook: IamSu!]
And I ain’t eva gonna stop ballin’
I hustle like I’m still at rock bottom
I’ll show ya how I work my wrist
They love it when I talk that shit
And I ain’t eva gonna stop ballin’
I hustle like I’m still at rock bottom
I’ll show ya how I work my wrist
They love it when I talk that shit


[Verse 2: King Trell]
Bitch running like the cops calling
Ghetto nigga, couple hundreds, I’m forever balling
She love the way I swerve that shit
High fluent, got rich, and I still go a crip
Uh, FLK make ya ass shake
Fresh new 600, it’s a drag race
Got big ole bricks and this sassey
When it’s time to eat, I’mma show her how the cash stake
Put the 50s on my last day, I be get it on the afflacke
With my niggas I'mma pass cake
We gon’ spend and get the mass straight
Called a lawyer, same one beat the last case
Uh, all my niggas ball like draft day
Beat ball, niggas be sleepin’
All my niggas whif ball, whips need green card
Street fall, can’t nobody ball like we ball
Nigga!

[Hook: IamSu!]
And I ain’t eva gonna stop ballin’
I hustle like I’m still at rock bottom
I’ll show ya how I work my wrist
They love it when I talk that shit
And I ain’t eva gonna stop ballin’
I hustle like I’m still at rock bottom
I’ll show ya how I work my wrist
They love it when I talk that shit
