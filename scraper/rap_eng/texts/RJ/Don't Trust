[Hook]
I don’t trust I don’t trust you
It’s hard to believe you ain’t carry for fun
Sometime I wonder if my name were my name
Would you fuck  with me the same
Oh man I want to know
Who are these strangers portraying as friends
Tell me what’s your purpose tell me why you here
I don’t trust I don’t trust you

[Verse 1]
Half of you niggs want to be the man just because
But first you keep it silent next thing your cheep love
A bottle in my problem and pour
A little liquor for my dead partners
But keeping honest with myself and my riders
Fuck yeah I’m a lie to that nigga
I’m a God to that nigga
We must get it right we going to silent that nigga
This is an army of movement I die for that nigga
We still pull each other cars shit with ourselves first shit
Now I check myself before the sheriff check
Cause streets ain’t no place for a young male
But I don’t feel safe with you unless you been there

[Hook]
I don’t trust I don’t trust
It’s hard to believe you ain’t carry for fun
Sometime I wonder if my name were my name
Would you fuck with me the same
Oh man I want to know
Who are these strangers portraying as friends
Tell me what’s your purpose tell me why you here
I don’t trust I don’t trust

[Verse 2]
I feel like niggas only come around when there’s been a fish
Bee the niggas that you make relevant
Be the nigga that turn against you
Cause a nigga for themselves at the end of it
Niggas get your help and they dissing you in public
I been knocking down barriers for little niggers
Had to show a way for a real killer
Drill on my head on the life sentence
Black Ks with a knife in it
I don’t trust a nigga or a bitch
Cameras in their portrait
Signing pictures at these niggas
Seeing your pictures be the one to pick you out
As a cold offended so for now I’m ignoring these  niggas

[Hook]
I don’t trust I don’t trust
It’s hard to believe you ain’t carry for fun
Sometime I wonder if my name were my name
Would you fuck with me the same
Oh man I want to know
Who are these strangers portraying as friends
Tell me what’s your purpose tell me why you here
I don’t trust I don’t trust
I don’t trust I don’t trust
I don’t trust I don’t trust
I don’t trust I don’t trust
It’s hard to believe you ain’t carry for fun
Sometime I wonder if my name were my name
Would you fuck with me the same
Oh man I want to know
Who are these strangers portraying as friends
Tell me what’s your purpose tell me why you here
I don’t trust I don’t trust
