Feel like this elephant up in the room
It take an elephant to fill my shoes
It’s best you make your next step, your best move
So I can never change what I been through
I throw three fifty she throw back some blues
We sippin Remy while we selling juice
All got the [?] sill high powered tools
Let off this fifty and bring out the news

[Pre-Hook]

Must be an elephant up in the room
It take an elephant to fill my shoes
It’s best you make your next step, your best move
So I can never change what we’ve been through

She got a lick for me I cannot lose
We sippin Remy while we selling juice
All got the [?] sill high powered tools
Let go of this fifty and bring out the news
We come from danger, danger, danger, danger, danger
