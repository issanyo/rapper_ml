[Verse:]
Ever since I was thirteen
My biggest problem has been just to
Find the right road to that rainbow
That everybody talks about
You know most people get close enough
To count the stripes
But they don’t have enough guts
To reach out
And take that pot of gold
And what are you going to do?
I’m going to walk out with the whole thing
You gonna share that with anyone?
There’s a possibility
I might share that
With a little lady I just met
It’s not gonna be easy though baby
It’s not gonna be easy
It’s gonna be hard work
