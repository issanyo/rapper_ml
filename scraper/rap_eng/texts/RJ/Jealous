[Hook: RJ]
Niggas ain't care when I wasn't shit
Now a nigga on now they on dick
(x4)

[Verse 1: RJ]
You a shoulda coulda woulda ass nigga
I'm a wish a nigga would on the hood ass nigga
Go and ask the last nigga, reach for the strap quicker
Sip the gat nigga, feed a nigga like a fat nigga
Boy I bet right back on a 10 to 4
Bitch blow my dice 'fore i'm finsta roll
Niggas running out of money try and bet your belt
You done lost your rent can't help yourself
What you telling me, fuck you mean
Beam on your jelly bean
Medellin, motherfuckers fiend, methamphetamine
Ghetto king, I can do some things with the triple beam
Bada-bing, if she wanna leave gotta let her leave
Let me do my job girl don't make it easy for me
In the morning make my exit now shes chasing for me
R motherfucking J
Knock another bitch while I'm on a date
Do that make you jealous?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: AD]
They hate me when I was down
Now they hate me because I'm on
These hoes use to turn me down now they all say I do them wrong
Pockets use to be on E now my money getting long
Same niggas yelling out fuck me the same ones banging my song
It's that c-c-c-compton I don't gotta fucking stutter
Give a fuck about a hater all about my bread and butter
Take after my old man, you be bitching like your mother
You be snitching undercover, grab that whip and we burn rubber
On you fuck niggas, swear to god I barely trust niggas
Always got the burner but don't ever fucking bust nigga
Lying about your whip, still sitting on the bus nigga
Lying on your dick, not a pimp you a cuffed nigga, aye
Man I swear that I hate ya'll
[?], knock his face off, let a case off like
Cuz, ain't no bluffing around here
If you scared get the fuck around here
That's why they jealous
