[Intro]
It's just motivation, motivation

[Verse 1]
Sheesh!
Gonna run a chopper like a lease
Extension hanging from it I got reasons
I'm just tryna keep my niggas out the streets
I got, bombers, T-Shirts
Hoes look me up like research (yeah)
Bouncing off of walls that's a reverb (yeah)
Answer all my calls on speakers (Hello?)
Imma need some tables on reserve
Cuz I just dropped a tape with no features
I can do a favor not a free verse
Spilling champagne on my speakers
Tried to [?] paint but it re burned
Body for body Ferrari ignition
Spotted them barnies i'm guarded with pistols
[?] your body regarding your issues
Everything you say is held against you

[Pre-Hook]
If I told you what I saw you'd tell a vision
That's my premonition
I can show you what I ball with all this ambition
I got ambition

[Hook]
I just passed for a hunnid y'all can preach 'em
Tell 'em rush it all back Imma run it up run it up
I just passed for a hunnid y'all can preach 'em
Tell 'em rush it all back Imma run it up run it up

[Verse 2]
I run it up in the ground just like a downee
Don't fuck around with you clowns I rather count these
The Ice flooded I drown bitches around me
And looking for no attention that's how she found me
Run it back, run a lap, fuck it running that
Lift the trunk and the front I train the [?]
Burn a plan, I'm killing tracks, sure that's murdering
Now point it out on the map cuz I ain't heard of that
I keep my head on the swivel like i'm possessed a little
30 all in the middle cuz I finesse the dribble
They tried to cross me like a X [?]
But getting gwop on my jeans that's that paper dental

[Pre-Hook]
If I told you what I saw you'd tell a vision
That's my premonition
I can show you what I ball with all this ambition
I got ambition

[Hook]
I just passed for a hunnid y'all can preach 'em
Tell 'em rush it all back Imma run it up run it up
I just passed for a hunnid y'all can preach 'em
Tell 'em rush it all back Imma run it up run it up

[Bridge]
Imma run it up run it up
Imma run it up run it up
I just passed for a hunnid y'all can preach 'em
Tell 'em rush it all back Imma run it up run it up

[Pre-Hook]
If I told you what I saw you'd tell a vision
That's my premonition
I can show you what I ball with all this ambition
I got ambition

[Hook]
I just passed for a hunnid y'all can preach 'em
Tell 'em rush it all back Imma run it up run it up
I just passed for a hunnid y'all can preach 'em
Tell 'em rush it all back Imma run it up run it up
