Now fuck the silencer, I'm shooting through the pillow
And if the door locked I'm jumping through the window
I might be wrong but I ain't tryna work a 9 to 5
So if I gotta sell these pills, I'mma sell them hot
Go get your business straight or renovate a condo
Ratchet bitches whipping chicken like a rascal
Niggas face tatted like'and Bosco
In my city niggas judging for what you got, homes
And we from Atlanta'getting rich, though
'getting money like what they hidden for
Follow code, gotta value morals and principle
Niggas acting like they pimps but they pay the bitch
Some of us ain't in a position that we say we in
In one year I had to move in three residence
I fell asleep and woke up in a new Mercedes Benz
Niggas wanna shine with me
But they won't do the time with me
Snitches throw they time to me
That's why I always ride low key
I don't want a dime on me
Snitches throw they time to me
That's why I always ride low key
I gotta keep the fire on me
You making shit more complicated than it should be
Industry makers be clicking what the hood be
Record me fucking your bitch and let my hood see
'Cause I be banging the hood when I'm in her pussy
Oh, motherfucking bitch, bring my shit back
Fuck her on the flip with a clover leaf tack
Running off the lip, I'm off the hip like rrra
Hold up, rrra, rrra, rrra, rrra, rrrra
And all these new niggas tryna join the team now
Cherry picking, bitch nigga get a rebound
No chameleon but I'm going through some changes
'Cause those that I help get famous don't see now
AK 47, 7 trays, lot of clips like I'm tryna make the VMAs
Oh, J do my dirt on the low 'cause what they don't know don't show my momma
Niggas wanna shine with me
But they won't do the time with me
Snitches throw they time to me
That's why I always ride low key
I don't want a dime on me
Snitches throw they time to me
That's why I always ride low key
I gotta keep the fire on me
Gotta keep the fire on me
In case they wanna ride on me
Why they wanna dine on me
Same nigga be mad then chime with me
They want a nigga with everyone
Pushing a nigga with everyone
Real ass nigga from day one
Niggas wanna shine with me
But they won't do the time with me
Snitches throw they time to me
That's why I always ride low key
I don't want a dime on me
Snitches throw they time to me
That's why I always ride low key
I gotta keep the fire on me
