[Verse 1:RJ]
Give me all the pretty bitches
Guns with extensions
Getting more attention, all this heat change ya pigment
Hottest rapper out, blew hundreds is my description
In the mirror I see money, I got Ben Franklin descendants
Buzzing off bangin, then became a club favorite
Hoes wonder what my name is now, just tell them famous
R mutha fuck it, soft White Russian
Coke linger in my finger nails
Push it through the the PDL's
On my way to see the hoe, that I use to know
No liscence so I'm creeping as usual
Down the back block where it ain't safe for you to go
Only thing promised is a bag and a funeral
Niggas say I'm one hit away from being super on
But if your waiting for a commercial watch the Super Bowl
I be on what snoop is on
Back when gin and juice was on
Murder was the case, roof gone like a superdome
I be on the same ol shit lil boosie on
Niggas want the fade, I'll clip em send my shooters home
Nigga on the front line
You should make the front page
Niggas getting outta line, check em like a update
I ain't got a deal, lil e need an appeal
I'm like fuck that little money u owe me nigga Fareal
Yelling free all my real ones
Rest in peace tiny M, I'm
Hear a nightmare whenever I'm behind the wheel
My Heart goes out to Brenda bless her soul
N them kids they got to grow
Knowing there parents are gone
Nsaw shawty give my side panel
Red Versace flannel
I don't cuff these hoes unless it's ferragamo
I just bust reload, we come with heavy ammo
I'm mad I scuffed my 4's, had to handle my candle
Won't get stuck in a scandal
Saddle up in that new lambo
Life a gamble, hoes don't know me llamo
They just know I scramble
I just "?" hear these snakes raddle
See yo homies shadow
News say my nigga dead
I couldn't do nothing but change the channel
Cause I didn't want to shed another tear so I just changed the channel
Live and die up in these streets
They school me like my nigga nano
