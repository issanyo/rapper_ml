[Hook 1]
50 bands when I'm walking out
Got the .50 cal when I'm walking out
They don't frisk me down 'cause I'm balling out
Give me 50 bands or I'm walking out

[Verse 1]
50 bands when I'm marching out
Them new strips they be hard to count
They stick together when it's large amounts
We gone fuck the streets do it doggy style
400 more summers now OMMIO had to bust it down
They was sleeping on us turned Pacquiao
Like a Houston game brought the Rockets out
LA where the fuck you at?
ATL where the fuck you at?
New York where the fuck you at?
Detroit where the fuck you at?

[Hook 2]
50 bands when I'm walking out
Got the .50 cal when I'm walking out
They don't frisk me down 'cause I'm balling out
Knock your bitches down swear thats all about

[Verse 2]
I told karma if I pay for it just bring me back my change
This .40 on me like leg warmers help me run the shit I'm Usain
My new bitch she don't know me know me
But I knocked her off my name
Down south back to South Central, I swear they all the same
New Orleans where the fuck you at?
Bay Area where the fuck you at?
I'm in your city where the function at?
I told her don't forget where I fucked you at

[Hook 3]
50 bands when I'm walking out
Got the .50 cal when I'm walking out
They don't frisk me down 'cause I'm balling out
I need 50 now when I'm walking out
