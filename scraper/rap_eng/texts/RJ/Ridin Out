[Intro]
Yeah, it’s another late one
Or early one, should I say
Keep the KK roll
T-T-O-D
Gangstas don’t sleep
Yeah, man I don’t care let me talk my shit one time
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I’m from the west side real niggas stolen them set side
Bitches like these Benzes need to call when I can test drive
RIP to Left Eye, no TLC
Ya’ll just really let them text fly
Who got the scare from Best Buy
Always been a hustler, smooth, cool motherfucker
Real thirsty when I’m thirsty
Tacavaca with the paccas, never been a sucker
40 in the stash, kicking like Jackie Chang, Rush Hour, Chris Tucker
Lot a rebels talk the talk but they be hella faking
And you’ll never see around once they ever vacant
I was raised by the cheese if you serious face it
Cause when it’s on hood it’s scary movie, Freddy-Jason
Here now and they won’t take my seat
Can’t nobody contend now when I make my heat
I used to hit the club with them fake ID’s
Now my bitch open my phone cause of face ID

[Hook]
You can catch me ridin out
Pulling up, kill, hand on the kill real
You can catch me ridin out
Down that spitch by my side you can get a thrill
You can catch me ridin out
Diamonds n my neck but I ain’t got  no chill
You can catch me ridin out
I’m a gansta, gansta, gangsta, gansta
You can catch me ridin out

[Verse 2]
Aye, red blood cold yard over fresh preys
Sauced up blammas bruising up my rib cage
Stars in the ceiling shining on my space J’s
Killer California ain’t no place to vacate
Niggas break safe to save face make your fate way
Haters tugging on my dick like a shake way
If it ain’t gorilla glue then it’s KK, AK’s and AKA’s aye
I’m a make it one day
I done worked all week till it’s Friday
And woke up to a Sunday
Yeah I been smoking at the pound since the chronic
Nigga now it’s KK and these hunnids got you niggas acting violent
You don’t want this gun play cause I’m a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta

[Hook]
You can catch me ridin out
Pulling up, kill, hand on the kill real
You can catch me ridin out
Down that spitch by my side you can get a thrill
You can catch me ridin out
Diamonds n my neck but I ain’t got  no chill
You can catch me ridin out
I’m a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
You can catch me ridin out

[Verse 3]
Breaking bitches for the bred told em meet me in bed
Don’t kick her out I want breakfast instead
Don’t trust these niggas they might be the Feds
I’m always beast up to head
It’s in my skin Taylor Gang till I’m dead
I ain’t stressed cause all I want’s the pay
Make a hundred grand blow a hundred points today
Man these niggas think they better but they not
If I drop a  song today that better gon be hot
It’s with me on the plane
Catch me cruising up the West Side, Pittsburgh
Nigga got it tatted on my chest
The money still green the bitches still calling
My music still rock my niggas still balling
Make another 5 mil just off touring
You niggas all sound the same the game getting boring
Keep the KK stashed and paned in the glass
You can hear me when I pass

[Hook]
You can catch me ridin out
Pulling up, kill, hand on the kill real
You can catch me ridin out
Down that pitch by my side you can get a thrill
You can catch me ridin out
Diamonds n my neck but I ain’t got  no chill
You can catch me ridin out
I’m a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
You can catch me ridin out

[Verse 4]
Me and you
Smoking on a pound or two
Riding in my whip to the stove
For some papers cause they already roll
Me and you
Smoking on a pound or two
Riding in my whip to the stove
For some papers cause they already roll

[Hook]
You can catch me ridin out
Pulling up, kill, hand on the kill real
