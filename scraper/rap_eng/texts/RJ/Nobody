[Intro]
Cold rich nigga seen both sides
We just tryna reinvent it like a nose job
Mustard on that beat, hoe

[Verse 1]
I ain't ever take no shit from nobody
Hoppin' off flights with my whole posse
In a hot pool with a cold thotty
Chain send chills through her whole body
She don't like me, then she lost like yee
Got a hunnid G's, then she know about me
Still wearin' clothes from the early 90's
Wear my Chuck T's, I been rockin' all week
Tryna keep up with everybody I know
Tend to lose touch when you get around the globe
Releasin' all my hair, let it fall up on the floor
I can pay a grant with the cash I throw

[Hook]
I ain't ever take no shit from nobody
I ain't finna take no shit from nobody (nobody)
Bein' on that fake shit, no not me
Ain't gotta see her face, but I know her body, (nobody)
I ain't gotta take shit from nobody
Momma said don't take no shit from nobody, (nobody)
Bein' on that fake shit, no not me
I ain't ever take no shit from nobody (nobody)

[Refrain]
Cold rich nigga seen both sides
Nobody
We just tryna reinvent it like a nose job
Nobody

[Verse 2]
Tell me one more time baby lemme let 'em know
Make 'em come alive, where them dead guys go
They be shady from the side, but my squad don't go
In her face she a dime, everybody I know
Know I keep it real

[Hook]
I ain't ever take no shit from nobody
I ain't finna take no shit from nobody (nobody)
Bein' on that fake shit, no not me
Ain't gotta see her face, but I know her body, (nobody)
I ain't gotta take shit from nobody
I ain't finna take no shit from nobody (nobody)
Bein' on that fake shit, no not me
I ain't ever take no shit from nobody (nobody)

[Refrain]
Cold rich nigga seen both sides
Nobody
We just tryna reinvent it like a nose job
Nobody...
Nobody...
Nobody...
Nobody...
Nobody...

[Hook]
I ain't ever take no shit from nobody
I ain't finna take no shit from nobody (nobody)
Bein' on that fake shit, no not me
Ain't gotta see her face, but I know her body, (nobody)
I ain't gotta take shit from nobody
Momma said don't take no shit from nobody, (nobody)
Bein' on that fake shit, no not me
I ain't ever take no shit from nobody (nobody)

[Outro]
Nobody...
