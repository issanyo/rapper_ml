[Intro]
Oh my god
Fuck yo baby mama she a bop
Fuck yo baby daddy he a bop
Oh my god, oh my god
Why these lame niggas say what they not
Oh my god, oh my god
Spillin' Ace throw a bird off the yacht
Oh my god, oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god, au devoir (it's my job)
Oh my god, au devoir
Oh my god, oh my god

[Verse 1]
10k get you domed at your job
20k for a show au devoir (it's my job)
We just made us a play, what's the plot?
Pour four ounce of cocaine in that pot
Cop them Balmains and throw out my Robins
Did a show in my draws it was popping
Fuck yo baby mama she a bop
Fuck yo baby daddy he a bop
I'm so influential for my cul-ture
Got a razor blade to cut the dope-up
They don't catch no fades they just throw subs
Got some kids to raise nigga grow-up

[Hook]
No disruptions in here, nor assumptions to fear
We just function in here, au devoir
I'm so blessed in the ear, and my neck chandelier
I'm so blessed to be here, oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god
Fuck yo baby mama she a bop
Fuck her baby daddy he a bop
Fuck yo baby mama au devoir

[Verse 2]
Got the drum that's hanging from the pistol
Where I'm from a gun is your credentials
Niggas dying young is fundamental
Charge it to the game for incidentals
On the move nigga bangin' and a activist
Fuck the news these is gangland practices
Some niggas made it cleaning cribs flipping mattresses
I bet I bring Taylor Swift where them Athens is

[Hook]
No disruptions in here, nor assumptions to fear
We just function in here, au devoir
I'm so blessed in the ear, and my neck chandelier
I'm so blessed to be here, oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god
I'm so blessed to be here, oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god
I'm so blessed to be here, oh my god
Au devoir, au devoir
Oh my god, oh my god
Fuck yo baby mama she a bop
Fuck yo baby daddy he a bop
Au devoir, au devoir
Oh my God, I'mma god
I'm so blessed to be here, oh my god
I'm so blessed in the ear au devoir
Au devoir
Oh my god, I'mma god
