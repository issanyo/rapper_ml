( I mean , I see us in the next ten summers , next five years . Probably being the richest niggas ever . This shit bigger than life . Ommio music the label )

RJ:

Uh look , Loose lips sank ships like an iceberg
Learned how to pimp reading iceberg
I was just a rook with the hard work and I caught a jug on the soft syrup
Learned how to cook from a lifer and I don't remember last night it's a bright burr
Motivated by the thugs in the same boat
Intimidated by the love so they hate more

Hook:
New bitch , Jays on
Choopa in the trunk , Old faithful
Long live me and my niggas
Fuck all the time , let the judge get em
Yeah the money getting long
Long live me and my niggas
Fuck all the time let the judge get em
Long live me and my niggas
Fuck all the time , let the judge get em
Girl the money getting long

Rj:

A life full of Jewelery , Money and magnums
Killing Fashion and dress up like an Assassin
Hating on the shoes , got on Margielas
But I was on the bus like Jerome Bettis
9 to 5 really ain't work for me because I ain't trying to survive I'm trying splurge money
Being on the front line will have your nerves funny
But I survived so you can learn from me
