[Intro]
Is you ready?

[Hook]
If I hold you back then forget me
Cause it’s in me, told you that if you let me
You still get that feeling you got when you met me
I know that you really evolved if you ready, it’s yours
Is you ready, you ready
I’m ready if you ready
If you ready it’s yours

[Verse 1]
Is it fine if your friend taste your jelly
When it’s time, is your friend gon’ be ready
I survived won’t be envy or jelly
Drop you off with your fam in the realest
Okay Freda I might have said this the last time
If I held you back this the last time
I put you first, member last time
Through your worst times and your bad times
Okay now you ain’t gotta leave you ain’t ready to
And yeah I ran the water that I led you to
Only one that made you a better you
I can only play the fool sitting on the pedestal
Now tell the truth

[Hook]
If I hold you back then forget me
Cause it’s in me, told you that if you let me
You still get that feeling you got when you met me
I know that you really evolved if you ready, it’s yours
Is you ready, you ready
I’m ready if you ready
If you ready it’s yours

[Verse 2]
I was ready for the unexpected
Then we fucked up the city it was unprotected
Woke up cashing out on another necklace
Felt broke now I’m ready for another record
Let it go and go, go
Five hundred thousand units sold around the globe
Supplied the right movement in a [?] show
Still somebody’s music so conducive to your soul
Still potatoes on the [?] still sipping ‘94
I said cool it, diamonds drooling
Can’t see me I see through it, I’m translucent
They overrated my influence, distribute it
I came this far going through it
Just to lose it on some fool shit

[Hook]
If I hold you back then forget me
Cause it’s in me, told you that if you let me
You still get that feeling you got when you met me
I know that you really evolved if you ready, it’s yours
Is you ready, you ready
I’m ready, if you ready
If you ready, it’s yours

[Outro]
You ready, you ready, you ready
Are you ready, you ready
You ready, ready, ready, ready
