[Intro: Fabolous]
You see Marsha, I don't know how you could feel a way?
I would never wish you no bad, we went our separate ways
I would wish you the best...PSYCH!!!!

[Verse One: Fabolous]
I hope he's cheating on you with a fat wack silly ho
Hope you see your boyfriend in a Kat Stacks video
Thought I found Cinderella shoe didn't fit her yo
Now I'm gonna have to trend topic you on Twitter though
Nah I ain't bitter, okay I'm kinda bitter yo
Hope that cat shit on you, like you kitty litter though
Oh!!! Daddy tricked you to get your butt up
Uh Huh! OK! Whatever! SHUT UP!!!
Hope you catch him creeping, dating one of your friends
Get y'all both pregnant and y'all babies look like twins
Might say I'm hating, well yes I'm hating
Just thinking 'bout it got me SMH'n

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
(Well look it how it all turned out now!!!)
I hope she cheats on you with a basketball player
(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
I hope you feeling lonely baby now were not together
(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
I hope she cheats on you with a basketball player
(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
Oooh now that I'm without ya

[Verse Two: Marsha Ambrosius]
I hope she cheats on you with an NFL baller
She ignores you every single time you call her
Brand new Louis gotta have it spend your money on her
When you wanna hit it she acting like she don't wanna
I may sound bitter, I'm a little bitter
Just a little bitter, because you were with her
I'm in Salt Lake City now I'm up on a pitcher
Remember how it was when I was with ya
Ba-by!!! Sex so good, do you remember? OH?
Ba-by!!! Sex so good, do you remember? OH?

[Verse Three: Maino]
You don't wanna see me doing good you hoping that I be stressing
Up nights worried and hurt without resting
Wish I get embarrassed and stuck with no blessings
Praying that I feel what you felt without question
I'm trying to touch the sky but you want me down
It's like the video she ended up with Shannon Brown
But that ain't going down cause in real life
I'm the winner middle fingers in the air like
Yeah! You really starting to sound like a hater
My baby girl she would never leave me for a Laker
I'm sorry, I know that I'm the reason for the breakup
At times, I think back and wished that we had made up
Cause I didn't mean to ever make you miserable
But girl, look at life from my point of view
I was young hard not to be a two timer
When girls, is screaming in my ear "Get 'em Tiger!!!"
So now with my new girlfriend
It is what it is this for you girlfriend
And even though you wish me bad I'm a wish you happiness
Look at how it all turned out you'll see what happy is

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]

(Look it how it all turned out now!!!)
Oooh now that I'm without ya

[Bridge: Marsha Ambrosius]
She cute and all but that won't last forever
What I had for you was so much better
Yeah the grass ain't greener on the other side of town
Now look at how it all turns out now

But I'm doing better, cause we ain't together
You sorry excuse for somebody I was into
