[Pre-Hook – Trav][x2]
Imma hold it down, please don’t hold me up
When I look around, all we got is us
If it’s going down you the only one I trust
I believe in god, but I believe in us

[Hook – Trav]
I’m in love with my nina
Never leave home without my nina
I’m in love with my nina
Never leave home without my nina
That’s my real friend
I’m in love with my nina, that’s my real friend [x2]

[Verse 1 – Trav]
Ok, riding round with that nina
I don’t smoke Keisha, I don’t smoke Reggie
But it’s just me and my two seater
Riding around with that thorn
Front and you gon meet her, shit
I don’t know what you thought
Nigga if I point, you get pinned
I got my gun when I go to the mall
Gun when I go to the store
Gun when I go to the club
Gun hanging out my drawers, fuck yeah
Gun in my drawers swanging, Gun every day in Queens
Say what the fuck you mean, you ain’t taking shit from me
Fuck that, pussy nigga beg your pardon, leave a nigga dead in the party
Niggas be talking that tough shit, but these niggas aren’t nobody
All my guns got houses, all my bitches my houses
Niggas be talking that killer shit, nigga I’ll come expose you

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Verse 2 – Maino]
It’s the time to pray, it’s the time to cry
It’s the time to kill, it’s the time to die
Sometimes I’m sober, sometimes I’m high
But never slipping, when it’s time to ride
Fuck friends, I don’t need them homie
Wide out, I got nina on me
Heaters on me, we an army
Hands crossed like Jesus on me
Keep it on me, keep it on me
Cause snake niggas tryna creep it on me
Concealed, can’t see what’s on me
All black but the heater’s clone me
Be afraid when you see the kid, you know how close the heater is
Stuffed all in my polos, it’s like I got two penises
Hold it down, never hold me up
Ride around with the 40 tucked
Hot water, get boiled up
Just me and my nina woah!
