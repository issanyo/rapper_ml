[Hook – PUSH!]
Grind hard, no sleeping
We don't take off no weekends
Interrogated, no speaking
Last of the Mohicans
Living that fast life, we speeding
Making sure the fam eating
Die for what we believe in
Last of the Mohicans
The last of a motherfucking breed that's dying
I said the last of a motherfucking breed that's dying

[Verse 1: Maino]
Now now my past life was a fast life
Had to grind to get the cash right
Any night could be my last night
Out here scuffing up my damn Nikes
My mama broke, my father dead
Where's the hope, you have no idea
Ain't no food in the whole crib
I’ll do anything just for that bread
I'll shoot a nigga in the fucking head
I'll rob a bank, I'll do that bid
I'll sell them drugs, just to live
Man I'm just trying to fill up the fridge
I'm the last of the dying kind
Stand up man, not the crying kind
Cock it back, hold the iron kind
Pop a nigga just for eyein' mines
I'm the last real nigga in the world you heard
They left me in a world full of lames and birds
Looking around now I see lames and birds
They try to tell me I gotta watch my words
Got to watch my words? Well watch for that
Niggas watching my watch got to watch for that
Got the all black Benz, black watch to match
They ride my wave like a stocking cap
Still grinding, take no days off
Still hustling, wait till it pays off
One plan, that's it, no plan b
Can't stop me from feeding my family
Maino, that's right ya’ll know
Last of the Mohicans, Tanto
Fourth fifth and the all black cargos
Real nigga 16 man ya’ll ain’t know?

[Verse 2: PUSH!]
I’m respected like Sonny from Bronx Tale
BK’s version of Barksdale
But I was too bright for that dark cell
I bought a blue Benz of off hard sales
I was 19, stunting in my CL
Cutting that coke with the B12
If money is the root of evil
I'mma burn that paper when I reach hell
Got to make sure the fam never needs for nothing
If you get in the way of that, I’m leaning something
Don’t trust these part-time G’s who will kill
But ain’t willing to bleed for nothing
I pull up like a bartender
With enough heat to live through a harsh winter
Two arms up like Joey Jihad
I’ll send you to Allah quicker
I’m the A-Team’s lost member
But due to my fast paced lifestyle
My side chicks is my wife now
Spending all my time out on these streets
But I still provide when it’s time to eat
Got to live my life like a Rolling Stone
About 2 million in my mobile phone
I had a dream like Martin Luther
But they shot him so I hold the chrome
Trying to be like J and Big Poppa, Mike, JMJ, BIG Pac ya
They fouler than MJ’s doctor
But keep the faith don’t let these niggas stop ya
Get rich or die trying soldier
Chrome fif through the tip, niggas over
I’m like Eighty sitting in that Rover
I’m like Jay and 2, I never fold up
Death before dishonor
