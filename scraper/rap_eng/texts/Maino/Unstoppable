[Hook:]
Where I came from, I ain't supposed to be here
No, but they can't hold me down
I can do it all, now the world is so clear
Ohhh ain't no stopping me now
Got my eyes all on my destiny
Came out the door and now witnessed the best of me
I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left to me
Cause I'm unstoppable
(Yeah!)
I'm unstoppable
(I'll do good mane)
I'm unstoppable
(I'll think of something else)
I'm unstoppable
(After a while baby)
I'm unstoppable
(They can't stop me)
I'm unstoppable

[Verse 1:]
I believe, yes I, I do believe
Anything I put my mind on I promise to achieve
I put, God help me please get me closer to my dreams
I got all the courage that I need to succeed
They said I wasn't good (no!) and that my writting wasn't lyrical (no!)
They said I wouldn't make it said my action was too criminal (what?)
But now they gotta swallow they're words, I'm unmovable
The picture's clearer cause now you're staring at a miracle (yeah!)
But they didn't knew that I would die before I give up
That I'm a fighter, you knock me down, I'm a get up
Giving it my all, 'till I'm gone, no more left
From a freak train I'm coaliting doors to success
Yess!

I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left to me
Cause I'm unstoppable
(Yeah!)
I'm unstoppable
(Aha!)
I'm unstoppable
(So unstoppable)
I'm unstoppable
(The definition)
I'm unstoppable
(This is me)
I'm unstoppable

[Verse 2:]
Strong and confident (confident) lying hard in this (yeah!)
From the depths of hell look at my accomplishments
I got fists too but I just never give it to 'em (no!)
I hear these haters talking I just never listen to 'em (no!)
I'm unstoppable, fuck it, I convinced myself
So invincible, I was made of something else
It's not a bridge I can't cross, not a road I can't walk (no!)
Not a cell that can hold me (no!), I ain't lost (no!)
Never looking down, always keep my head up at the sky
Baby listen to me you can only fail if you don't try
I'm a champion, spirit of a winner, I'm a rise (yeah!)
I can probably do anything I put that in my mind

Where I came from, I ain't supposed to be here

Cause I'm unstoppable
I'm unstoppable
I'm unstoppable
I'm unstoppable
(Yeah!)
I'm unstoppable
(It's talking to me mane)
I'm unstoppable
(This is who I am)

[Verse 3:]
Look at how I feel
Like I'm the man of steel
I'm a call what I would break still
Rolling down the hill
Unstopable
Still going, failure's never optional
Never back down baby (no!) anything it's possible
Never given up, never fold, never break
Never bow down, still shine on my darkest day
I believe in myself even if you don't agree
I'm living proof that anything can happen if you dream

I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left to me
Cause I'm unstoppable
I'm unstoppable
I'm unstoppable
I'm unstoppable
I'm unstoppable
I'm unstoppable
