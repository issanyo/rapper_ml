[Intro: Maino]
Uh, yeah
Live for me
Live for me
For my kids lil nigga
Woo, Yeah
I need you to live for me, woo

[Verse 1: Maino]
Yeah, you don't understand right now
I lost my Pops same age that you are right now
I learned a lesson, keep going when the odds are down
And when it's dark, you can see the stars shine down
I wanna protect you, you don't know the pain I felt
I was trapped, spent years in a cage, no help
Tryna keep you out the devil's hands
Don't want you livin' like me, you be a better man
And the plan is for me to help you get ahead
Strong minded black male, that's how you advance
And I know in your mind, I be hard at times
You gotta know, in the streets ain't where your hearts defined
It's the spirit you possess that'll help you grow
I'm sorry that me and your mom's can't be that close
Just to see you live, I'd give up my soul
Gotta stay strong in the event that I go
Need you to live for me

[Chorus: FNL & That Girl Georgie]
Was fine till I think about it, but now it's intact
Sorry I had to live like that
Was there I had to give right back
I'm gonna make a way, someday
And I got yo back
How to make it? I'll teach you that
You need me and I need you back
Just keep me in your heart always

[Verse 2: Maino]
Took time to realize
Wasn't ready, busy womanizing
Another child wasn't part of my plan, see
And I hate myself for wishing she'd swallowed that plan B, yuh
I've done it, it looks just like me
I pray she doesn't fall for a man that's like me, no
Tryna turn into a better father
But my demons is pullin' it's gettin' harder
So I wrote this letter for you in case I wasn't with you
Times that you were cryin', wasn't there to hold the tissue
Just know I love you, don't be scared to dream
Remember that a man only respects a queen
And I'm sorry me and mom's can't be that close
But it's still my job to keep you off the post
Just to see you live, I'd give up my soul
Stay strong in the event that I go
I need you to live for me

[Chorus: FNL & That Girl Georgie]
Was fine till I think about it, but now it's intact
Sorry I had to live like that
Was there I had to give right back
I'm gonna make a way, someday
And I got yo back
How to make it? I'll teach you that
You need me and I need you back
Just keep me in your heart always

[Verse 3: Maino]
Sins of thy father
Pray my kids don't fall victim to my Karma
Up nights just tryna feed her my gold heart, uh
Black flowers what'd they minds, they grow sharper (preach)
They will never live like I used to
Or feel the pain and the hunger I was used to
Cold nights hot days that was usual
Just to see a dead body that's not unusual
Yeah, keep my son away from street corners
Keep my daughter safe, don't let them creeps sweet talk her
I got many flaws, living with regrets
A ghetto king tryna raise my prince and princess

[Chorus: FNL & That Girl Georgie]
Was fine till I think about it, but now it's intact
Sorry I had to live like that
Was there I had  to give right back
I'm gonna make a way, someday
And I got yo back
How to make it? I'll teach you that
You need me and I need you back
Just keep me in your heart always
