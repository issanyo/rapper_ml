[Intro: DJ Drama]
I like that
We gone
On the wall
Maino
Drama
Classy

[Hook]
This life I live
Just to feed my kids
And you can touch me
I don't came for nothing
I still survive
I went so high
I felt like I never
Been so close
Ever, nver
I've never been been so close
Ever, never

[Verse 1: Maino]
Look into my eyes, you could see the truth
You could see the grind, you could see the booth
You could see the shine, you could see the coupe
You could me, but you don't see the roof
Cause I ride hard, I could see the stars
No top now, I'm close to the God
Hold my son and hope for tomorrow
This for the ones that won't see tomorrow
Count my blessings, yes n' could a been stressing
Made it out the ghetto, Lord no questions
Stylin', growling, throwing in up thousands
Made it out of the project housing
Now look at me, I really can't believe
It all came true, I'l living out a dream
Clone my self, I'm never going to fail
It's gotta be Heaven, I've already been to Hell

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Maino]
I could a been lost, could a been a loser
Could a been dead, shot by the ruger
Could a been dumb, drug abuser
Could a been stressed, groom be a tomb a
But I found life, God damn right
Could a been left in a cell no light
Look at my life, somethings with me
Gotta be blessed, cause Angels with me
Let's get it popping, rocking, still club hopping
Straight to the top, failure not an option
Hate me, love me, still can't budge me
None of y'all ever gon' judge me
Never been close, still it like this
Never seen a sky from a view like this
Gotta feel good when you living like this
Lord this is Heaven, who wouldn't want this

[Hook]
