[Verse 1: Maino]
Uh, I got rich off of killer talk
Free my homies, let my killers walk
Sixty grand on my weaker arm
Chill on Gates Ave with my Adidas on
Guess you gotta love a nigga for surviving
Visions of my mama in her bedroom crying
Man that's not your brother if you get divided
How you sleep at night after testifying
I'm just getting money I'm not chasing fame
Tattoos on my body just to hide the vein
Hard to find a spot where I can place the blame
Strippers staring at me wanting me to make it rain
Dollar bills throwing all my dollar bills
Niggas riding for me maybe this how power feels
Caught up in the moment trying to reach forever
The niggas in the streets say I'm the realest ever

[Hook: 911 Kev]
I'm great, I'm a G, ask God
It's so hard knowing niggas hustle hard
Dollar bills, dollar dollar dollar bills
When you're playing with these corners
That's exactly how you feel

[Verse 2]
Product of them corners in that crack era
Yeah, my superheroes they was five percenters
Born original my idols they was criminals
Shout out to Dog, showed me my first pistol too
Started with a dream and some ready ripe
On the strip yelling nigga I get better types
Now I'm staring at the top of my cathedral ceiling
So many homies dead and gone I can't even feel it
Maybe I should put it all in God's hands
How do babies end up dead? Guess it's God's plan
Club closing but I'm chilling, I'ma sit here drunk
Shorty pulling on me, naw I'm just feeling numb
Yeah, 300 Ms in my vision lately
Yeah, early 90s I'm a kitchen baby
All I ever wanted was a chance to make it
So I can't help but act a fool and celebrate it

[Hook]
