[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't be scared
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared

[Verse 1: Maino]
They tell you that I'm no good for you
Too rude, too cool, too hood for ya
Ya friends sayin' things that they shouldn't tell you
They like, "Nah girl, he a bad look for you"
They try to paint me to be a monster
And all that just makes you put your guards up
I'm like, "Nah, don't trust what your friends say
'Cause they miserable, they hatin', it's clear as day"
All that talk in the beauty shop is hear say
You can't believe 'em when they tell you that I'm crazy
Yes, I can't lie that I'm a hood nigga
But deep down I'm a good nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared

[Verse 2: Maino]
Listen yeah, look what you showed me, how could you fault me?
You let em judge me and they don't even know me
What makes me so bad? Because my pants sag?
I shouldn't have to make no excuse for who I am
Yeah, I'm a thug right? You what a thug likes
I can't help that I want you in a thug's life
I mean the whole world is what I'm tryna bring to ya
Make ya own choice, don't let 'em think for you
You prolly think what your friends say can't be wrong
"What kinda man always keeps a bandana on?
So now you back to ignorin' me
You back lyin' to yourself about wantin' me

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared

[Verse 3: Maino]
Uh, I can't stop all the things that they say about me (I can't)
But what's sad is you believe what you hear about me (damn)
You can't see all these haters wanna see you doubt me
But deep down, girl, I know you see yourself around me
I'm so real, man, my life is a movie flick
You can't see it 'cause you caught up on that bougie shit
Now tell me you don't want me
Look me in my face, say you never gon' call me
Tell me you don't wanna open up and give me all that
Feel on my tattoos, touch where I'm scarred at
I guess I'm tryin' just a bit much
You care what other people think, so I'ma give it up

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared
They might even say you should leave me alone
They might even say you should leave me alone
