[Intro: Dios Moreno]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh no, no
Oh no, no
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family

[Chorus: Maino, Dios Moreno, Both]
I do this for all of my niggas
All of my niggas is family Lets go
I go so hard for my niggas
All of my niggas is family
Niggas you see me around
I call them niggas my family Let's go
I go so hard for my niggas
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family
Niggas you see me around
I call them niggas my family
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family

[Verse 1: Maino & Dios Moreno]
I go to war with my niggas
I go to war with my niggas
Started off poor with my niggas
Now I just ball with my niggas
It's so easy goin' my niggas
Never say no to my niggas, nah nah
No sneakers talkin' about it
I'd rather show you my niggas
Look how we made it, we come from the bottom
Missin' my homies, some crackers still got em
I want revenge on the niggas that shot em
Pray to the heavens, God hope that you got em
Only family, I don't fuck with niggas
Only depend on a couple niggas
Niggas take form and they won't budge
Don't need the same blood to be brotha nigga

[Chorus: Maino, Dios Moreno, Both]
I do this for all of my niggas
All of my niggas is family Lets go
I go so hard for my niggas
All of my niggas is family
Niggas you see me around
I call them niggas my family Let's go
I go so hard for my niggas
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family
Niggas you see me around
I call them niggas my family
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family

[Verse 2: Maino, Dios Moreno]
Niggas you see me around
They the ones holding's it down
Yeah I keep killers around
That's just my family now
Love all my niggas they know it
Love all my niggas they know it
Never too proud to show it
Pop like a bottle of Moet
We're fuckin' a bucket of fools
We was just cuttin' the schools
We ain't have nothing, so we ain't have nothin' to lose
What I want, I want for you too
Put down this pad and this pencil
Quickly you grabbing your pistol
I don't think you understand me
All of these niggas my family

[Chorus: Maino, Dios Moreno, Both]
I do this for all of my niggas
All of my niggas is family Lets go
I go so hard for my niggas
All of my niggas is family
Niggas you see me around
I call them niggas my family Let's go
I go so hard for my niggas
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family
Niggas you see me around
I call them niggas my family
All of my niggas is family
All of my niggas is family
