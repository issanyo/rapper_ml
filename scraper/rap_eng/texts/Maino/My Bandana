[Hook:]
My bandana
Your my star
Your my moon
My guitar
We don't know
Where we are
Still we stand

[Verse 1: Maino]
They say people like me
End up dead or in the jail cell
No food had to eat off of crack sales
Before u try to judge me off of my life style
Put your self in the shoes of a black male
What's my chances of gettin' out of poverty
It's my god given right to pull a robbery
Society labels me a misfitter
But in the street I'm looked at as a real nigga'
My bandana in my right hand
I fold it up and tie it around my whole hood
They don't understand why I keep a rag
Why it's hanging on the back of my pants
I keep one maybe two or three
Represents where I come from it's a g thing
Salute all the young boys and the OG's
Every thug in the country knows me

[Hook:]
My bandana
Your my star
Your my moon
My guitar
We don't know
Where we are
Still we stand

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I keep a rag cause u never know
Bandana my face why let it show, in case you gotta' let it go
Anyway, I'm more than good from queens to foreign hood
Hoodstar touch the block like the man in office could
My bandana pass down for my son, sons and brother
Gone before he turn 21
Guns salute biggie out the coupe
While I shoot up and down the block thinking how to get the loot
The jake don't see a celebrity, they see a set up
Plotting to knock u down before u get up
You talk and live it. Just left my homie came off the visit
Revisiting good times back before he did it
Keep the weed going and pop another bottle
They thought we never make it here victim of the hollow
Out here everybody got a hammer I never change for the camera that's on...

[Hook:]
My bandana
Your my star
Your my moon
My guitar
We don't know
Where we are
Still we stand
