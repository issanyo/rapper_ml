[Verse 1: Maino]
Bedstuy Brooklyn homie, yeah thats where I`m from

He was strapped, I came back, hit his block with the uzi
Met a bitch that come from Texas, she took me where she strip
Asked me pay for lip injections, she want Kylie Jenner lips
I said bitch I ain't your nigga, I`m a killer, I know dealers
I`m the realest, bet she couldn't find another nigga triller
Hopping out the Lamborghini, in black on black [???]
Bitches watching, Im so popping, hoes peep me when they see me
She said Maino take that crown off Cause you know you ain't no Biggie
Shut up bitch you just mad, your baby father couldn't be me

[Hook: Maino]
We got shooters everywhere, shooters everywhere, shooters everywhere
They pull up, they pop out, they will shoot you anywhere
We got shooters everywhere, shooters everywhere, shooters everywhere
They pull up, they pop out, they will shoot you anywhere

[Verse 2: Uncle Murda]
She just gave me becky though, now she trying to hit my [???]
She trying to spend the night with me but it`s that time of the month (It`s time to go!)
I ain't with it, shorty tripping, I can't hit it
Get my phone, check the gram, see what`s popping
Get an Uber send her home, matter fact, fuck an Uber put her in a yellow cab
This bitch pretty, but she broke, she live with her mom and dad(DAMN!)
Thotting everywhere, these bitches thotting everywhere
I got pieces, dems is hitting, I be shopping everywhere
I got beef, if I see you, get it popping anywhere
Broad day in Manhattan, let the chopper go right there (Bang Bang)
Then I call and Uber like "Yo get me out of here"
Me and my shooters had a shootout in the middle of Times Square (GOD DAMN!)
Bodies everywhere, I think there is bodies everywhere
I think some white people got hit, I dont know, I dont fucking care

[Hook: Maino]
We got shooters everywhere, shooters everywhere, shooters everywhere
They pull up, they pop out, they will shoot you anywhere
We got shooters everywhere, shooters everywhere, shooters everywhere
They pull up, they pop out, they will shoot you anywhere
