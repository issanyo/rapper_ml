[Intro: Maino (DJ Drama)]
(B-X, we got one!)
Yea-yeah (South Brooklyn)
Yea-yeah, unstoppable
I'm on now, nigga!
Fred The Godson, Maino

[Verse 1: Maino]
Standin' on the terrace in my bathrobe
Lookin' at the sky and the stars close
Feelin' like a king in my con pose
Model bitch is sniffin' coke off the console
This the life that I prayed for
Toss to the ones, I said I wouldn't take off
Now look, I done prove niggas way wrong
On the grind, long nights, they done paid off
So ask me if I'm a rapper (haha)
Nah nigga, I'm an actor
Fooled 'em, just to get my shoes in
Got in the door, then I snuck goons in
So fuck 'em all, so have 'em all now
One button in the Benz knock the ceiling down
Unstoppable, whole world hear me now
Yeah, you can't tell me I ain't the realest now

[Chorus: Fred The Godson]
(How you don't know me?)
All the magazine covers
Shawty you don't talk to your brother
(How you don't know me?)
With your cable and all, but you don't like rap
Maybe I'm wrong, you tell me
(How you don't know me?)
I'm on YouTube, Worldstar
My mixtape in your girl car
(How you don't know me?)
I'm all over the FM
Whoever don't know, F 'em

[Verse 2: Fred The Godson]
Slick talker, you know me
Kemba Walker, the only way you con me
I'm in a Yukon, seen in a DuPont, shit
Tryin' to save money like a coupon, me
I blow it all, that's what the cake for
I'm speakin' on girls in Yukon, I'll make more
Way more, my bags weigh more
I'm tryin' to throw a couch in the Maybach, Raymour
In Flanagan, there go ya man again
When I spit, damage him, leave him stiff, mannequin
First class then we lift off, but we land again
Probably somewhere in Chicago, I plan to win
I'm not with the shenanigans
They call me Fred the Shammgod, I can handle him
Ran through like Randall in Philadelph
If you still don't know me, kill yourself

[Chorus: Fred The Godson]
(How you don't know me?)
All the magazine covers
Shawty you don't talk to your brother
(How you don't know me?)
With your cable and all, but you don't like rap
Maybe I'm wrong, you tell me
(How you don't know me?)
I'm on YouTube, Worldstar
My mixtape in your girl car
(How you don't know me?)
I'm all over the FM
Whoever don't know, F 'em
