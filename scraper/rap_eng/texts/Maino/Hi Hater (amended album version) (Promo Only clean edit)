New year tryna touch me a mill ya'll
Came up now. I'm what's Up now
When U shine all these haters wanna talk down
I don't feel a way about what a nigga say
It's alright luv I let a hater hate
Pull up on them see them paper plate
See da oyster perpetuate day 2 day
It's a fact right. Niggas act trife
How they smile in your face then they back bite
I just laugh right. Make em' mad like
Watch them turn around and say he ain't that nice
Getting bread dough. Mad head hoe
Seems like they don't love you till you dead yo
Let em' talk dog it don't phase me
It might not be right if they don't hate me

(Chorus:)
