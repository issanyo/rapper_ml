Now if you recognize real we'll recognize you
Now what you gonn do when the storm come through
(when the day come baby, you better be ready,)
Or you might just get blown away..
Cos this is it yeah
It's survival of the fittest
So you better be and mind your business
'Cause baby nothin' else matters
You gotta be you and keep doin' what you do so
Hustle hard, hustle hard, hustle hard yeah yeah [3x]
Hustle hard
[Maino:]
MAINO (yeah)
This is what it is (is), I get it how I live, (live)
Imma grind hard the only way for me to live (live)
Got hustle in my veins (veins), I feel it in my bones (bones)
I came in this game with crack money in my clothes (oh)
Look at how I roll so on truth no actor (no), just a real nigga, never said I was a rapper (no)
Critics see the d*** the single still went platinum
If you don't say that's hustlin' then whatchu call that then
Call it whatchu want, but tell me whatchu seein
My money getting stronger, my cars is European
The woman that you love the same women that I peein
The places that you run from the places that I been
Imma get a dollar one way or another
Got the mast up, with a black flag with a rubber, forever
Imma hustle hard till they bury me, whatever, only to the top is where they carry me

[Maino:]
Yeahh
Shooters on deck, so nigga don't test me
Mach 10 on the back seat of that Bentley
Duggin' till I die, the ghetto still in me
I'm the same dude that I was when you met me
Money on my brain, now look what I became
I just been tryna get it, don't tell me that I changed
I came up doing chooksizz, just a young crook then
Now I'm in the limelight, I'd do it all for Brooklyn
This is for my comrades, tryna get a mill
Get dope money, or that weed money or them pills
I'd show them how it feels, to do it from the ground up
Back to back Benz's, rio tint that town up
Look at me I'm ridin', diamonds, hustlin'
Yeah I'm still grindin', strivin', struggling
Never will I ever go back to that penitentiary
Lights camera action, my life is a documentary..

[Maino:]
Don't stop
If you recognize real we'll recognize you
I run with gorillas, I was raised in the zoo
I come from the block, crack rock in my shoe
I hustle nonstop, I played it by the rules
Survival of the fittest, if you with it then let's get it
In the air, its close I can feel it
Comin' for the riches, I'm startin' get near it
Everything is phak, can you doubt that I'm the realest?
