[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, baby
I wanna get crazy
I wanna get crazy
Let's just get crazy

Ooh, baby, baby
I wanna get crazy
I wanna get crazy
Let's just get crazy

[Rap: Maino]
All we wanna do is get a little crazy
Party all night then we sleep all day
All top gone in a white Bentley
Better bow down when you see my, baby

We just wanna roll it, light it, smoke it
Hands up in the sky, wave
Like it, buy it, getting paid
Clubbing, girls, liqueur, cray

I'm living my dreams of love
I'm buying big things, I'm home
We 'bout to take off, we're gone
I'm addicted to the life, I'm wrong

I'm pleading the fifth, your honor
None of these dudes smoke hotter
Skies torch with a torch, that's fire
She cool, but Erika's flier

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, baby
I wanna get crazy
I wanna get crazy
Let's just get crazy

Ooh, baby, baby
I wanna get crazy
I wanna get crazy
Let's just get crazy

[Verse 1]
You're just too hot
I'm stuck like, "Oh, my god"
Your face is a work of art
I'm stuck like a car won't start, baby

If we live once
I don't wanna mess this fun
You're just my type
And tonight is the night, baby

I like your crooked smile
I like your suit and tie
I'm such a good girl
And I should play nice

But I'm feeling naughtier
I really wanna dance
I wanna take the chance
Baby, baby

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, baby
I wanna get crazy
I wanna get crazy
Let's just get crazy

Ooh, baby, baby
I wanna get crazy
I wanna get crazy
Let's just get crazy

[Bridge]
And you so hot

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, baby
I wanna get crazy
I wanna get crazy
Let's just get crazy

Ooh, baby, baby
I wanna get crazy
I wanna get crazy
Let's just get crazy

Ooh, baby, baby
I wanna get crazy
I wanna get crazy
Let's just get crazy

Ooh, baby, baby
I wanna get crazy
I wanna get crazy
Let's just get crazy
