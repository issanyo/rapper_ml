[Intro: Maino] (x2)
Yeah, I was born me, So I'mma be me
Tryna be another man I really can't be
So I'mma do me, Yeah I'mma do me
And this ain't nothing made up, this is just me

[Verse 1: Maino]
So what I ain't smooth like that
Or cool like that
I'm not Soulja Boy, don't really want swag
I'm my own man, I am what I am
The realest nigga here, that's exactly who I am
I don't rap like Hov, or act like Hov
Guess what baby girl, I can't be Hov
I can only be the person that my Mother made
This is what it is, I ain't tryna be another way
I'mma say it loud, I'm proud to be my own self
When you see me now, I'm tryna build my own wealth
I done put it down, practically with no help
Going for that crown, do it for my own self

[Hook: Maino] (x2)
Cause I am who I am, I am what I am
You ain't got to love me but I am who I am
The game don't know what the streets understand
I'm not afraid to be just exactly who I am

[Verse 2: Maino]
Cause I am who I am, this is what you getting from me
I'mma stand out, cause all these niggas different from me
I'mma keep it real, what was you expecting from me
I don't do what Jay do, never get it twisted homie
I'mma hustle hard, do it all day
Try to tell 'em though, I can't be Kanye
I'mma soldier on deck if you want me
Got the truth in depth if you call me
I'm a visionary, fuck the penitentiary
Came up from a hood that's legendary
What you see is what you get, no imaginary
The first coming up from my self, never second guess me

[Hook] (x2)

[Bridge: Maino]
Breakdown
I'm not like him
And when you here me
I don't sound like them

[Verse 3: Maino]
I ain't begging for acceptance, either you accept it
You ain't gotta love me, but you niggas going to respect it
Look into my soul, see a spirit of a true man
This if for my fans who love me just for who I am
This is who I am, the way God designed me
I does what I do, ain't as lyrical as Kweli
I don't study other niggas then and try to copy
I just stick to being me, it's true they can't stop me

[Hook] (x2)
