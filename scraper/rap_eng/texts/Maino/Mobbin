[Verse 1:Maino]
Mafia, mafia, be apart of my mafia
Make way 'cuz we coming through
Mobbed up, we the mafia
See the way that we mobbin'
Ain't playin with it we ballin'
Don't wait no line
I'll stay outside
Until everyone of my dogs in
My dick big and my money long
In the club about a hundred strong
Bottles poppin', bitches watchin'
Staring at us like a movie on
Blue jeans and them black flags
White bitch, super bad
Black girl, Birkin bag, tattoos, stupid ass
Stupid ass, stupid ass
These lame niggas is super ass
Hundred bottles, fuck the world
Let it fly is what we do with cash
Bad bitches they notice me with my ros√© and my rosary
Love a bitch that love a bitch
So you and your friend y'all can roll with me

[Chorus:Maino]
Mobbin, mobbin a hundred deep we mobbin
Make way 'cuz we're coming through
In the club we mobbin x2
Mafia, mafia, be apart of my mafia
Make way 'cuz we coming through
Mobbed up, we the mafia x2

Hundred bottles in the club I'm on that movie shit (squad)

[Verse 3:Maino]
40 niggas with all black on
Who only party after their crack gone
Going hard in the spot with two thousand girls with they cracks showin'
Come inside of my world loc
Chicks visit me like furloughs
I wake up in wide hotels with bad bitches I don't know
I live it man, I did it man
This big boy bitch can't fit her pants
Spanish girl who swallowing that's how she make her dinner plans
Steady mobbin, plenty nights
30 cars, hazard lights
My watch on, hazard lights
Sparkles glowing, candle light
Mobbin, mobbin, so high I looked retarded
Ain't gotta hate you can have that bitch
'Cuz I'mma fuck regardless
Got goons all in my section
Models all in my section
Standing up, screaming Brooklyn
Watch me nigga I'm flexin'(flex)

[Chorus:Maino]
Mobbin, mobbin a hundred deep we mobbin
Make way 'cuz we're coming through
In the club we mobbin x2
Mafia, mafia, be apart of my mafia
Make way 'cuz we coming through
Mobbed up, we the mafia x2
