Hey hey oh hey

Hey Swizz
I guess I woke up on the right side of the bed
That’s how I feel

(hook)

I think I might give away a million bucks
I think might give away a brand new truck
Cause I feel good
Yea I feel good
Cause I feel good
I think I might take alot of shopping sprees
U in the club goddam all drinks on me
Cause I feel good
Yea I feel good
Cause I feel good
Hey

Good Lord look what a beautiful day
My enimes gone ain’t here they gone away
I feel good
Everything is ok
I feel like givin all my money away
Cause niggas is broke ain’t no bread in the hood
Look what they did they sellin Feds in the hood
I ain’t going to change I’m coming back through the hood
Do what I do and then back to the hood
I’m blessed I went places I never been
I lived to see a black president
I’m good, yes I feel good
Drinks on me baby what’s good

(hook)

For the ones who got more than 1 mouth to feed
Gas so high, got em’ riding on E
Daddy needs shoes and kids gotta eat
They can have every last Penney on me
Me and swizzy rollin in the lambo
Sit back reminiscing this and when I never had no
Dollas, pride is well poor dear mama
Stuck to the fight like a drained out boxer
So I know what it feels like to not have much
I should give away what I made last month
I gotta alot to feel good about
I think I’m gonna give away a good amount

(hook)

One shot for my niggas in the state pen
Two shots for my niggas still hustling
I feel good
I’m so good
Man I rose from the bottom and it feels good

Man I’m a introduce to you a new dance
It’s called the money dance
You pull the money out your pocket like this
You put your hands in the air like this
And you simply just umm
Bounce throw it all around
(Throw) throw it all around x3
A little more now
Throw it all around
A little more now
Throw it all around

(hook)
