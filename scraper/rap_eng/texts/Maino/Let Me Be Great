[Chorus: Lyrivelli]
My enemies put money on my head
Drunk off of Hennessy, won't forget, won't forgive
Will they remember me forever when I'm dead
This is my legacy, my legacy, my legacy, oh
Let me be great, let me be, let me be great
Let me be great, let me be, let me be great
Let me be great, let me be, let me be great
Let me be great, let me be (yeah), let me be great (ah)

[Verse 1: Maino]
I almost gave up on this rap shit
Surrounded by some killers that I trap with
Plottin' murder over tables full of Chinese food
Ridin' dirty with some wolves and a hungry mood
Many nights prayin' for our life beautiful
So if I die, I need strippers at my funeral
I need love but the hate seems to make me stronger
Need a bitch that piss me off but still make me call her
Done it all, think I done it all
Took shots at my enemies, turned around and balled
Started out with home, made a profit off of coke
Fucked a couple famous hoes, flew Blac Chyna coach

[Chorus: Lyrivelli]
My enemies put money on my head
Drunk off of Hennessy, won't forget, won't forgive
Will they remember me forever when I'm dead
This is my legacy, my legacy, my legacy, oh
Let me be great, let me be, let me be great
Let me be great, let me be, let me be great
Let me be great, let me be, let me be great
Let me be great, let me be, let me be great

[Verse 2: Maino]
Yeah, uh, bury me with money and a pint of liquor
Case they trippin' off in heaven, I'm in hell sippin'
Bought Bentleys off of rapping 'bout drugs and balance
Couldn't find a wife, ended up with hoes with mileage
They won't let a nigga be the greatest
Last thing I ever wanted was to be was famous
Rappers tell lies, I despise fakeness
Fell asleep drunk, dreamt I was Pappy Mason
I'm the realest and they know it though
Still got these niggas shakin' like the holy ghost
Shots fired, niggas run for cover
Got a message for the feds, please free my brother

[Chorus: Lyrivelli]
My enemies put money on my head
Drunk off of Hennessy, won't forget, won't forgive
Will they remember me forever when I'm dead
This is my legacy, my legacy, my legacy, oh
Let me be great, let me be, let me be great
Let me be great, let me be, let me be great
Let me be great, let me be, let me be great
Let me be great, let me be, let me be great
