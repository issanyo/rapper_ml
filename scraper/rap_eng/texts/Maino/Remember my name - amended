I promise to be
Nuttin short of a G
Never beg for mercy, never seein me flee
Got blood on my knife, Got cash in my jeans
Did dirt in my life, havin nightmares in my dreams
I remember my father, I was watchin him suffer
Help me heavenly father, don't let my life get rougher
And you gotta forgive me, I got alcohol in me
Even after Im dead, niggas will never forgive me
I got homies I love that I lost in the game
In my mind they sayin "make em remember your name"
If they love you its cool, give em a reason to hate you
I ain't chasin the fame
Said You gunna remember my name

If I'm alive or not

Imagine a casket
Imagine me in it
Now take your time
And try to picture this kind of vision
My funeral, my homies dead, my momma cryin
My son is hurt, his daddy gone, now say goodbye
I'm just a memory, baby do you remember me?
Gave yall all a good reason just to remember see
Now I'm reaching heavenly, I'ma leave a legacy
My Niggas gunna swear on my name and pour out Hennessey
They gon say I did it all, started out with mixin' crack
Look at that before he went to jail he didn't even rap
Came home in the street back up at the block again
Out of nowhere street nigga killed the rap game

If I'm alive or not

Block & guard the spot
Said you gonna remember my name
From the start 'til the end
Whether I lose or win
Family for a friend
Said you gunna remember my name
My name, my naaaaammee yeah
Said you gunna remember my name
My name

Left a mark in the hood, Made a mark in the world
Went straight from the hood, to the top of the world
You can tell that I'm different; you can see that I lived it
When I'm gone you gunna remember me clearly and vivid
The face of an angel, the heart of a lion
Champion spirit, blessed with the will of surviving
You remember the face, you remember the game
When its said and done:
Said you gon remember my name

If I'm alive or not
Cold or Hot
Block & guard the spot
From the start 'til the end
Whether lose or win
Family for a friend
