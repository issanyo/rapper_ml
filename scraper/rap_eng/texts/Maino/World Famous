They can’t f*ck with us
Brooklyn
Unstoppable
Come on, man!

The fourth fifth with the hoster
Louie Lofa’s champagne in the glass
Crashed in the rover
For six days I ain’t for sober can’t slow up
Woke up bout of my mind I’m hung over
Top for the globe just me and my dogs
The sign on the... of the world os...
Reminiscent on friends I caught fellonies with
In the truck get licked by celebrity bitch
From the block to the whips that’s a half a mile
This is Brooklyn rest in peace, half a mile
This the world famous, we rise and still banging
Screaming out real my niggas can’t...
Nine bottles turn kiss in the white models
D hang all over my neck, I can’t hide though
Mafia this year nigags gonna learn
We connected moving like we was the firm, yeah

World, world famous
World famous, famous

Jesus piece with the gold link
Black bens door’s up, good gold wing
Will your girl been, wonder where she coming from
Rapped around my three piece like we come...
Ladies know the name never confused me
I’m Gucci that’s... 2 G pop roses
Slide with a gold little...
Intentions on slipping my pockets and rule think
Now normally I got class like a five hour
Be round on the tops, Steve hots hour
And tryin to push begonies signed the benny hind in
When I play the roll for the mob like could you find her
Play the haters you don’t speak on

Look, pop off, I’m all cynic, you a nack off
This is vintage, OG sixes
Had to learn to stay away from all this slow licked is popped them
Now you swear like that gold tiff nigga you steal living
Can you owe me nigga, this is now
You’re screaming out you owe me nigga
It’s obvious you don’t know me nigga
It’s lucky dawn I stand front awaiting my damn turn
You’re hating this man burn
Through it up, light up
He ain’t real, he a damn liar
Talked to mouth like a in fire
Living that life, vampire
The mafia is the empire
We all... mind is the whire
Got a bad red bitch that remind me a whire
Dj take it back like time a tire
You’re tryin to get rich and front shit mind is the prior
