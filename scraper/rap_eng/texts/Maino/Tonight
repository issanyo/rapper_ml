[Intro]
Yeah you already know what it is, you know what we about. We gon' keep on winnin', we gon' keep on shinin', we gon' keep on risin'. Unstoppable on these niggas. You understand!?

[Hook]
You must ain't used to us winnin'
Seein' my team poppin' and shinin'
But I don't fuck with you tonight
But I don't fuck with you
You prolly one of them niggas who've hatin' on me
You prolly one of them bitches who've been blinded
Been weighing on my downfall
Don't wanna see me with the crown, dawg
Go figure
You're prolly one of them niggas who've been stressin'
Cause I'm in VIP and you ain't on the guest list
I said I would invite you niggas to my section
But I don't fuck with you tonight

[Verse 1]
When they see you break, weak niggas'll hate
Spectacular, ask niggas why they're mad at yah
Diamonds glistenin', niggas whisperin'
Yeah it's them again, order more rounds for my women friends
Clear the room, when I'm comin' through
You already know we don't fuck with you
So I'ma make a toast to these niggas
Come on, snap a picture, let me pose for these niggas
I'ma ball harder 'cause I know that they there watchin'
Know that they've been plottin' but failure's not an option
Spendin' thousands, drive drunk with a crown on
One room, two models, I'ma pound 'em
You niggas just food to stick the hounds on
But I'd rather let you see me get my style on
Still grinnin', all these bitches I've been in
Let's get it, 30 bottles, we winnin'

[Hook]
You must ain't used to us winnin'
Seein' my team poppin' and shinin'
But I don't fuck with you tonight
But I don't fuck with you
You prolly one of them niggas who've hatin' on me
You prolly one of them bitches who've been blinded
Been weighing on my downfall
Don't wanna see me with the crown, dawg
Go figure
You're prolly one of them niggas who've been stressin'
Cause I'm in VIP and you ain't on the guest list
I said I would invite you niggas to my section
But I don't fuck with you tonight

[Verse 2]
"How you living Maino?"
I'm on that fuck fame shit
No tints, half 'sleep in that Range, bitch
Brought my new girl and she brought out her main chick
Big shoes like I'm Big Daddy Kane, bitch
Margielas on, the camera's on
Pretty ho, body like a Amazon
Too drunk, I can barely keep my balance on
G shit but my fade look like Farrakhan's
Hatin' ass niggas still prayin' on my downfall
Fuck 'em all, that's just gon' make me wear the crown more
More, I don't fuck with you tonight
Nah, I don't fuck with you for life
All that slick talk'll get your girl fucked out of spite
Pull up on your block in a Wraith, I just might
Shorty said, "You be doin' the most", prolly right
I shits on 'em, get 'em so mad they wanna fight

[Hook]
You must ain't used to us winnin'
Seein' my team poppin' and shinin'
But I don't fuck with you tonight
But I don't fuck with you
You prolly one of them niggas who've hatin' on me
You prolly one of them bitches who've been blinded
Been weighing on my downfall
Don't wanna see me with the crown, dawg
Go figure
You're prolly one of them niggas who've been stressin'
Cause I'm in VIP and you ain't on the guest list
I said I would invite you niggas to my section
But I don't fuck with you tonight
