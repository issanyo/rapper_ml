[Intro:]
Yea
Yea yea yea
I can only be me my nigga
I'm not onyx nigga
Yea c'mon man

[Chorus:]
I ain't Big homie
I ain't Jay-Z
I can't do it like snoop
Baby that ain't me
I can be me
I'm a be me
I can't copy no man
I'm a be me
Look how diddy dance
I can't do that
And I don't wear my clothes
Like Jim Jones
You know that
I can only be me
I'm a be me
I can't be what I'm not
I'm a be me

[Verse 1:]
I don't immitate
I initiate
And I dson't sound like no body
Let's set it straight
I don't rap like Jadakiss
I'm different
And I ain't just talkin our records
I'm really livin it
I ain't Wayne
I ain't Game
Ain't none of em
I'm a be myself
I'm trying to be like none of em
Look how we done it crack
We gone do the same rap
Homie I ain't Fab
Nigga shoot me I shot him back
So forgive me
If I ain't your favorite rapper
I'm just a thug on a song
I don't play with rappers
The second of none it's the first to me
And to put it more blunt
I'm a be me

[Chorus:]
I ain't Nas, baby
I ain't Mob Deep
I know you lookin for Jeezy
But that ain't me
I can be me
I'm a be me
I can't copy no man
I'm a be me
Kanye Make beats
I can't do that
You can't expect me to be 50
And you know that
I can only be me
I'm a be me
I can't be what I'm not
I'm a be me

[Verse 2:]
This is me respect me for who I am
Don't expect me to immolate another man
I'm not the next Pac
I ain't the next big
I'm just me my nigga
I get it how I live
You hear that pain in me
Ain't nothing fake with me
I can't be what I'm not
Dog that ain't in me
I'm the truth
It's hard for me to live a lie
I can't sound like I'm from the south
I'm from the star
Real niggas they love me for doing what I do
The streets know I don't make songs like Common do
I don't jump around like in Busta video
But I lay a nigga down like a busta video

[Chorus:]
My nigga B.G
My nigga T.I.P
I know they love outkast
But that ain't me
I could be me
I'm a be me
I can't copy no man
I'm a be me
Look how Akon sing
I can't do that
And I don't make songs like Tylin
You know that
I can only be me
I'm a be me
I can't be what I'm not
I'm a be me

[Verse 3:]
I make my music
Shit that I like music
Me being me
Original fight music
Our street music
Stayin to beef music
See a nigga shoot
You poppin your heat music
This not cam music
Nigga this is man music
First day home
Fresh out of the can music
Straight music
None of that mase music
Black bandana tied to your face music
Thug music nigga I'm not ludacris
Drunk music listen to how I'm doing this
Real music accept or refuse it
And ya'll already know exactly who it is

[Chorus:]
I ain't big homie
I ain't Jay-z
I can't do it like snoop
Baby that ain't me
I can be me
I'm a be me
I can't copy no man
I'm a be me
Look how diddy dance
I can't do that
And I don't wear my clothes
Like Jim Jones
You know that
I can only be me
I'm a be me
I can't be what I'm not
I'm a be me
