[Verse 1]
Everybody wanna be a shot caller, throw dollars
20 bottles in the club, big baller
Take pics on trips to Florida
Take a stripper out a club, then spoil her
Big dawg how you do it like that?
Got a hundred somethin' kis, how you move it like that?
I got a Benz and a Range, yeah ooh I like that
Say you gettin' money, we ain't heard about that, cuz
I ain't ever seen these niggas
Before Instagram, couldn't read these niggas
Never heard shit, don't believe these niggas
Wish it was a way I could delete these niggas
When I see 'em I don't greet these niggas
Like a ho, how I treat these niggas
Thinkin' to myself, how they breed these niggas?
I'm a G, why the fuck I wanna meet these niggas?
I'm the realest mothafucka in the game
Came in smellin' like cocaine
Jumped out, 'bout seven gold chains
And I don't even give a fuck about pain
These fake niggas, no way homes
They ain't on the street like pay phones
We gon' blow 'em up 'til they stay gone
Hustle hard, baby we don't let a day go

[Hook]
Big bank take little bank
One gold Rollie with a big face
Pull up in a Benz with a tint plate
On the way to court for a gun case
These niggas ain't ready
These niggas ain't ready
These niggas ain't ready
These niggas ain't ready

[Verse 2]
Wanna live like that? You ain't built like that
Fuckboy, let me tell you, you ain't real like that
You ain't thorough, I'm sorry that you feel like that
You ain't ready mothafucka, you get killed like that
Niggas act like they get it by the boatload
When you see 'em like, "Damn where the coke go?"
Big D when you see me in that 4 door
Stop talkin', let a hoe be a hoe though
I ain't ever heard of these niggas
No bet, I ain't sure of these niggas
I don't wanna hear a word from these niggas
Still talkin', the nerve of these niggas
Dippin' out of lanes on the interstate
Got food in the whip like a dinner plate
No sleep two days, boy I've been up late
Chase money, baby, I don't let it get away
Niggas ain't live that
Kilos, niggas ain't did that
Never let it blow 'til it sit back
Rob your own connect just to get back
Shorty said, "Damn Maino
See you in the cut like a band-aid though"
These niggas can't stand that though
Money on his head like a damn kangol

[Hook]
Big bank take little bank
One gold Rollie with a big face
Pull up in a Benz with a tint plate
On the way to court for a gun case
These niggas ain't ready
These niggas ain't ready
These niggas ain't ready
These niggas ain't ready
Big bank take little bank
One gold Rollie with a big face
Pull up in a Benz with a tint plate
On the way to court for a gun case
These niggas ain't ready
These niggas ain't ready
These niggas ain't ready
These niggas ain't ready

[Outro]
These niggas ain't ready
These niggas ain't ready
These niggas ain't ready
These niggas ain't ready
