[Hook x2]
This is the only life I know
This is the place that I call home
Nigga welcome to Brooklyn
Welcome to Brooklyn

[Verse 1: Billy Danze]
Brownsville, Brooklyn raised me
The only same nigga down here was Jay-Z
And that motherfucker ?? am I crazy
Choke ‘em a bitch, poke ‘em my nigga (kings county)
Bring all your bling
You crawl outta here without a motherfuckin' thang
That Ferrari, that Buggati
The Rolls Royce the bitch with the nice body
His ?? coverin' around that after party
We'll youtube some shit and call it the after party
Home of Midi Capone and Gotti
The original Murder Ink you better ask somebody
We’ll tell you what it is, the murder ??
Niggas will never make the trip
I gotta admit it, my city is pretty
Down the red eye to JFK
You can see my city glow

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Maino]
Welcome to Vietnam, so be alarmed
We gorillas, we in the jungle like Viet Cong
Young killers with fire arms that fire on
Frustrated my niggas ready to pop on
Explodin', baby face grow man
First day album, parole, smell like the bull pen
Spazatic, I smack niggas that laugh at it
Still at it, we push keys in bad traffic
The ruler, 25 shooters
OG selling me, y’all re ??? ???
Grew up in the era of crack dealin' and boosters
Gold chains, diamonds, is on me baby I ??
I ain’t talking with a ?? player
Tell 'em welcome to this city
Where the tech spray and ya need a neck brace
Look deep and see the x-ray
The K.O.B. are good around M.O.P. way

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Lil' Fame]
Brooklyn, it ain’t just a burrow it's a blood type
So keep ya snub tight if it's thug life
You young boyz wild like you ain't love life
The OG's will tell ya what it was like
Get caught up in a slug fight (ya heard)
Ain't nothing changed down here but the drug price
Actually, they call me The Great Gatsby
I put ya chest where ya back be
If you ain't wid it then we're about it
It's BK verse everybody
We on the frontline, dippin' from the one time
Hit you with that Nick Cannon, give you the drumline
Stay wildin', up in the club
Puffin' on loud, y'all niggas puffin' on silence
Violence, is a universal language
You done picked the wrong niggas to bang wid
