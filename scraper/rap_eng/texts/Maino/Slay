I came to slay (I came to slay)
I came to slay (I came to slay)
I stay with the muscle, that bag is OK
You done with the hustle, move out of my way
I came to slay (I came to slay)
No, I came to slay (I came to slay)

[Verse 1: Dream Doll]
Soon as I walk in the room
I'ma just light up the room
Look how I'm killing these bitches
I just bodied the room
I came to slay (I came to slay)
I came to slay (I came to slay)
I'm making the mess in this club
Move fuck out of my way
I came to slay, check out my gear
I came to stay, ain't going nowhere
Hating ass bitches ya better beware
Different breed over here, bitch, I am rare
I do not care, you can't compare
Foreign designers is all that I wear
Whipping that foreign, doors up in the air
I am monster, you better be scared, bitch
