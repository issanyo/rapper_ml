[Intro]
I can't get to where I need to get to trying to be these oth- tryna be one of these niggas
I can't do that
I can't be one of these niggas, son
I can't even- you know what I'm sayin', like
I can't even conform to some of this shit
But it's- but you know what I- you know what I realized, though?
I realized niggas love me more when I don't
When I stay doin' me and I'm in my lane and I'm givin' niggas that pain
Niggas love me more, my nigga
