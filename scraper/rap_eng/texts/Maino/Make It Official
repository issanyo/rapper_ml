[Verse 1: Maino]
You gon' make me cut my hoes off
You gon' make me turn my phone off
You gon' have me giving up my old ways
Got a player sitting out the whole game
Quit my baby mama for a new chick
Riding shotgun in a cool whip
Think I found her, ain't no quick love
And she the one that keep me out the strip club
And she the one that have me coming home yo
Name tatted on her, that's the one I own though
Move in with me, don't make it an issue
Here's a ring now, let's make it official

He talking like he wanna make it official
I'm like, word boo?
All them games you be playing
You lucky I didn't curve you
Make it official, baby
Big house, big ring
You chatting, nigga, I heard you
Ready to cuff, not playing no games
Passenger riding with you in all lanes
Quit your baby mama 'cause she's so lame
Till we done playing, tatted your whole name
Ride or die, be trapped in the block with you
From that hoopty, that Impala
Then straight to the drop with you
Stars is aligned, now straight to the top with you
No more games, sust wanna make it official
