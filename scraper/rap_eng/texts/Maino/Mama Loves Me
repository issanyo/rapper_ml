[Verse 1]
Look, picture you dreaming just to wake up to a nightmare
Picture you wishing but nobody in this life cares
The sound of pistols still ringing in my right ear
From a place where life ain’t worth a pair of Nike Airs
Getting tired, just to cover up the pain I’m in
Grab the mallet just to feel like I’m Jermaine again
Ghetto boys on them corner streets made us men
Forgive us all, it was the hunger that just made us sin
Sacrifices, feeling Christless, mornings like this, ducking indictments
Watching my homie just bleed till he was lifeless
Think about my cousin Doub on nights like this

[Hook]
Mama loves me, mama loves me
So why the fuck would I just let these niggas judge me
Couldn’t walk inside my shoes if you was me
And you can put that on the heavens, that’s above me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Papi say he want his brick back (what)
But we just split it like a Kit Kat
My homie told me once you take, you never give back
And what you reap is what you sow, you got to live that
So I’m addicted to this life, until the death of me
In the club letting strippers get the best of me
My dog gone from a bullet that was meant for me
Gotta live with it, can’t quit it, it’s my destiny
Getting rich and chasing bitches, drinking liquor
Count figures, taking bitches with my hittas
Hurt they feelings as I pull up on these niggas
With the same shit they see me with on Instagram and Twitter
So it’s death before dishonour
Yes we turned out well for some kids that had no fathers
From the prison cages where my friends can’t see their daughters
Worrying on the blocks, I was shooting on them corners, but

[Hook]
Mama loves me, mama loves me
So why the fuck would I just let these niggas judge me
Couldn’t walk inside my shoes if you was me
And even if you tried, you couldn’t budge me

[Verse 3]
I wonder if they listen when I’m gone
Who gon’ pay attention and correct me when I’m wrong
Feeling magnificent, they got me in a zone
Caught up in my suffering so this is not a song
This is, this is my life on these Pro Tools
From the start baby I relay the most ghouls
We need to stick together like it’s no room
Mothers lost so our black babies feelling so doomed
Day dreaming in that Rolls Royce
Roley gleaming, can’t believe I was a lost boy
It was simple, either starve, we had no choice
Screaming out, we had to write the wrong in my own voice
Help me see the bigger picture
Got a letter from my homie said he miss niggas
It’s crazy how the system is designed to twist niggas
So I try to use my life to inspire and lift niggas but

[Hook]
Mama loves me, mama loves me
So why the fuck would I just let these niggas judge me
Couldn’t walk inside my shoes if you was me
So you think I really care if you didn’t trust me

[Outro]
