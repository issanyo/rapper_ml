[Intro:]
If anybody ask you whether you in this game
You tell 'em you in it for life. Alright?
You play it hard, you play it tight
You make sure niggas know you gonna stand by your people

[Hook:]
It seems like the streets keep calling me
I'm just a fiend for my hood
Crooked police keep they eyes on me
But I won't leave my hood
Call me ghetto, call me goon
Call me gangster, but I call me hood
Call me convict, call me fool
Call me trouble, but I call me hood

[Verse 1:]
Ghetto boy, ghetto boy, wilding since a little boy
All I felt was pain, Lord please won't you send me joy
God must have heard my prayers, came to me in my dreams
It's been over 6 years and my mother's still clean
Oh-oh, oh-oh, that's right, I'm living my life
I'm in the street, right on my block
We chilling all night
So call me what you wanna call me
I been on 'em corners homie
Gun shots, tears drop
I done lost a couple homies
Victim of a violent hood
Product of a dirty slum
I ain't going back to jail
Already let them judge me once
Call me dumb, call me fool
Fine, you can call me stupid
Cause I come, flying through the hood
When I get some new shit
Grinding from crumbs man, I done what I could nigga
Look at me I made it out but still I'm just a hood nigga
Oh-oh, that's right, I'm feeling like I'm falling see
Every now and then I hear it, the streets is calling me

[Hook:]
It seems like the streets keep calling me
I'm just a fiend for my hood
Crooked police keep they eyes on me
But I won't leave my hood
Call me ghetto, call me goon
Call me gangster, but I call me hood
Call me convict, call me fool
Call me trouble, but I call me hood

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, packed jails, closed schools, over-crowded classrooms
College girls on stripper poles, feeling like we all doomed
Rock sellers, God tell us, why they let the cops kills us
Wouldn't understand unless you're standing on them blocks with us
Blood and tears, show no fear, candles for my dead peers
Pregnant teens, broken dreams, but I still love it here
Yes I said I love it here, take a breath, smell the air
Look around, feel the ground, you can sense the danger near
New babies, lost fathers, drugs inside the household
Alcohol, aids, rape, tell me something I don't know
Tell me where the hope is at
Real you can call me that
Never goin far away, the streets is always calling back

[Bridge:]
Even though I been the struggle, you can lose life in this struggle
My whole life was a struggle, that's all that I know
And I'm gone better my grind
And talk so I have to hustle
Money stays on my mind and I won't let it go
See this here is survival of the realest
And only if you real you will feel it
So if you don't live it, don't speak it
Make it hard for you to not see it

[Hook:]
It seems like the streets keep calling me
I'm just a fiend for my hood
Crooked police keep they eyes on me
But I won't leave [?] my hood
Call me ghetto, call me goon
Call me gangster, but I call me hood
Call me convict, call me fool
Call me trouble, but I call me hood
