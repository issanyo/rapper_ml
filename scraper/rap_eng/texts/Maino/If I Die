[Verse 1]
Look, half a million on cars
Who thought I’d ever make it
My face pressed to them bars
Sometimes I couldn’t take it
Had me questioning god
How come I’m so forsaken
Left emotionally scarred
Feel like my soul is shaken
All I had was drugs and hammers on me
Thought my life was doomed
It’s like the devil planned it for me
Now the diamonds all lit up
Like there’s candles on me
And I ain’t got no game
Some bitches understand my story
The road to riches
That’s probably what that C was thinking
Park the Bentley with the keys leave the hazards blinking
Started with an ounce and ended on a vegas strip
Taking all these niggas selfies with a famous bitch
S Car still tryna take a shot at life
Baby momma still screaming she’s a starter wife
Never been a fool homie I don’t owe a soul
The world is yours
Stage gleaming staring at the globe

[Hook]
So if I die my niggas
If I die, don’t even cry my nigga
If I die, don’t ask why my nigga
If I die, need you to ride my nigga
If I die, then bury me a G nigga
If I die, may they remember me nigga
If I die, don’t shed a tear for me baby
If I die, bottles in the air baby
If I die

[Verse 2]
I lay awake at night
And try to see my daughters dreams
She’ll never know
For me to feed her I did violent things
Battle tested I survived
That’s why it’s called the king
From a place where
Niggas kill you for your gold or bling
Yea, so if I bleed my niggas
Don’t even shed a tear
Was meant to be my niggas
I’ve done it all don’t need the creed my niggas
Been on stage with Alicia Keys my niggas
You gonna miss me when I’m gone is what I tell these hoes
You gonna beat me to the grave is what I tell my foes
Still balling feel alive when I’m with my woes
But out of 10 bands cooper still feel exposed
Yeah my life is like a Donald Goines novel
Dope dealing still sitting here hand on the bible
Fuck them all that’s exactly how I’m feeling lately
Still thugging cause these niggas don’t intimidate me

[Hook]
So if I die my niggas
If I die, don’t even cry my nigga
If I die, don’t ask why my nigga
If I die, need you to ride my nigga
If I die, then bury me a G nigga
If I die, may they remember me nigga
If I die, don’t shed a tear for me baby
If I die, bottles in the air baby
If I die, then bury me a G nigga
If I die, may they remember me nigga
If I die, don’t shed a tear for me baby
If I die, bottles in the air baby
If I die
