I rep hard for my crew
For the city I'm from
Raise the bar what it do
If you with me we one

When I get up get on
On that takeover grind
When the line it get drawn
I take it over it's mine

Tell me what is you on
What you pay for the price
Start with nothing and go on
Patiently wait for the right

Moment to get it oh
Just praying to stay in the light
That's just a day in the life

You know it been a minute boy I been this hot
Keep it day one, I been up in the spot
It ain't even a question, I'm gone win or not
Yeah, I swear on it all I'm gone get it, I
I'mma, I'mma, I'mma go hard
I'mma go hard
I'mma, I'mma, I'mma go hard
I'mma go hard
I'mma, I'mma, I'mma go hard
I'mma go hard
I'mma, I'mma, I'mma go hard
I'mma go hard
I'mma, I'mma, I'mma go

Ever since the beginning
I had envisioned it all
Take this life I've been given
And make it different than y'all

'Cause they ain't gonna hand it to you
Gotta get ya own
I made it to the top, I'm reppin' now
Let it be known

I'm right home in my city
Where them warriors roam
Put em up if you with me
Show 'em we came for the throne

I done beaten the odds
I'm praying to stay in the light
That's just a day in the life
