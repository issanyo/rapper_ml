[Intro: Stacy Barthe]
If I knew better, I would do better for you babe
Wish I knew better, then I wouldn't make the same mistakes

[Verse 1: Maino]
Late nights you up and I ain't home still
No text, my phone goin' to voicemail
Your inner thoughts sayin' you need to be goin' soon
I got the nerve to come in smellin' like perfume
Damn, is it really that I'm mixed up?
I'm thin like I lost somethin' at the strip club
Still playin' but my conscious yellin' grow up
Like a job, it's so hard to get a hoes up
Never thought that I ever would need a woman
The truth is I never learned how to treat a woman
And I don't really know what it's like to be a woman
But all I know one day my daughter's gon' be a woman
Can't lie, I'm a dog, I'm a cheater
Apologize for the times I mistreat you
And I keep sayin' sorry, you like whatever
Don't want you to leave but I know you deserve better

[Chorus: Stacy Barthe]
If I knew better, I would do better for you babe
Wish I knew better, then I wouldn't make the same mistakes
Oh, if I knew, if I knew, if only I knew
Then I would do better, better, better for you

[Verse 2: Maino]
Yeah, and I know you don't relate to the kind of pain I'm in
Battlin' my demons, just the ways of men
Good girl at home but these hoes ain't playin' fair
Fightin' temptation, keep me inside your prayers
I hate to see you hurt, that's true for what it's worth
And please never blame yourself for all my dirt, hey
I know you tired but you holdin' on
What'd I do, turned around and still do you wrong
Never too big to say I'm sorry
To the women in my life that had abortions by me
Wasn't able to be the man you needed
This life girl, I wasn't ready to leave it (you know it's true)
Your friends say why you takin' that?
They tell you to leave, don't ever take him back
I keep sayin' sorry, you like whatever
Don't want you to leave but I know you deserve better

[Chorus: Stacy Barthe]
If I knew better, I would do better for you babe
Wish I knew better, then I wouldn't make the same mistakes
Oh, if I knew, if I knew, if only I knew
Then I would do better, better, better for you
