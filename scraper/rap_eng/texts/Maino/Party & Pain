[Intro: Maino]
So I party just to take away the pain, hey

[Chorus: Maino]
So I party just to take away the pain
Shots of Patron make my problems go away
Stress in my life, so much pressure on my brain
Stripper said, 'relax baby, go 'head make it rain'
I need something for the pain, make it go away
Something for the pain, make it go away
I need something for the pain, make it go away
Something for the pain, make it go away

[Verse 1: Maino]
I need something for the pain, I need a glass of alcohol
Been going through some shit, don't wanna talk about at all
Got niggas say they love me, secretly they hope I fall
And I've been stressed out, a perfect reason just to ball
My baby mama trippin', move my daughter to LA
My mama in and out the hospital, I need to pray
These fuckin' industry niggas they owe me, need to pay
My son just asked me, 'dad how come you not as big as Dre?'
I need something for the pain, I need something just to zone
Just ordered twenty bottles, now we'll pitch 'em take it home
Addicted to these strippers, but they help me with my stress though
Blew my money tipping, probably could've bought a Benzo
I wanna feel numb, I don't wanna think about it
Another pain killer helps me to forget about it
A couple bottles of the champagne, it's for the pain
Fightin' sleep 'cause I wake up just to face it all again
I need something for the pain

[Chorus: Maino]
So I party just to take away the pain
Shots of Patron make my problems go away
Stress in my life, so much pressure on my brain
Stripper said, 'relax baby, go 'head make it rain'
I need something for the pain, make it go away
Something for the pain, make it go away
I need something for the pain, make it go away
Something for the pain, make it go away

[Verse 2: Dios Moreno]
Some nights I feel it the most
Like why do we dig up these ghosts?
Why do we dig up these graves?
It's crazy, knowin' it hinders the growth
I done lived in the house of the beast
Got hypnotized by the sounds of his teeth
We penalized and we rise to occasion
We are profiled and deprived of the basics
They emphasizing the crown of the blinds
The dominant dies, they got us on opposite sides
Demonic apocalypse times
It's oversymbolic, they target incompetent minds
Covered in lies, swerve under the carpet
Tools and the garbage designed
To keep us in darkness behind
But the penman, the strong will survive

[Chorus: Maino]
So I party just to take away the pain
Shots of Patron make my problems go away
Stress in my life, so much pressure on my brain
Stripper said, 'relax baby, go 'head make it rain'
I need something for the pain, make it go away
Something for the pain, make it go away
I need something for the pain, make it go away
Something for the pain, make it go away

[Outro: Maino]
I know all about the partyin', the girl music, that's cool I like that
Everybody know I love women and women love Maino
Everybody know that
I think every girl on this earth want me
That's what I believe
I walk in the room
I walk in the room my nigga, I think every bitch in the room want me, son
I think every bitch in the room like me, that's what I believe
