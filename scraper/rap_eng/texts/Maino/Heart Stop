Winners got a price to pay, if you wanna reach the top
Pushing hard night and day, you'll be running till your heart stops
How you gonna feel love in, when you race against the clock
Life ain't gonna come again, but you'll be running till your heart stops

Look, nobody told me winning hurts
It's the price you pay, guess that's why I'm feeling worse
Thought I gained the world but really lost everything
Trying to chase my dream had to sacrifice everything
Trying to beat time, missing time, out my son's life
Trying to make up for by buying things that my son likes
It was just a dream for me to be on tv now I'm here
I ain't got no time, my mama barely sees me
My priorities is getting twisted now my world is different
It's been fading day this distant, or
Is it true that I'm really just addicted
To that life, to that life, to the parties and the women
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I just wanted them to listen
I just wanted to blow up, wanted fame and the riches
Now I can't slow it down, still going non stop
I'm afraid to loose, still running till my heart stops

Whoa, winners got a price to pay, if you wanna reach the top
Pushing hard night and day, you'll be running till your heart stops
How you gonna feel love in, when you race against the clock
Life ain't gonna come again, but you'll be running till your heart stops

Picture self inside the shoes that my feet are in
And see exactly what it takes it takes in life just for you to win
Yeah I'm hustling selfish yeah I must have been
Guess this why I'm lonely, my relationships are suffering
I can have no girl when I'm trying to gain the world
When all she want is time and I ain't giving her my all
What am I supposed to do when friends say I've changed
And my living is so different, my surroundings ain't the same
I'm trying to make up times for that lost time
Try to make it to the top but really loosing more time
Loosing what I used to be, I ain't who I used to be
Staring in the mirror, get acquainted with the newer me
I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
Can't stop running, dear God it's a hard race
Gave up my happiness and joy for the lime life
Hope that the end just a [?] alright

Whoa, winners got a price to pay, if you wanna reach the top
Pushing hard night and day, you'll be running till your heart stops
How you gonna feel love in, when you race against the clock
Life ain't gonna come again, but you'll be running till your heart stops

Some things never change, go down like gravity
Can't stop you from the game, getting paid is the air you breathe
And every time I try you always turn to me
Say it's do or die, well listen to me, listen to me
[?] hear the bells ringing, time is running out, whoa, time is running out
If you think I'm playing boy you must be dreaming
Your time is ticking out, so love or leave me now, whoa

Whoa, winners got a price to pay, if you wanna reach the top
Pushing hard night and day, you'll be running till your heart stops
How you gonna feel love in, when you race against the clock
Life ain't gonna come again, but you'll be running till your heart stops
