[Chorus:]
Exotic women and foreign cars
We live the life of a movie star
The type of shit you see on big screens
You'll think it started with a big dream
Lavish life the flyest fashion
Billionaire talks that started happen
Now i'm finally living the
Hustler Fantasy (it was all a dream)
Hustler fantasy (look at my life you see what i mean)
Hustler fantasy (it was all a dream)
Hustler fantasy (you like it i love it nigga)

[Verse 1:]
You like it i love it
I started with nothing
Was locked in a dungeon
Now i party with Puffy
Models and divas, it's outa the rover
For 35 days i had to be sober
I dreamt of these days
Woke up im proud of my hustle
For so many days all i could see was the struggle
Now i'm dining with women making they living on tv
No block in my vision, top of the world i can see me
Close my eyes and picture the falls
White sand, blue water, im picturing more
Holding ciroc though im helping my addiction or hers
Big dreams, give me wings i'm ready to soar

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
My fantasy rich, my memory poor
Just pass me the ball, i'm fixing the score
She open up wide, let her swallow the sword
Told her welcome to heaven, let her speak to the lord
Got clouds in my view. The top of the globe
Take me away from the haters, just leave me the hoes
On my way to the riches, on a yellow brick road
Throwing dollars in the air while she spin on the pole
My bitches is mixed, my vehicles foreign
I peel off her panties, like skin off an orange
We party tonight, then sleep in the morning
My fantasy's vivid, i need it i want it

[Chorus]
