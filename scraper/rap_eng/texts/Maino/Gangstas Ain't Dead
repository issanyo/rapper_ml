Unstoppable, ah
Keep my enemies close, my enemies more closer
I ain't a celebrity baby, I'm a soldier
Gangstas ain't dead we here, thugging ain't over
Whatever don't kill me only making me stronger [x2]
Gangstas ain't dead, get on stronger
Gangstas ain't dead, it ain't over
Gangstas ain't dead, it ain't over


Yeah, I'm so g'd up, I'm so g'd up
Even with a deal, I know what I need some
I just wanna live, stay fresh, stacking my g's up
Any day I'm ready to shoot my enemies up
Shout out to my riders, [?] and lifers
Waiting on the day when they ready to reignite us
Always keep in mind that these niggas ain't nothing like us
Look at how they snitching, they lying, trying to [?] us
Going in them trucks, them minivans is bulletproof [?]
With the mac on my lap, that's how the killers do
You can tell the way that I talk that I'm a reall nigga
Just cause he come from the hood don't make him street nigga
I just see the look in they eyes, I'm what they trying to be
Never thought I'd be the last of a dying breed
Couldn't leave the streets alone that's why I'm strapped up
Every time you see me, I'm always black flagged up
Unstoppable, ah


Keep my enemies close, my enemies more closer
I ain't a celebrity baby, I'm a soldier
Gangstas ain't dead we here, thugging ain't over
Whatever don't kill me only making me stronger [x2]
Gangstas ain't dead, get on stronger
Gangstas ain't dead, it ain't over
Gangstas ain't dead, it ain't over
Gangstas don't die, just take a look at me


Black flag, definition of how a crook should be
Black flag, ain't no surprise, my nigga shooking me
I act bad, I can't explain why you just a hood nigga
From sun down to sun up, we gun down, you run up
You dumb fuck, it's too hard to come down
From bk to va, they know me, jsut replay
Throw it in the pot, bring it back like a dj
I [?] I'm crazy, I'm psycho
[?] gunning with my 22, rifle
I'm [?] they feel me, I'm next
My enemies mad, they can't kill me, I'm blessed
I know that you see me just little closer
Moving with the weight of the world on my shoulder
A memory a [?] nah it ain't over
Your spirit here forever and ever cause you're a soldier


Keep my enemies close, my enemies more closer
I ain't a celebrity baby, I'm a soldier
Gangstas ain't dead we here, thugging ain't over
Whatever don't kill me only making me stronger [x2]
Gangstas ain't dead, get on stronger
Gangstas ain't dead, it ain't over
Gangstas ain't dead, it ain't over
Last of a breed that's dying
I did it all, flag scenes with hot iron
To loose a couple hundred k on a [?]
To drive whipping in the park [?] frying
Let it shizzle, whatever I scribble was the truth
No fake g's make words riddle
They [?] like 2 grands, [?]
Hollywood dead, [?] black in the [?]
But they [?] 's mine, my niggas stand strong
In the presence of G's, clowns feel small
We don't fall, all my niggas is stand straight
We stand out, in the industry of pan cakes
And when 2 get out the clank
I'm a be right at the gates, screaming money in the bank
Hustle hard nigga


Keep my enemies close, my enemies more closer
I ain't a celebrity baby, I'm a soldier
Gangstas ain't dead we here, thugging ain't over
Whatever don't kill me only making me stronger [x2]
Gangstas ain't dead, get on stronger
Gangstas ain't dead, it ain't over
Gangstas ain't dead, it ain't over
