I know, I know, that you're tired
Yeah you feeling so uninspired
You been searching for long, now I finally come
Here I am, I'm your Messiah
Oho, oho, oho, oho
Oho, oho, oho, oho
Oho, oho, oho, oho, oho

Yeah, where it comes from now?
Cause when I look around, I see a circus like Wrigley Brothers [?] ground
Too many characters, the game is like a tv show
I can't believe I see rappers wearing women clothes
Now where my city at? We hanging off the map
Too many lames screaming they gonn' bring my city back
I own identity, something that my city lacks
What happened to the truth, tell me how real is that
I know what you want, I know what you need
I can hear the thoughts, I'm inside your dreams
I'm the [?] and I finally got the right prescription
Come on and follow me, I'll lead you to the right religion
It's like God's eyes, seeing with that type of vision
I know what we lack and what we got and what we listen
I'm the difference, I'm the chosen, baby I'm the one
I know you been waiting for me and I finally come

I know, I know, that you're tired
Yeah you feeling so uninspired
You been searching for long, now I finally come
Here I am, I'm your Messiah
Oho, oho, oho, oho
Oho, oho, oho, oho
Oho, oho, oho, oho, oho

Yeah, look, tell me where's the fire, I know you tired
God help us all, save us from these fucking liars
Either you got a mean [?] with them
The only way these niggas been around was to the gym
The whole game is now in question, what's the answer though?
You seeking all the dumb shit while I'm the antidote
This is honesty, I was taught to speak my mind
Go ahead and try I'm the truest nigga you gonna find
Voice of the hood, I speak for the streets
The young single mothers who gave birth to g's
This is it, this is exactly what the doctor ordered
[?] get these niggas what they wanted
I'm a miracle, I said it and they never cord it
They won't believe till I show them I can walk on water
I'm the difference, I'm the chosen, baby I'm the one
I know you been waiting for me and I finally come

I know, I know, that you're tired
Yeah you feeling so uninspired
You been searching for long, now I finally come
Here I am, I'm your Messiah
Oho, oho, oho, oho
Oho, oho, oho, oho
Oho, oho, oho, oho, oho

Look, I'm only here just to face up all the damages
The hand of God, I'm a discipline the savages
I've been heaven sent cause you niggas negligent
I stepped up when nobody else would represent
The underdog, they ain't seeing what I got in stored
They said the game is [?] dope, all I got is wrong
M the difference, I'm the chosen, baby I'm the one
I know you been waiting for me and I finally come

I know, I know, that you're tired
Yeah you feeling so uninspired
You been searching for long, now I finally come
Here I am, I'm your Messiah
Oho, oho, oho, oho
Oho, oho, oho, oho
Oho, oho, oho, oho, oho [x2]
