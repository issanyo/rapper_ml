[Verse 1: PUSH!]

I know people I ain’t the criminal that you used to
Move smart, can’t be in a cell or cooped up
Careful when I move stuff, see how I maneuver
I’m about this loot bruh, could never be a loser
Music like drugs and the fans is my users
Samples of this dope, trying to get some new abusers
One for the sniffers and one for the shooters
Stone cold hustler, looked in the eyes of Medusa
Through the same shades Biggie had
PUSH! is the future
Main dropped “Hi Hater” the team we done moved up
Still will hit the streets and blam heat at you poo-puts
Put your whole clan under the white sheets like the Ku Klux
Black flag, black tech, black mag
Hit your chest shot back fag, disrespect we will not have
They got mad, the flow nasty like a snot rag
But fuck that nigga, show us where the spot’s at

[Hook] (x2)

That’s just how the game go
What you think we slang for?
Trying to put that mo-mo-mo-mo-money in the bank yo
That’s just how the games go
Ducking from the plain clothes
Trying to put that mo-mo-mo-mo-money the bank yo

[Verse 2: Maino]

I think like a radical, move just like a militant
Whenever niggas see me they nervous and get to trembling
Bitches think I’m sexy, the industry say I’m criminal
People think I’m crazy, the haters say I ain’t lyrical
But who you think the killers and real niggas gonna listen to?
They know that I’m 100 and none of yall believable
Killed competition, I got em just by a landslide
They ain’t fucking with me like stepping onto a landmine, boom!
Black bandanas is in the room
I speak for the thugs the voice of every goon
I run with the vultures, prove that I’m a soldier
I don’t claim a set but I embrace the gang culture
What did you expect when you niggas flirting with death?
You could see it my way or see the front of my tech
It’s a movement, one wrong move will get your brain split
It’s hustle hard, money in the bank bitch

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: PUSH!]

My young broad telling me I need to go out more
No time trying to bigger than all out doors
It’s a drought right now, waiting on the downpour
I’m about my paper little lady you about yours
Got a couple rap dollars but I’m trying to count more
Industry fight funny, had to go southpaw
It’s a new era, got the same cap Jay wore
Married to the streets, my in-laws is outlaws
Related by blood to the homies that’s thug
And the shorties that take trips, ride with the drugs
Ain’t got no kind of love for the rats and the snitches
They can’t stand to witness us go from rags to riches
Stay focused shun, forget the baddest of the bitches
That will come later, what matters is the business
Follow me homie, I eat, breathe and shit this
And you can grab everything that’s on your wishlist

[Hook] (x2)
