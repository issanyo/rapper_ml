[Intro]
Nobody owns me though. That's 'cause I own my own company and my company sells a product that's better than the competition at a price that's lower

[Hook: F School Telli]
Believe half of what you see, and nothing that you heard
Believe half of what you see, and nothing that you heard
One time for the plug, for turnin' me up
Now I'm that nigga you gotta come see, re-up
My day ones, they A1
They ready for beef, ready to eat and ready for war
My day ones, they A1
They ready for beef, ready to eat and ready for war

[Verse 1: Maino]
Ready for beef, ready for war
Ready to eat, tell papi we finished, we ready for more
Ready for business, so we ready to get it
Homie jumped out of his Wraith and said
"Fuck it, they comin', I'm ready for prison"
All of my niggas is dealers
All of my life I've been rollin' with killers
Knowin' that one day the feds'll come get us
Now that we ballin', hope God can forgive us
I just been clubbin' 5 days in a row
Caught up in all of these bottles and hoes
Hop out of cars that we bought off of coke
Maybe we willing to die for the gold
I wanna send a shout out to the plug
We was just tryna get rich off of drugs
When we went broke, papi thought it was love
Robbed our connect and said, "Get it in blood"
Prayin' to God that they send me a kilo
So I can style on these niggas like Nino
Knowin' these niggas don't want it with me though
No, these niggas don't want it with me though

[Hook: F School Telli]
One time for the plug, for turnin' me up
Now I'm that nigga you gotta come see, re-up
My day ones, they A1
They ready for beef, ready to eat and ready for war
My day ones, they A1
They ready for beef, ready to eat and ready for war

[Verse 2: Maino]
Ready to roll, ready to ride
Nigga said, "Maino I love you
Forever, for you I'd be ready to die"
So we ready to try, like we ready to fly
First time I touched me a brick
I dropped down to my knees, I was ready to cry
Love all my niggas, I love 'em for life
Us against them 'til we hit it with Christ
Life is a gamble, we rollin' the dice
[?] by the end of the night
Never argue for ours
We just got cars and moved on
The same tats on our arms
Nigga we really the mob
Homie, we started from dirt
Hustled on days when [?] work
Glad that I seen a few friends leave the earth
Reason we drinkin' champagne, 'cause it hurts
Pour somethin' out for my homies
Call 'em my brothers, I love all my homies
Never let niggas talk down on my homies
I would go lay somethin' down for my homies

[Hook: F School Telli]
One time for the plug, for turnin' me up
Now I'm that nigga you gotta come see, re-up
My day ones, they A1
They ready for beef, ready to eat and ready for war
My day ones, they A1
They ready for beef, ready to eat and ready for war
