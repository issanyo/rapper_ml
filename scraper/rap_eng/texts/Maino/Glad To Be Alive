Feeling like a king, rolling on that new Porsche
Hand on the steering wheel, drowning in my own thoughts
Photos in my mind, pictures of my dead friends
Thinking bout the time when we was just some kids
Then caught up in the life, we was far from innocent
Many different nights, and life could have been the end
Take a deep breath and inhale all the fresh air
Think about life it's a blessing just to be here
Phone calls for my dogs that's behind bars
Trying to keep hope, 20 years to the parole board
God damn, repercussions of the game
You go from a bench to a number and a name
A big homie wrote me a [?]
5 years of balling they worth to a life
So never give up only losers don't try
Don't look back thank God that you're alive

My hat real low, money on my mind
Dance till 7 got a model in my ride
I got homies in the pen, homies in the sky
Think about the drama in my life that I survived
I'm just glad to be alive, glad to be alive
Pop another bottle, we gonna celebrate tonight
I'm just glad to be alive, glad to be alive
Fuck what you saying I'm just glad to be alive

Glad to be breathing, enjoying my freedom
Hugging my son, me telling him I need him
Looking in his eyes while I try to blend his future
Praying that he never does the things that I used to
He won't be no dope boy, not a gun clapper
He won't go to jail he'll be better than a rapper
Many tears lost on my home boys caskets
Fatherless sons in this world young bastards
Holding on my champagne bottle as I think back, hustling
In and out of town man I did that
Picture me sitting in the cell through the night
On the floor quiet sharpening my knife
Product of a violent neighborhood and a ghetto
Got above the street but it seems I can't let go
Many different times that I could have been gone
But I got a chance, to really live on

My hat real low, money on my mind
Dance till 7 got a model in my ride
I got homies in the pen, homies in the sky
Think about the drama in my life that I survived
I'm just glad to be alive, glad to be alive
Pop another bottle, we gonna celebrate tonight
I'm just glad to be alive, glad to be alive
Fuck what you saying I'm just glad to be alive

Yeah, I survived drugs, I survived beats
I survived shoot outs in the middle of the street
I watched thug niggas go to jail and turn sweet
I watched friends die told my son that they was sleep
Feels like we in up in the grave or in the feds
Praying 80 gets the feeling back in his legs
Could have been laid on the ground but now it's dead
But it wasn't in the plan, it was meant for me to live

My hat real low, money on my mind
Dance till 7 got a model in my ride
I got homies in the pen, homies in the sky
Think about the drama in my life that I survived
I'm just glad to be alive, glad to be alive
Pop another bottle, we gonna celebrate tonight
I'm just glad to be alive, glad to be alive
Fuck what you saying I'm just glad to be alive
