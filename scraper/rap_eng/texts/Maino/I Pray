[Verse 1: Maino]
I make music for lost niggas
Young bitches with babies by drug dealers
Heaven help us they letting them cops kill us
Black talons we loading them cop killers
Shorty told me he thugging that's what it is
Around the wrong niggas, he got shot up he didn't live
Try to teach him I try to lead him and give him hope
Give these street niggas proper vision, a way to go
I pray for my people hoping we make it
I pray for tomorrow hoping I face it
I pray that my homies finally free
I pray that my son is better than me
From a place where these politicians is crooks
Lebron dreams but end up like Lenny Cook
Cautionary tale for Latino and black males
Headed for these dark early graves and packed jails
What's the difference on that rail
My homey couldn't read but made millions off crack sales
Still trapping finding a way out
The summers hot so I'm ready I brought the K out
I pray that I finally get what I'm worth
I pray that I kill my enemies first
I pray for a lot of millions I'm holding
I pray that these bitches picture me rolling
She said she was trying to make it through college
Two kids, no help, dancing for dollars
Still lost these daughters searching for fathers
Running wild my young shooters need guidance
Still city, drug dealing on God's earth
Can't hear on my mama screaming keep God first
A dope fiend with wounds, he said his scars hurt
Couldn't beat his addiction, said it's Allah's curse
I pray for a healthy life and riches
I pray that these haters find 'em some business
I pray that they see me hop out the Wraith
I pray that these agents don't come today
I got to get something niggas to follow
Ten bottles, these bitches followin' sparkles
Live life on the edge, pray for tomorrow
Getting out of the hood's winning the lotto
For my niggas in the trap who as real as me
Slipped up and got nabbed on conspiracy
End up co-defendants on a chow line
Guess we just promised death or some jail time
I pray for my dead homies in heaven
I pray that they angels send me a blessing
I pray that I'm never dying with fear
I pray that I kill these niggas this year
