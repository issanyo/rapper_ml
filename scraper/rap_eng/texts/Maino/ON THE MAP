[Intro: Maino]
Yeah, what up Flawless ?
You already know who did it
New York city all the way to Canada
Brooklyn, [?]

[Verse 1: Maino]
Ennemy of my ennemy
Turns out to be a friend of me
Pray hard, wish death on 'em
Celebrate with Hennessy
Motivated by jealousy
Be ready ! they better be
Cause I'm ready to hurt niggas
I cross niggas, [?]
They don't know what my life's like
Big city, bright lights
Drug money and that Goyard
Party hard, that's night life
Wake up and feel like "oh no"
In bed with hoes I don't know
Tattoos on torso, Spanish chick, [?]
Guess I had too much alcohol
Goin hard in Montreal
Just know I brought killers with me
Stand back and watch [?] ball
Popped up with a actress
Couldn't understand her accent
Never wanted no handouts
I stands out like a fat bitch
I'm a god to these old niggas
Got mine, still [?] niggas
Your watch gone and [?] niggas
Only love my home niggas

[Verse 2: Flawless]
