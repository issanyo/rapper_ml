I smell like pussy and cologne, pussy and cologne
And I been running around my city with my bitches getting low
‘Cause I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
Yeah I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I smell like pussy and cologne, pussy and cologne
And I been running around my city with my bitches getting low
‘Cause I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
Yeah I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it

[Verse One: Maino]
I smell like pussy and patron, pussy and patron
And I’m running round this club, thinking what bitch I’m bringing home
I’m a big deal in my city, got a blonde bitch I call Brittany
Got some real friends, some fake friends and a black Benz I call Diddy
Got a bad bitch who got a bad bitch, I stretch out like elastic
My dick big and my money long, got guns under my mattress
I’m about mine, it’s about time, my jewels light up at night time
My shit hard, the realest out, go kill yourself if you don’t like mine
Black flagging, red sagging, shirt off, in the club spazzing
Two bitches, one suite, taking turns, they both gagging
I got it, I got it, a house the size of my wallet
A redbone with a Mohawk and a pistol in my pocket
And my girl was waiting home, my girl was waiting home
She said I smell like pussy, said no bitch, that’s my cologne

[Verse Two: Emilio Rojas]
I smell pussy, a lot of motherfuckers in the room wanna talk
But they won’t do shit, I smell pussy, everybody around me
Now they running at the mouth and they gonna get hit, I smell pussy
Bitch, you a little man, an assistant to ‘em, a dependent man
And he gonna fire your ass on those taxes, you a part of the refund
Now that they giving it back and there’s a lot of people that done gotten egos
And they not deserving, they forgot to earn it so I’m waking up
And never gave a fuck if you dead ‘cause I never been a morning person
You roll with bitches you can’t fuck, no game, it’s just bad luck
And she next to you but she texting me about sexing me in that bathroom
And I’m laughing at you, trying to burn me, y’all bitches never learn
See, I know y’all are pussy and your crew is pussy
So your team is not a Twerk Team and that team with me will be the legal team
For them contracts that they feed to me and they translate what they mean to me
‘Cause Rosetta Stone don’t speak illegalese, we don’t lease ‘cause we buying
She leave with me ‘cause she eying, she came with you but never came with you
So to stay with you, she not trying, yeah, everybody getting paid in the game
But the lames know Emilio defiant, you getting bread
You getting women wet so that pussy scent will be my scent

[Verse Three: Paypa]
I smell like pussy and cologne, you say Lyryla home
Bad redbone from the ATL trying to give me that Georgia dome
Fuck me good at Patchwork, suck me down at Tree Sound
Gave her all my Kevin Love, we can box out on the rebound
Riding through the city, D6 came to get me
Had a Barbie with him, ass poke out like Nicki
I hit her on a starship, she said you see right through me
Nigga, that’s why you mad? She wrap my shit like Tunechi
My whole crew be slacking groupies, we into making movies
She say that I’m so icy, I cream her face like Gucci, burr
She give me that round of applause, I go Waka Flocka
Left my jays on, you know my kick game just like soccer
I’m from a big city with a big buzz, blue collar like a crip would
My Air Maxes ’97, notorious like Big was
And I’m all about getting that green, I hustle hard like a rookie
Revenge is the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
