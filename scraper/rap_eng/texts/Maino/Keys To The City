[Verse 1: Maino]
Woke up feeling like I had the key to the city
Bitches out in Brooklyn, boy, they treat me like I’m Diddy
Catch me jumping out of Bentley’s but I’m still with it
Screaming “fuck them other niggas” I salute whoever with me
The realest in the world but they say I’m underrated
Running through the city with a crown, I’m the greatest
Mac 11 in the seven, like I ain’t famous
You can hate it if you want, that I fuck bitches that are A-list
I know they remember me, I ain’t no celebrity
You know what my feelings are, motherfuck this industry
Do this for the niggas that be trafficking, coke white as Aspirin
Homie came home and had to pick up both his gats again
Hopped out with Giuseppe's on, back up in the trap again
My shawty that be swiping get her numbness from the Africans
Gang leader, more stripes than Adidas
Got a text from your girl, asking me where I wanna meet her

[Hook: Maino]
I woke up feeling like I got the keys to the city
Screaming money over bitches ‘til them people come and get me
Oh Lord, [?] started from the bottom with a penny
Screaming “fuck them other niggas” I salute whoever with me
I salute whoever with me (with me, with me) whoever with me (with me)
Screaming “fuck them other niggas” I salute whoever with me (with me, with me)
Bitch, yeah I started with a penny
Woke up feeling like I got the keys to the city

[Verse 2]
I woke up feeling like I got the keys to the city
Got them wilding and them skinny niggas know that I get busy
Keep a fully loaded semi on me, I don’t know who with me
Shit I’m paranoid, I feel like everybody tryna get me
Oh Lord, them niggas iffy with my peoples, I’m picky
In a Bentley, I was made to win, the product sitting pretty
Yeah we bumping Biggie, ‘bout to re-up on the biggie
And shout the homie eighty, he the street version of Diddy
We just tryna feed the family, niggas still bout the committee
Motherfuckers so clean, but how them niggas so gritty?
Moving on this work until them people come and get me
Connect calling said he got the keys to the city

[Hook: Maino]
I woke up feeling like I got the keys to the city
Screaming money over bitches ‘til them people come and get me
Oh Lord, [?] started from the bottom with a penny
Screaming “fuck them other niggas” I salute whoever with me
I salute whoever with me (with me, with me) whoever with me (with me)
Screaming “fuck them other niggas” I salute whoever with me (with me, with me)
Bitch, yeah I started with a penny
Woke up feeling like I got the keys to the city

[Verse 3: Tweezie]
I woke up feeling like I got the keys to the safes
Feel the hate on your breath, don’t even breathe in my face
My food in my hand, I don't need me a plate
Hustle hard, so this paper is easy to make
Yeah, look at Main as he wear his crown
We some stand-up niggas, we don’t dare sit down
So keep your chairs, I don't need your applause
Tying niggas up is how we even the score
You riding the what? Get the toast, no butter and
It’s clear you could die here, no coloring
So stubborn and, nigga I don’t budge
Only time I lie is in the bed and to the judge

[Hook: Maino]
I woke up feeling like I got the keys to the city

Oh Lord, [?] started from the bottom with a penny
Screaming “fuck them other niggas” I salute whoever with me

Screaming “fuck them other niggas” I salute whoever with me (with me, with me)
Bitch, yeah I started with a penny
Woke up feeling like I got the keys to the city
