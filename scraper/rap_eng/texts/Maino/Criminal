[Intro: Maino]
All I ever been was a criminal
Maino left the street's it's a miracle

[Hook: Maino]
All I ever been was a criminal
Niggas said Maino left the street's it's a miracle
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs alone
If you know the words, won't you sing along
Ehey, ehey, now
Ehey, ehey, now
Ehey, ehey, now
Ehey, ehey, now

[Verse 1: Maino]
Rolling through the city in my big wheel
Raindrops dancing on my windshield
I can see the future in on plane view
While my past is peeking though my rear view
It's a miracle, how I made it out the slums
They said I'll be dead before I'm 21
Look ma, here's a gift from your oldest son
Never had a house so I'm bout to buy you one
Cause I remember days we needed help
Now it's champagne on the shelf
Trying to balance fame and the wealth, made a name for myself
But tell me what's important, the game or my health
So this is for the ones that remember me before rap
Where my only source of money came from home crack
Young boy, big heart, quit the click clack
Misled, little head and a big hat

[Hook: Maino]

[Verse 2: Maino]
Niggas saying I ain't really lyrical
It's cool if you don't get it, it ain't meant for you
You never faced the judge when he sentences you
You couldn't walk a mile in my Louis shoes
I used to play the block trying to dodge the D's
Ask Bird, ask Cream, they remember me
They remember me and Dog and that blue Ford
No class pants holding up that 44
Young and wild, headed for that B now
Before I knew it, I was in that pen wild
No music, way before the videos
Nikiya came to see me on the visit yo
Can't forget Fatty and Serena
Used to write me letters, it helped me keep my head up
I was trapped in, but you had my back then
Green prison clothes, I ain't even rap then

[Hook: Maino]

[Verse 3: Maino]
Yeah, things different for me, people listen to me
Little girls they see me, and snap pictures of me
You never know, never say never
Used to think that I will be in the street forever
Me and mouse yup, me and Seino
Early 90's baby what up to Gino
Laying back, pretty women bring me breakfast
Thinking back I kept the Tech and the Lexus
No record deal, just a big dream
Hoping the coke will bring me everything
Cause all I ever been was a criminal
You either end up in jail or in a funeral
Shout out to the homies I grew up with
Used to shoot, used to rob, sell drugs with
Bad choices, good friends turn to memories
Still the same, still Maino, I remember me

[Hook: Maino]
