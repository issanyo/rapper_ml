[Verse 1: Maino]

Yeah, Lemme get it like this listen the industry got Drake but the streets got me
Watch em praise others and then deny me
At 1st I was saying to myself, "Well why me?"
Than I thought about it, they simply not me
Just what I expected, how can I accept this
Held my whole city down I'm still not accepted
Maybe I ain't write enough, songs ain't tight enough
"full blooded weirdo, pants ain't tight enough
Going to hard Maino, you need to lighten up"
Never that I'mma speak my mind keep winding up
Black flag wrapped on my face on my billboard
Look around Diddy got a flag on his face y'all
Is this reality, or my imagination?
But niggas really watching me is my evaluation
Watching how I move captivated by the thug in me
Studying my music and act like they don't fuck with me
Look at me, please don't let these pussy niggas fool you
Even if you hatin' gotta love me cuz I'm truthful
Too real too hard put that on my mama dog, deep down
Everyone loves an underdog

[Chorus: Maino/Some chick] (X2)
Even if you hate to admit it
You gotta love me
Did it by myself no help
You gotta love me
I done make somethin' from nothin'
You gotta love me

[Verse 2: Maino]

If I tell you whats on my mind, they gon' say I'm angry
Tell you I'mma spazz out they gon' say I'm crazy
Should I take it personal? I feel life trynna play me
Or maybe I should brush it off just the way this game be
Came in this game all black no mistaken that HOV got on all black
I said it am I hatin'?
Look at all these hypocrites
Think that I don't see this shit
I ain't in they circle I be on some different shit
I be on my own all alone like an exile
Yes I ain't cool enough to fit in with the in crowd
Is he such a bad dude? Look at all his tattoos?
I heard he got a temper is it true he like to smack dudes?
This what they be asking they whisper while I'm passing
Forget that I'm the only New York nigga with the smash hits
In your eyes you realize you can't fuck with me
I re'd-up now you bitch niggas stuck with me

[Chorus: Maino/Some chick] (X2)
Even if you hate to admit it
You gotta love me
Did it by myself no help
You gotta love me
I done make somethin' from nothin'
You gotta love me

[Verse 3: Maino]

Yeah, the streets got me how can they choose them and not acknowledge me?
At 1st I was saying to myself well why me? than I thought about it, its simply not me
Just what I expected these niggas got they eye on me
They don't want to let me in they secret society
I can hear the tune in they voice that they follow me
Then they turn around and purposely not acknowledge me
You ain't gotta holler speak cuz you could never stop me
Hit you with consistency I'mma make you watch me, watch me
Nothing in the world to make me fuck with you
How you really hate me, I'm so so loveable

[Chorus: Maino/Some chick] (X2)
Even if you hate to admit it
You gotta love me
Did it by myself no help
You gotta love me
I done make somethin' from nothin'
You gotta love me
Go
