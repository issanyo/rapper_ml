(Steady are you ready)
However do you need me
However do you want me [x5]
(Hustle Hard!)

Look! Keep Pushing like I ain't gotta care
I come from the bottom like I'm never going back there
It's only uphill I know how the ground feels
Can't sleep when I'm day dreaming on a mill
Waking up broke I ain't have nothing
I'm a sell anything for me to make something
Money in a prada bag, prince in a beemer
Feeling like I'm only ever gonna be drug dealer
Look nigga, never had much as a child
That's why I'm in the club spending money now
You ever seen a nigga make history
Look at me I'm living testimoney

However do you need me
However do you want me [x5]

Look came a long way from hsutling for thousands
In and out of jail could'ntkeep for... long
Now I'm taking pictures with a smile on
It's a big fat winny with the crown on
I can see the world the s65
Push a button and it feels like I'm in the sky

[? ]
Going back to nothing is a nightmare
Getting high getting twisted in them cali hills
Plenty bitches just imagine how that gotta feel
You can tell I want it; you can tell I need it
I'm a win, nigga you can see it

However do you need me
However do you want me [x5]

Back to life; back to reality [x4]
(My Reality yeaaah!)

Look my reality is to take it the top dog
Why do you think I made it off the block for
Could've been in the cage knocked off
But I'm a rise like a rocket when it pops off
All I see and dream of is sucess
I can't even think of nothing less
I'm a proof of what a street dream is
However do you want it; get it how you live
