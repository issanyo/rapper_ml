[Intro: DJ Druskee]
New York City, I need you to get ready
It's Druskee reporting from live from the studio
And the national weather service has issued a heat wave coming to the city
So expect heavy heat and humidity to continue as the weeks begin
And remember to keep cool
Drink lots of water, and check on friends and family
Because when this heat wave hits, it's gonna get real!

[Pre-hook: Maino]
Woo!
Let's go!
Heard you. (Heard you)
Hahaha
Woo
Let's go!

[Hook: Maino]
Big diamonds in the rollie! (Heard you)
I been gettin' to the money! (Heard you)
Pull up in a foreign! (Heard you)
Nigga see me ballin' (Heard you)
Walk up in the club and it's so lit
Come through, then I take another nigga bitch (Heard you)
Motherfucker I heard you
Motherfucker I heard you

[Verse 1: Maino]

Yea! Talk killa shit
Never let 'em play me, not a little bit
Tell them strippers that I'm comin' with the rent money
I'm about to blow a new Benz money
Tell 'em bring the bottles with the Rose
Excuse me homie, but you standin' in a hoe's way
Goddamn, got me feelin' like a new nigga
Still fuck my old bitch like I'm her new nigga
Still ballin' on these suckas
Switchin' up, different foreigns on these suckas
See you hatin' even though we know you love us
You was never gettin' paper, no you wasn't
Shortie I just wanna spend the night witcha
You ain't poppin' till they see a nigga wife witcha
Tell them bitches get in with the program
When I met her she ain't look the same on Instagram


[Hook: Maino]
Big diamonds in the rollie! (Heard you)
I been gettin' to the money! (Heard you)
Pull up in a foreign! (Heard you)
Nigga see me ballin' (Heard you)
Walk up in the club and it's so lit
Come through, then I take another nigga bitch (Heard you)
Motherfucker I heard you
Motherfucker I heard you

[Verse 2: Maino]
I been goin' harder
Pull up with the same watch as Shawn Carter
Feel like Nino at the Carter
Tell these haters you can't stop me, why bother
All tatted like a young Crip
Left with three, but I came outside with one bitch
I'm the realest nigga anyway
Party like we ball players when we celebrate
Think I fell in love with a scammer though
She got me Tom Ford and Valentino though
Chasin' money, that's a mission doggie
Bitches watchin' when they see the diamonds glisten on me
Do it for the homies in the prison system
I fuck famous hoes and take pictures of 'em
Shortie said she never been to Brooklyn nigga
But she think she fell in love with a Brooklyn nigga


[Hook: Maino]
Big diamonds in the rollie! (Heard you)
I been gettin' to the money! (Heard you)
Pull up in a foreign! (Heard you)
Nigga see me ballin' (Heard you)
Walk up in the club and it's so lit
Come through, then I take another nigga bitch (Heard you)
Motherfucker I heard you
Motherfucker I heard you
