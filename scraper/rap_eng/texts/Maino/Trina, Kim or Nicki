[Chorus]
Trina, Kim Or Nicki, Trina, Kim Or Nicki, Trina, Kim Or Nicki
Which one is comin with me?
Trina, Kim Or Nicki, Trina, Kim Or Nicki, Trina, Kim Or Nicki
Which one is comin with me?

[Verse One]
I'm fresh, I'm fly, bad bitch in my ride
Got a different industry chick all in my mind
I'm calm, I'm hood, ev'rything all good
When I'm finished with you you can call me Tiger Woods
Yeah! Trina, Kim Or Nicki, Trina, Kim Or Nicki
She smile she comin with me if she with it then she text me
And I bet ya she won't diss me when I'm hopin out that Bentley
She see me and then she kiss me made my old bitches miss me
Now, Trina that's a bad one (Uh) I'll take 'em gold or platinum (Yep)
I used to pick up Nicki when I had the Silver Magnum
I ain't lyin I ain't stuntin (Nah) I do it like it's nothin (Uh)
The media they used to say that me and Kim was humpin
I'm a G, I'm a rider, a thug wearin Prada
You niggas think I'm playin till I pop up with Rihanna
If she cute I'm a find her, she giggle then I got her
I used to want Mya now I'm on Zori Sedona

[Chorus]
Trina, Kim Or Nicki, Trina, Kim Or Nicki, Trina, Kim Or Nicki
Which one is comin with me?
Trina, Kim Or Nicki, Trina, Kim Or Nicki, Trina, Kim Or Nicki
Which one is comin with me?
