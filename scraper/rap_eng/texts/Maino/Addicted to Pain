[Chorus: Dios Moreno]
Life give you lessons and I give you blessings
Testing, hope I can answer these questions
I still see my daddy in mama's eyes
That type of hurt leave you traumatized
That pain from the same place the power lies
I'm addicted to pain, yeah
I think I'm addicted to pain, yeah
I still see my daddy in mama's eyes
That type of hurt leave you traumatized
Something 'bout watching the bottom rise
That pain from the same place the power lies
I'm addicted to pain

[Verse 1: Dios Moreno]
Make you stronger if it does not kill you
Pain is the only thing that looks familiar
I look in the mirror and talk to God
I try to hear what he talkin' 'bout
I see no fear as a talk of doubt
Whispers in my ear like it's over now
I'm addicted to pain, I revisit his house
Even if only I'm in then I'm out
I feel I got no more friends, I'm alone
All I got now is my kids and my gold, and I'm fine with that
You can have money, no time 'cause you can't get a hour back
All the way, that's an hour back
The pain is the same place the power at
Addicted to pain

[Chorus: Dios Moreno]
Life give you lessons and I give you blessings
Testing, hope I can answer these questions
I still see my daddy in mama's eyes
That type of hurt leave you traumatized
That pain from the same place the power lies
I'm addicted to pain, yeah
I think I'm addicted to pain, yeah
I still see my daddy in mama's eyes
That type of hurt leave you traumatized
Something 'bout watching the bottom rise
That pain from the same place the power lies
I'm addicted to pain

[Verse 2: Maino]
They say if it don't make you stronger it kill you
Don't know these faces
Pain is the only thing that I know that looks familiar
All of these scars, lord
My life is a wound that never was healed up
I know they relate to my pain
When you hurtin' so long that the suffering heals you
I sit in the dark, call up to God, but he never pick up to talk
My religion is lost, wake up confused, to the same demons I fought
All of these questions, I need some answers
Feel like my world is just look at him dancers
Ain't been to sleep, I'm afraid of what's after
Runnin' away from disaster, addicted to pain
And I try to hide it
That's why I let artists write words on my body
Baby I'm sorry, ain't been the best father
I know it and no I don't like it
Tears fall down your eyes
That type of shit make me wanna die
Somethin' 'bout watchin' my daughter cry
I'm tryna' find the place power lies

[Chorus: Dios Moreno]
I'm addicted to pain, yeah
I think I'm addicted to pain, yeah
I still see my daddy in mama's eyes
That type of hurt leave you traumatized
Something 'bout watching the bottom rise
The pain from the same place the power lies
I'm addicted to pain
