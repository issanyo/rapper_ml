[Verse 1: Maino]
I woke up like
Yeah I'm a G mo'fucker
Bitches see me and they scream K.O.B mo'fucker
Long way from Smack DVDs mo'fucker
The boy be going hard like M.O.P. mo'fucker
Miss me with that hating or get punished for it
I don't really like these niggas I'm just stuntin' on 'em
Yellow Roley, white diamonds like Eliza
My bitch copped me some Guiseppe she a swiper
Fuck parole, drove a Bentley up to Rykers
Bought a ghost and said I did it for the lifers
My new bitch got a baby by a ballplayer
Screaming at the TV catch the ball player
I see I said, jealousy I said
Got these pussy ass niggas mad at me I said
But I'm a king do it major like T.I. kids
Hold the crown for the 'stuy just like B.I. did

[Hook]
I'm about that paper homey fuck fame
These niggas got to kill me for these gold chains
Went to sleep dreaming 'bout that cocaine
Woke up screaming money over everything
(Money, money, money
Money over everything x3)
Woke up screaming money over everything

[Verse 2]
Woke up like yes real nigga
Staring in the mirror you the best real nigga
Nowadays feeling like it's less real niggas
Look around, I'm what's left real nigga
Money over bullshit, pistol in my Nudie jean
Broke up with my cute chick
She calling me the groupie king
Can't help it though, woke up in my Elvis mode
Diamonds in my auto, my Versace on my latest ho
Finger to the sky, no fucks given
Then I'm balls out like my pants missing
Nigga with an attitude, Ice Cube
Fuck the couple cheap hoes and high-priced shoes
Black flag gang-related, yeah they hate it
Showed up uninvited, left with a bitch that's famous
Been yelling money, fuck fame nigga
Chain swinging like a runaway slave nigga

[Hook]
