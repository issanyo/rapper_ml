[Hook]
Yeah, uh huh
You know what it is
Yeah Carmelo, Yeah Carmelo, Yeah Carmelo, yeah Carmelo
Yeah, uh huh
You know what it is
Yeah Carmelo, yeah Carmelo, yeah Carmelo, yeah Carmelo

[Hook]
Yea uh uh, you know what it is
Homie what it do?
Welcome to the Knicks!
Yeah, last season that was nothin’
Got Melo on the squad, now we stuntin’
Reppin’ my town, when you see me in the Garden Square
Yeah Carmelo, Yeah Carmelo, Yeah Carmelo, Yeah Carmelo
I put it down for the whole street screaming
Yeah Carmelo, Yeah Carmelo, Yeah Carmelo, yeah Carmelo

Yeah, blue jersey, orange stripe
Them floor seats, right next to Spike
It’s only right that we welcome Red Hook
Got New York in the game now them boys shook
The city unified throwing up New york signs
Got that boy Melo standing next to Stoudemire
Let the horns blow, every borrough on fire
The same stadium as Ewing, now who wanna try us?
We keep it rockin’ ain't no black and yellow to it
Just the blue headband like Melo do it
Met a bad chick said she was from Harlem
Told her to bring her friend with her, meet me at the Garden

[Hook]
Yea uh uh, you know what it is
Homie what it do?
Welcome to the Knicks!
Yeah, last season that was nothin’
Got Melo on the squad, now we stuntin’
Reppin’ my town, when you see me in the Garden Square
Yeah Carmelo, Yeah Carmelo, Yeah Carmelo, Yeah Carmelo
I put it down for the whole street screaming
Yeah Carmelo, Yeah Carmelo, Yeah Carmelo, yeah Carmelo
