Dimelo, dimelo

[Verse 1]
Uh
What it do, what it be like
What it is, what it is, what it seem like
Have you ever met a king, have you ever had a fling with the thugs
Let em see what a G like
Have you ever really been with a dope boy
Thug life, seeing it is no toy
Girlfriend got her things and her friend got one
Come through, hating bitches be like, “Oh boy!”
Goddamn I’m in love with a boss bitch
I’m talking kilos in the car bitch
Cheap code baby girl so heartless
Got a hoe, she ain’t no artist, oh yeah
Look me in the eyes and say let’s do it
Fucked on the first night, ran right through it
I ain’t gon’ lie, put my face right to it
Then she said she had to go, had to get back to it

[Hook]
She say she like diamonds, say she like furs
Yayo, yayo
She a pretty little doll but she been around first
Yayo, yayo
She hold a nigga down and didn’t say a word
Yayo, yayo
The Feds come around, see this shit hers
Yayo, yayo
She say she like diamonds, say she like furs
Yayo, yayo
She a pretty little doll but she been around first
Yayo, yayo
She hold a nigga down and didn’t say a word
Yayo, yayo
The Feds come around, see this shit hers
Yayo, yayo

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Met a bad bitch on Instagram, okay
Said her ex-man sells weed
Nigga fans on my Instagram, no way
Shawty got an open drug case
Got me caught up in a whirl, bad girl
Now I’m staring from the back
Pray to God somehow that she ends up in my lap
She a cocaine green, i was raised in the trap
Man this bitch so bad that it feels like it’s a trap
Yayo, yayo
She be like yeah (hey no, hey no)
She be all about dough
In the summertime she still playing in the snow, hey
In an all white coup, Chanel bag and a little deuce deuce
T-Shirt say gimme that lou
She like diamonds, give her that too

[Hook]
She say she like diamonds, say she like furs
Yayo, yayo
She a pretty little doll but she been around first
Yayo, yayo
She hold a nigga down and didn’t say a word
Yayo, yayo
The Feds come around, see this shit hers
Yayo, yayo
