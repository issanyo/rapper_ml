[Intro]
Check out and remember my name, my name
Said you gonna remember my name

[Hook]
If I'm alive or not
Cold or hot
Block & guard my spot
Said you gonna remember my name
From the start 'til the end
Whether I lose or win
Family for a friend
You gonna remember my name
My name, my name yeah
Said you gonna remember my name
My name

Listen
I promise to be nothin' short of a G
Never beg for mercy, never seein' me flee
Got blood on my knife, got cash in my jeans
Did dirt in my life, havin nightmares in my dreams
I remember my father, I was watchin him suffer
Help me heavenly father don't let my life get rougher
And you gotta forgive me, I got alcohol in me
Even after I'm dead, niggas gon' never forgive me
I got homies I love that I lost in the game
In my mind they sayin "make 'em remember your name"
If they love you it's cool, give 'em a reason to hate you
I ain't chasin the fame
Said you gonna remember my name

[Hook]

Listen
Imagine a casket, imagine me in it
Now take your time and try to picture this kind of vision
My funeral, my homies dead, my momma cryin
My son is hurt, his daddy gone, now say goodbye
I'm just a memory, baby do you remember me?
Gave y'all all a good reason just to remember see
Now I'm reaching heavenly, I'ma leave a legacy
My niggas gonna swear on my name and pour out Hennessey
They gon' say I did it all, started out with mixin' crack
Look at that before he went to jail he ain't even rap
Came home in the street back up at the block again
Out of nowhere a street nigga killed the rap game

[Hook]

Left a mark in the hood, made a mark in the world
Went straight from the hood, to the top of the world
You can tell that I'm different; you can see that I lived it
When I'm gone you gon' remember me clearly and vivid
The face of a angel, the heart of a lion
Champion spirit, blessed with the will of surviving
You remember the face, you remember the game
When it's said and done
Said you gonna remember my name

[Hook]

[Outro]
I had big dreams of being a rapper
But the reality was I was being sucked back into the streets
And before I knew it, I was back in the hood
