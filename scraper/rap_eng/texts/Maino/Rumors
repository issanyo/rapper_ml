[Intro] (Talking)
Ha ha, check it out right
Niggas be talkin and shit
I've been hearin a lot of shit nigga, you know what I'm sayin?
This nigga said somethin about this nigga
This bitch said somethin about that bitch
Tell'em what you heard, I'm just takin it all in
I'm just sayin what I heard nigga

[Verse]
Listen, I heard "Suge smacked Game"
I ain't say I seen Suge smack Game
I said my man told me "Suge smacked Game, down in Miami"
I just came back from down in Miami
I don't like no fake niggas standin around me
Buck said "Cam'ron fucked around and got robbed in Cali"
But I heard it wasn't true, I ain't gonna spread that on dude
But the news said "Freekey Zeekey snitched on you!"
They say "Puffy is the reason why Shyne in the box"
If I was him I'd come home and put Puffy in a box!
Heard "DMX puff a lot"
They say "when the boy roll up his blunts he like to stuff in the rocks"
Don't ask me, I don't know if it's wrong or right love:
Heard "Foxy got her ass whooped in a night club"
Don't blame me, nigga! I ain't make this stuff up!
If half of it is true, then I guess that's fucked up!

[Hook 2X]
He said she said
Nigga I heard the same shit you heard cause Rumors spread
These industry niggas is worse than bitches
They all run they mouths, some get vicious

[Verse]
Listen, I can't belive niggas fightin over bitches anyway
I heard Carmelo stole my man's shit with Jay
The industry sayin "Ma$e leavin the game"
My bitch from Jersey told me that Jaheim was gay
He ain't the only one that don't like pussy
I was in jail when I heard Trina do like pussy
Heard "Gloria Malez like to sling her pussy"
Got on a DVD and said "Buddens ate her pussy" (Damn!)
Niggas talk but they don't really live
Got this Guerilla nigga tryin to sound like Big
The other day a nigga came through the hood with juice kid
Showed me two chains that belong to Woo-Kid
Let me tell you what I heard through the grapevine
The streets is sayin that Brooklyn is all mine
I heard these niggas is scared of me:
They said the industry ain't pepared for me!

[Chrous 2X]

[Verse]
Listen, I was readin the daily news
When they said "they had flicks with Lloyd Banks havin sex with a hairy dude"
In the hood they say "Hell Rell is a scary dude":
He from Marcy but he don't even come through
I heard "Kelis' head game is the bomb:
She was Pharrell's bitch before she got with Nas"
Some rappers don't play with they broads
Cause I heard "Mack 10 ain't got a problem beatin on T-Boz"
Look y'all it's what I heard I don't know if it's all fact
I'm just tryin to bring New York back
This is New York rap, now who want that?
"The whole industry's fake": I know you heard that!

[Hook 2X]

[Outro] (Talking)
Ha ha, all these niggas is pussies anyway
Talkin and runnin they mouths and all that
Yeah!
