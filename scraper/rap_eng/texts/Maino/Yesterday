Watch my mind grow legs and wander
What did I expect to find out here?
I am only halfway here tonight
Say that You can take this off of my mind
Every time I go back I realize
That yesterday is never as good as it seems
I'm lost in the feelings that I thought were gone
Come in and make all of their light fade out - it fades out
Make their light fade out
