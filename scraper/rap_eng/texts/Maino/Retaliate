Yea yea yea yea yea
Nigga you guna die I swear to god man I promise
Send you up to god motherf*cka I'm a punish you
You betta believe this the day dat I'm a come for you
See me on that screen and you thought that I got comfortable
Hear me on that box and you thought that I was slippin now
See me in the tent and you thought that I was different now
But I ain't never change but I'll catch you on my aim
When we finally run into each other nigga we gun bang
Homie you guna get it can't forget the shit you did
You don't deserve the breathin don't deserve to live
I f*cked up I f*cked up I should've been kilt you
Should've been hammered up should've been nailed you
It is what it is you know just wat I'm talkin bout
Gangsta ass nigga kno exactly who I'm talkin bout
Let the trigger fly sing your spirit to the sky
I pray that you get murdered everyday I fantasize
We guna throw a party when you really finally die
We glad that you gone we guna laugh wen u fry
We piss on your name we guna shit where you lay
We celebrate your death pop bottles at your grave
You better stay armed up I'm a get you blowned up
I'm a get you shot down shot gun miles bust
Duck down I'm up now I can't wait to trill you
Your day is guna come I won't rest until I kill you
Dear father god please forgive me for my sins
My heart full of hatridge and I'm plottin on revenge
My pistol fully loadedd lord help me give me strength
If I see him I'm guna kill him cause my heart now hatin
I wish death on my enemies
Listen yea
I want you so bad that right now I can taste you
Caught in my emotions I'm positive I hate you
Prayin on that day that I can send you to da angels
Hop out and let that chrome desert eagle face you
I see you in my dreams havin visions that I slayed you
Whole clip empty I'm still tryin to spray you
God please forgive me but this retaliation
I'm tired of playing cool my niggas tired of waiting
We guna get together like we savages in caves man
We guna hunt you down bury you inside the basement
Look at wat you made me I'm pissed off and angry
I'm f*cked up and twisted music can't change me
It's guna bring me joy just to see you on your deathbed
Bullets in your torso a hole in your forehead
I ain't guna hesitate to run up give you more lead
Come where you live inkill you on your doorstep
Put you in a cascade put u in a sleeping bag
Put that on my dead homies I'm a murder u n laugh
Look me in da eyes I'm a ride like I'm suppose to do
Promise I'm jus waiting on the time to get close to you
Fuk rap it's a fact nigga this ain't liquor talkin
Fuk that I'm a clap cause I'm sick of talkin
I'm comin I can't wait to drill you
Your days now numbered won't rest until I kill you
Dear father god please forgive me for my sins
My heart full of hatridge and I'm plottin on revenge
My pistol fully loadedd lord help me give me strength
If I see him I'm guna kill him cause my heart now hatin
I wish death on my enemies
