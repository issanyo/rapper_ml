[Intro - French Montana]
Number One Draft Pick
French, Maino
Eighty, what up?
Coke Boy!

[Hook - French Montana]
Told you don't play with my dough
When we run down on you and it's no where to go
Now give em the rope, now give me your chain
Now give me your watch, now give me your rings (Montana!)
Coke's damn near 40 and niggas rapping damn near 40, god damn!

[Verse 1 - French Montana]
I'm from the bottom
Where the niggas say and tell you every thing about him
Niggas owe and they wanna see me fold
But you know cocaine over one million sold
Bootleg, Soundscan, barcode
Hi hater, my guns from Al-Queda
Duck for cover, dickhead
Or get breast-fed, suck ya mudda
I catch him alone, red dot on his nose
I pack four heaters like the top of the stove
Montana, first draft, bandana for a mask
Book a nigga and send god the first half

[Hook - French Montana]
Told you dont play with my dough
When we run down on you and it's no where to go
Now give em the rope, now give me your chain
Now give me your watch, now give me your rings (Montana!)
Coke's damn near 40 and niggas rapping damn near 40, god damn!

[Verse 2 - Maino]
My man
Yeah, wassup french, these fake niggas like flies
Hustle hard
You know what I'm about, yeah you know what I'm about nigga
Yeah i move..come on man

You can tell exactly how I'm moving how i do it, i don't give a fuck
Look at me and look at them you can see i'm different yup
Ask the street about me, them niggas say i'm real as fuck
Two time felon, still dealing, i don't get enough
I ain't with this rap shit, I be on my g son
Real niggas outnumbered, 99 to damn one
More people to kill, so I done bought a bigger gun
From two blocks down, I can hit a nigga's lung
Y'all don't really want play, we can do this all day
Homie it's nothing, cause to me you niggas all gay
I don't have no rap friends, my niggas in that max pen
In that big yard, mess hall, all packed in
Hustle hard baby, grind up and get busy
Turned crack money into cocaine city
These rap niggas they don't want it with me
Ask Red, he don't want it with me

[Hook - French Montana]
Told you dont play with my dough
When we run down on you and it's no where to go
Now give em the rope, now give me your chain
Now give me your watch, now give me your rings (Montana!)
Coke's damn near 40 and niggas rapping damn near 40, god damn!

[Verse 3 - Max B]
Coke wave
Got you Frenchy baby
It's your boy Boss Don
I gotta say my shit too
Maccaroni with the cheese, Gain Greene

Fiends sayin that we got good coke
We the only niggas that got good coke
How many you want, how many you need
Man we bail out, motherfuck police
Nigga we the streets
So many styles I could loot from
Six million ways to die you can choose one
But I'ma give you the option of three
Don't nobody else pop like me
Get a bitch in the back of the car and lay pipe like me
Maxi, call me a taxi
Relax baby
[?], got an automatic, too much running makes you a rabbit, jagged, [?]
Better you motherfuck like a dentist
And i riddle anything that could knock a day off my sentence
I gave you niggas the faith to go above and beyond
They loving the songs we on
Won't Go Far, Straight Cash, Hole In A Nigga
They got a hole on it, Bigga
Acting like i was supposed to fall off, but the timing was right
He's having the time of his life
Spending all his money on jewelry and vehicles
Turned so vivid
It should seem clear to you
Dare you to fuck with the boss don biggavel, bitch nigga please
These byrd bitches history, oww!

Count that shit
We gettin' money
How the fuck you think i pay them lawyers that about to drag Your ass to the court
Nigga we here to stay
