I'm riding through the city with my top back, top back
I got my thing ready, cut back
Life's a gamble, I gotta bet, stop that
Well it's your time you can't turn the clock back, I need a way out
I just need a way out, I just need a way out
Life's a gamble, I gotta bet, stop that
Well it's your time you can't turn the clock back, I need a way out
I just need a way out, I just need a way out

On my knees praying for a better way
Waiting on a miracle we need a change
Alcoholic sleep I got stomach pains
I'm hungry and my father ain't been home in days
When it's quiet, I can hear my mama crying
In the sound of her voice that she tired of trying
No [?] food stamps and a [?] stool
The same thing for breakfast is for dinner too
No hope like I'm doing [?] I get a chance
14 and they forcing me to be a man
What I'm supposed to do, tell me what my options is
To turn to the streets, I never wanted this
Drop school, playing crimes turn to robberies
Cocaine turn to crack next turn to g's
I'm on a block killing with 100 packs
Feels like I'm trapped, I need a way out

I'm riding through the city with my top back, top back
I got my thing ready, cut back
Life's a gamble, I gotta bet, stop that
Well it's your time you can't turn the clock back, I need a way out
I just need a way out, I just need a way out
Life's a gamble, I gotta bet, stop that
Well it's your time you can't turn the clock back, I need a way out
I just need a way out, I just need a way out

So now I'm in the cell in my state greens
Fast life, caught up to me viciously
Trying to stand strong but I wanna scream
Cause all I got is letters in my memories
[?] 15 years in the hole, I'm only just 17 years old
I try to close my eyes I see nightmares
Hearing grown men yelling on the top tier
Feeling like my whole life wasted
My life can't grow behind these cages
Trying to keep hope but I'm loosing it
How the fuck am I supposed to live with [?] tuna fish
Tell me how long can a man ignore
God let them have mercy when I see the board
Cause this is time that I'm never getting back
I want another chance, I need a way out

I'm riding through the city with my top back, top back
I got my thing ready, cut back
Life's a gamble, I gotta bet, stop that
Well it's your time you can't turn the clock back, I need a way out
I just need a way out, I just need a way out
Life's a gamble, I gotta bet, stop that
Well it's your time you can't turn the clock back, I need a way out
I just need a way out, I just need a way out

I'm laying in the bed and my brush sweet
Staring at the ceiling I can't sleep
2 different women laying next to me
Thinking, is this what it's supposed to be?
Looking in the mirror, I'm a rapper now
Wow, what was supposed to happen now
I thought success brought happiness
So tell me why the fuck I ain't happy yet
Got a lot of [?] I turn my life around
I came up but I think my soul is down
I made them bless to receive the love
But I think I lost track of what my mission was
Too busy in the club popping champagne
Almost I forgot about my mama's pain
Knowing that I'm blessed, thank God for that
But I still feel trapped, I need a way out

I'm riding through the city with my top back, top back
I got my thing ready, cut back
Life's a gamble, I gotta bet, stop that
Well it's your time you can't turn the clock back, I need a way out
I just need a way out, I just need a way out
Life's a gamble, I gotta bet, stop that
Well it's your time you can't turn the clock back, I need a way out
I just need a way out, I just need a way out
