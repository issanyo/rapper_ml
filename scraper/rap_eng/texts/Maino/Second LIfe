[Verse 1: Maino]
You used to tell me I could be whatever I believed
What would I do? I would like to see your wildest dreams
I brought guns and them drugs to your house
But you refuse and give up on me, say you never shut me out
Forgive me ma, brought the fuzz to your house
Got you locked under reason while the housing kicked you out
I'm sorry mama, though you was tryin', mama
My pops died, the streets had become my father, mama
You say you failed me, that's not true, I failed you
And all that pain I caused you, ma just let me help you
At the hospital, the doctor say you might not make it
Aneurysm in the brain, man I could not take it
But like a miracle, somehow you came up out it
5 weeks in a coma, walked up out it
You still alive, so no reason for the tears
We gon' celebrate now, mama love you still here

[Hook: Dios Moreno]
I look in the mirror, I don't see no fear
I walk through the valley, and them demons appear
Who said you only live once?
I feel I'm immortal, I feel I'm immortal
Who said you only live once?
I feel I'm immortal, I feel I'm immortal
Who said you only live once?

[Verse 2: Maino]
We was young and dumb, but we thought we had the answers
Questioning hunger, thought that selling crack would be the answer
Thinking the life we live would only bring us gold and riches
Dreamin' of millions, cuttin' grams on your mother's dishes
But we was blind, couldn't see what we was headed for
Catchin' cases back and forth, off to jail I go
You held me down, all the money in the letters
You sent me pictures of you sittin' on a Lexus
My nigga made it, I was screamin' from the top tier
It's gon' be on, you would tell me when I got there
But life is life, shit is crazy when it happens
That nigga boo took a stand and started yappin'
So now they got you in the same place I came from
Roads changed, so for you I'd do the same, son
Brothers for life, never change to the death
When you home, we gon' celebrate it like you never left

[Hook: Dios Moreno]
I look in the mirror, I don't see no fear
I walk through the valley, and them demons appear
Who said you only live once?
I feel I'm immortal, I feel I'm immortal
Who said you only live once?
I feel I'm immortal, I feel I'm immortal
Who said you only live once?

[Verse 3: Maino]
When I came into the game, I smelled like gunsmoke
They had never seen a street nigga this close
One look into my eyes, they knew that I had lived it
When they met me, they could tell right there that I was different
They knew the pain that I was speakin' had to be from demons
Really seein' niggas curled up like a fetus pleadin'
Man them corners light L, but we call it life
17 on trial, facin' quarter life
So many nights, could've died but I missed Christ
Who said you only live once? I'm on my fifth life
Put your foot inside my shoes and see how far you get
We gon' celebrate now, I got more to live

[Hook: Dios Moreno]
I look in the mirror, I don't see no fear
I walk through the valley, and them demons appear
Who said you only live once?
I feel I'm immortal, I feel I'm immortal
Who said you only live once?
I feel I'm immortal, I feel I'm immortal
Who said you only live once?
