[Chorus]
Shout out to the groupies and the ho niggas
And all the dick riders in the world with us
Can't forget about the fuck boys
I made a song for the fuck boys
Lame niggas on the way out
Lame niggas on the way out
Can't forget about the fuck boys
I made a song for the fuck boys

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey nigga what you talkin' 'bout?
We know you ain't livin' what you talkin' 'bout
We see you frontin' for the 'Gram again
We see you frontin' for the 'Gram again
I wrote a song for the fuck niggas
The grown men, groupies in the club with us
Y'all gotta stop with all the dick riding
Y'all gotta stop with all the dick riding, hey
I'm allergic to these suckers homie
Fell asleep, woke up with these suckers on me
These niggas frontin' for these hoes boy
Run into a real one and get exposed boy
The fake shit should be a felony
These haters movin' over jealousy
These pussy niggas goin' out of style
Big shoutout to these fuckin' clowns

[Chorus]
Shout out to the groupies and the ho niggas
And all the dick riders in the world with us
Can't forget about the fuck boys
I made a song for the fuck boys
Lame niggas on the way out
Lame niggas on the way out
Can't forget about the fuck boys
I made a song for the fuck boys

[Verse 2]
Shout out to the pump fakin' fraud niggas
What the strippers and the bartenders tell you
You ain't spendin' money, stay up out the strip club
You ain't spendin' money, stay up out the strip club
Said he got the bag but he goofy though
He just puttin' on an act, this a movie roll
Them real diamonds on your neck, yeah we heard about 'em
You got shooters on deck, yeah we heard about 'em
Lying ass niggas run the world now
These fuck boys in competition with the girls now
And I thought you was a trapper, huh?
You so pressed to take a picture with a rapper, huh?
Troll niggas in my DM's, troll niggas in my DM's
And I bet you he a fuck boy, time's up, it's over for you fuck boys

[Chorus]
Shout out to the groupies and the ho niggas
And all the dick riders in the world with us
Can't forget about the fuck boys
I made a song for the fuck boys
Lame niggas on the way out
Lame niggas on the way out
Can't forget about the fuck boys
I made a song for the fuck boys
