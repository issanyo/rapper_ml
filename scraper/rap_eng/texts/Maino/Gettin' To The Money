[Verse 1]
Not average, not an actress
Walk up in the room, she the baddest
All she wanna know is where the cash is
Only fuck with niggas with status
Ball player, go player
High-heel Valentino, no air
Hop out, fat ass, long hair
Bum bitches on the side, no fair
Boss bitch, boss bitch
You now in the presence of a dope bitch
For that money she gonna do a pole trick
Get it how she get it cause she a pro bitch
Mat a bad bitch she a swiper
She the shit no diaper
Got me some Giuseppes I like her
Everything she touch is fire
She be gettin’ to the money
Got a smile like it ain’t nothing funny
Niggas in the spot no honey
Bartending with a big bowl of stolen hundreds
She all about the benjis
Always talking ‘bout Fendi
In VIP where her friends be
Don’t ride nothing less than a Benz seat

[Verse 2]
Shorty she murdered the scene
She bodied Giuseppe Saline
And all in between
And they say her fur is obscene
That PETA might give her a ring
And I say she doing her thing
And I say she built for a king
I let her in that seat cause she royalty
Her pussy so good, I give up half of my royalties
Lassie, not for nothing, girl that’s all I need
I promise that I give you all of me
Only a boss bitch affording me
Money keep calling me
Help try to build me an empire
Need a boss bitch to cook
They want a real nigga to expire
Try to leave me like tookie
My baby get to the money
Cause she got goals
She done got it on the road
Shit, she done got it on the pole
Then she get to that money
She don’t fuck with you bustas
She only fuck with the muscles
She prolly find you some customs
