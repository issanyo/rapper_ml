[Chorus: Bre-Z]
I could keep it one hundred but y'all don't feel me though
I tried to be a man, but these streets turned me to a nigga though
And these streets is all I know
This Hennessy and weed is all I know
But tell me how can I come back from it?
Or tell me how do I react to it?
Hey God what is it you asked from me?
This ain't what I wanted
Oh no, this ain't what I wanted still
I tried to give you what you wanted
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Maino]
Uh, look, will I die before I see forever?
I wanna fly, do I need propellers?
I tried but I thought bein' a G was better
They say I'm like Pac in the streets for niggas
Now who would think that I receive a sentence?
Ran out my mama's house and became a legend
Battle scars, jail bars seem scary
Prayin' to a black god, do you hear me?
Shots flyin', niggas duckin', shawty hit though
It's my fault, I'm the one that she was with yo
Past hauntin' me, the devil keep tauntin' me
Sorry mama, know that this ain't what you wanted from me
I know you hurtin' when they blame me
Wish they'd have told me this would flame me
So now I draw my pain in them painkillers
Damn, guess this what the game get you

[Chorus: Bre-Z]
I could keep it one hundred but y'all don't feel me though
I tried to be a man, but these streets turned me to a nigga though
And these streets is all I know
This Hennessy and weed is all I know
But tell me how can I come back from it?
Or tell me how do I react to it?
Hey God what is it you asked from me?
This ain't what I wanted
Oh no, this ain't what I wanted still
I tried to give you what you wanted
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Maino]
Last year I watched my lil homies turn haters
Same ones that I raised, now they got the vapors
Lost friends, gained brothers, let it fall apart
It's all material, Ricky lost my Audemar (still love him)
Love and loyalty, thugs gon' relate to me
'Cause black males in the country feel the same pain
Yeah, back and forth, going through the drama
She hate me, that's a text from my daughter's mama (why?)
Tryna' find peace but all I found was liquor
Fell asleep drunk, woke up with a different stripper
Jesus piece swinging as I battle demons
All I wanted was the money, fame wasn't needed
Had a friend that used to tell me life is what you make it
Said you can't enjoy life unless you fully taste it
Then they found him with some holes in him
I can still hear him screamin' nigga go get 'em

[Chorus: Bre-Z]
I could keep it one hundred but y'all don't feel me though
I tried to be a man, but these streets turned me to a nigga though
And these streets is all I know
This Hennessy and weed is all I know
But tell me how can I come back from it?
Or tell me how do I react to it?
Hey God what is it you asked from me?
This ain't what I wanted
Oh no, this ain't what I wanted still
I tried to give you what you wanted
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Outro]
Niggas tryna eat off my plate
Gotta-gotta-gotta worry every day
Sucker-sucker-sucker ass niggas can relate
Yeah, sucker ass niggas can relate
Niggas tryna eat off my plate
Gotta-gotta-gotta worry every day
Sucker-sucker-sucker ass niggas can relate
Yeah, sucker ass niggas can relate
