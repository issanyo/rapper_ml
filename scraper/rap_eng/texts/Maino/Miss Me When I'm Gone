[Intro: Maino]
Uh, they gon' miss me when I'm gone

[Verse 1: Maino]
Uh, they gon' wait until I'm dead before they celebrate me
Shot inside my head and then appreciate me, yuh
This how this phony world do it nigga, yeah
In life, love is never proven nigga, no
Moma bury me with principles
Don't give these niggas invitations to my funeral
I lost feelings I am so numb
No emotion in my eyes I am frozen
I lost love now my heart cold
I wear my scars like they solid gold
Rock em proudly, they was squirtin' blood
Said I'm comfortable with hate they can keep the love
They gon' wait until I die before they celebrate, no
Don't want these niggas at my fuckin' wake
Tell em keep the Tims, they don't have to mourn
Cause they gon' miss me when I'm, gone

[Chorus: That Girl Georgie & Maino]
Miss me when I'm gone
They gon' miss me when I'm gone
Miss me when I'm gone
They gon' miss me when I'm gone, hey
Miss me when I'm gone
They gon' miss me when I'm gone
You Gon' miss me when I'm gone, yeah

[Verse 2: Maino]
Uh, die a legend or die alone
Rot in prison or find your home
They say my music more painful
Nah, I just spit the truth from every angle
Lord, I've been scald with hot water
Guilty, in the presence of my daughter
Help me, I've been sinnin' a lot longer
Wealthy, from the blessings the block brought us
I want my flowers while I'm here to smell em
Chicks die before we had the chance to know we felt them
Show em valence they gon' show respect
They hate you now but praise you after death
They gon' wait until I die before they say I'm great
No, don't want these niggas at my fuckin' wake
Tell em keep the Tims they don't have to mourn
Cause they gon' miss me when I'm, gone

[Chorus: That Girl Georgie & Maino]
Miss me when I'm gone
They gon' miss me when I'm gone
Miss me when I'm gone
They gon' miss me when I'm gone, hey
Miss me when I'm gone
They gon' miss me when I'm gone
You Gon' miss me when I'm gone, yeah

[Outro: Maino & That Girl Georgie]
Die a legend or die alone
They say my music more painful
Miss me when I'm gone
They gon' miss me when I'm gone
Miss me when I'm gone
They gon' miss me when I'm gone
Miss me when I'm gone
They gon' miss me when I'm gone
Miss me when I'm gone
They gon' miss me when I'm gone
Miss me when I'm gone

So I'm tryna, I try to find a medium in music
My music gotta fit somewhere, in there
You know what I mean?
The music gotta fit, we can't be, we can't be preaching in there
We, we gotta get a game, we gotta get the truth
You gotta get the truth, they gotta get the truth man
Straight up, straight up...
