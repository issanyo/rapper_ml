[Intro]
I don’t care what y’all think
I don’t care if you think you a lawyer
If you a man, if you an African-American
If you whatever the fuck you think you are
Put down for the niggas to these motherfuckers
You know, and until we own some shit
I’mma call it like it is
How you gonna be a man if you starving?

[Verse 1: Maino]
I’mma die a legend, words from a reverend
Already drunk now on my way to heaven
Heaven don’t want me and I ran out of blessings
And I’m coming out of hell with a three fifty seven
Higher than a bitch, flyer than a six
Diamonds in the rollie worth dying for the risk
Hanging out the window when I’m firing a fifth
Got a bullet for them niggas so they lying in a ditch
It ain’t about lyrics, real niggas feel it
Voices in my head screaming telling me to get it
Living on the edge is the only way to live it
So my homies in the pen I’mma pull up when I visit
The realest on the globe, got me in the zone
Pop champagne yelling money over hoes
Somebody gonna die when I run into my foes
Feeling like [?] yeah, I did it for my woes
Pull up in a Benz leave in a 'Rari
Came in peace, left with a body
Pissy ass drunk with a sawed off shotty
The feds on me is the ones that got Gotti
I ain’t no rap nigga, yeah, I’m just that nigga
I’m the OG of the DOD rap killers
Little ass monkeys wanna act gorillas
Pull up in them furs, broad day and just sack niggas

[Hook: Dios Moreno & Maino]
Living in hell, I gotta find heaven
Living like a gangsta, so I’mma die a legend
Said I’m living in hell, tryna find heaven
Living like a gangsta, so I’mma die a legend
I’mma die a legend, I’mma die a legend
I’mma die a legend, I’mma die a legend
I’mma die a legend, I’mma die a legend
I’mma die a legend, I’mma die a legend

[Verse 2: Maino]
I’mma die a legend
On the front page news at eleven
Traded my religion for these pretty ass bitches
So I’m headed to the strip club ready for the tipping
I’m about business, fuck y’all feelings
Thought I seen Christ when I touched that mirror
Niggas gonna remember, they don’t live forever
Like 50 Cent two nines in the Jetta
Oh dope boy sweat suit in the room
Leaning on the Beemer like I’m [?]
When it come to G shit I’m the CEO
I gave real niggas something more to hold
Real street nigga that turned into a rap star
In an industry full of fuckboys and actors
In a Rolls Royce but I whip it like NASCAR
Heaven for a G? I’m a make sure to ask y’all

[Hook: Dios Moreno & Maino]
Living in hell,  I gotta find heaven
Living like a gangsta, so I’mma die a legend
Living in hell, tryna find heaven
Living like a gangsta, so I’mma die a legend
I’mma die a legend, I’mma die a legend
I’mma die a legend, I’mma die a legend
I’mma die a legend, I’mma die a legend
I’mma die a legend, I’mma die a legend

[Outro: Dios Moreno & Maino]
I’mma die a legend
I’mma die a legend
I’mma die a legend
