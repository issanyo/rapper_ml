Ya momma forgive me
I know you needed and wanted a better me
But I fell asleep not knowin' friends was enemies
Had to cut some guys off, I was smellin' the jealousy
No more love, ain't no reason or even pretend to be
It's like my day one niggas end up in a steel cage
All these lame niggas livin' I'm dyin' my will's made
Tryna take my mind off the fact that we still slaves
Shorty's bad and she fucked like she needed her bill paid
Hey! When you tryna go legit but ya friends dealers
Took enough to buy a brick to the Benz dealer
Facin' traff for ya woes, it don't get realer
Ya baby mommas need ta go but you can't kill her
Suffer hard we gon' get it either way
Whip that bitch! You get it? Beats by Dre
Fuck tryna please niggas  let em fall away
But I'm "all the way up!" Like I'm still awake
Pops died early, I had to grind early
Big guns way before I had sides on me
Talkin' ol' beef take it back to God Tony
Before actresses laid they eyes on me
Yeah, let's talk money and drugs
The OGs said "you can't trade money for love"
All brothers, gang bang but none of us blood
Rest in peace to these ho niggas, none of them us
Couldn't help being different than them, I shitted on them
Niggas know I did it to win, admit it. I'm him!
