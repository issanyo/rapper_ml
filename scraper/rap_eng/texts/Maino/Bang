[Hook]
We still up in these streets
(All of my niggas gon' bang, all of my niggas gon bang)
We ain't keepin' the peace
(All of my niggas gon' bang, all of my niggas gon bang)
We still up in these streets
(All of my niggas gon' bang, all of my niggas gon bang)
And they movin' them keys
(All of my niggas gon' bang, all of my niggas gon bang)

[Verse 1]
All of my niggas about all they dough
All of my niggas gon' hustle the blow
All of my niggas gon' ride for they niggas
Thank God for my niggas, won't die for no ho
Where's all that money that they rap about?
Where's all them fires that they talk about?
Where's all that jewelry? Can I see the Uzi?
They wantin that we really about
I can't believe that these niggas was dealers
I can't believe that these niggas was killers
I can't believe em, these niggas not heathens
They never was beefin', they never was sinners
Ride for my homies, I ride for my homies
Straight to the top with the rest of my homies
Don't wanna live if I'm not with my homies
Fuck all that rap shit, these bitches don't know me
Pray for me baby, I'm bout to go off
Most of these niggas ain't nothing at all
Press on a button, my roof will come off
Never was for me, these niggas is soft

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Some of my niggas is still in the street
One of my niggas be home in a week
Love all my niggas, I love all my niggas
It's true and I know who to call when it's beef
Real niggas say I'm the king of the stars
Who said I'm not and I'll prove he a liar
Niggas don't want it, they only is honest
I'm just being honest, I'm really that guy
Really that nigga? That thing is a fail
They not gon' stop me from blowin' this year
I've just been plottin' and patiently waitin'
And waitin' and plottin' the shit on em yeah
All of my niggas that love me the same
All of my niggas that pop with a bang
All of my niggas, want more of my niggas
That's 500 niggas that ride for ya mane
That ain't gon stop what was destined to be
Hunned of runners through Queens with a key
Niggas can't touch me, they really can't see?
Hollering Brooklyn it's Maino and Reef

[Hook]
