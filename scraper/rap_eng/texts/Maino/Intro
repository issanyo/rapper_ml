Welcome to the mob you have now been invited
To step inside my world where lames get indicted
Killers get excited the drama gets sub united
The bloodshed and warm in my niggers get united
Welcome to the mob got models in my arms
Shooters in the trunk cold blood in my palm
Look and see the stars tonight we are gods
Screaming fuck the world but I shall never cross my dogs
I am my brother's keeper until I meet the reaper
The mafia your arms ain't long enough to reach us
Cannel affiliated my goons demonstrated
Finally got a reason for the dogs to celebrate it
Free lease by that cold old murta
Lot of niggas talk killing name but no murder
Get the blood that starts spilling
Trick a finger coat and
Game size get old and my titty whole warlock
Word I'm a young rapper browser
With expensive trousers
Out of public housing run for couple hundred thousand
What you have here as fear attitude this coffer
'Cause I could cash out two fifty in the bag year
Have wrong royal nets of the game at the bar claire
Court side seats offer blood sweat and hard game
Do what the mob said for you be a target
Catch you sleeping at war bounce and leave you more bam
Fuck these niggers talking all that money chider cheddar
Mafioso in this bitch
Fuck niggers Peter Paning
Brooklyn to the duffle fire on the side of me
A splitter skinny nigga that's a fucking phlebotomy
Paging doctor Martyr or whatever that you calling me
I ball with your whole giver a facial say that's all in me
Kobe niggers say they know me
Frontin' like they running whipping niggers really owe me
I'm getting on this model pussy out here like I'm cut low
You nigga still beating through the phone like Naomi Campbell
Rob shit mob shit fuckin' with the mob bitch
You cross dressing bitch niggers grandma mars shit
It's Lucky Don one of the mafia niggers
Say my name and watch me pop me a nigga
I salute my lakers ock me a nigga
Blow your whole shit down shorty in my face hoe sit down
I'm on my grind look what focus found
We sat down and had a talk on it
Promise my niggers every track I'm leaving chalk on it
Real shit I don't think hard just talk on it
Paranoia really bust it got my own lawyer
Get some clothes I got something nice and chrome for ya
Two twins named Shaqoya and Toya
Lucky Don I make them both bust off at the same damn time
The mafia we the same damn kind
Yeah hussle hard mouse better
Yeah all the bitches heard me
Feds tryin' to in dice enemies wanna me murder me
A hundred thou' in a duffle bag just for emergency
Still got that thing I'm on bell committing purgery
Boy I'm on T never turn shit down
A hundred bottles so many sparkles might burn shit down
Cope cowboy a hundred bricks make you drown in a drought
My nigga swimming better find you in town
Homie I'm all in flossing panorama porsching
Bossing these niggers is dead without the coffin
We ain't never gonna let up homie who gon check us
The mafia by blood or by love they gon' respect us
