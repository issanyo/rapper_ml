[Verse 1]
Yeah, how you feel knowin' how I feel?
We s'posed to roll like the iron wheel
'Til the death of us, we said it was forever us
Now you see me and ignore me like we never was
You changed on me, how the fuck you change on me?
You walked out, felt like it rained on me
I woke up, felt like hatin' you this morning
Cause I'm mad and I'm jealous, fuck it, this is how I'm mourning
How the hell I'm s'posed to be happy watching you be happy?
Indirect on Instagram, think you gettin' at me
Knew I was a mess, I needed time to make you happy
All that fighting and cheating but you the one that had me
I'll put a bullet in your nigga
How the fuck you gon' leave me to these hoes and these strippers?
I mean, what happened to another try?
Look how you got me, sometimes I wish you'd die

[Hook]
You a murderer, committin' homicides
Never tell the truth, I guess you realized
I guess you realized, I guess you realized
Call the coroner, am I still alive?

[Verse 2]
You're killin' me, look at what you did to me
Your new nigga ain't as real as me
I'll admit it, I got issues
I'm here screamin, "Fuck you" but I miss you
Is it me or the liquor talkin'?
Tryna fight the urge from keep callin'
You drained blood right up out my veins
Now how fuckin' bad I wanna cause you pain?
You must have had me on your death list
Pray to God that you see me with my next bitch
But look at what I'm left with
By myself wishin' that you never had existed
I'm wrong and I know it's bad
I keep thinkin' Louboutin and Chanel bags
What happened to another try?
You still livin' but somehow I must've died

[Hook]
You a murderer, committin' homicides
Never tell the truth, I guess you realized
I guess you realized, I guess you realized
Call the coroner, am I still alive?
You a murderer, committin' homicides
Never tell the truth, I guess you realized
I guess you realized, I guess you realized
Call the coroner, am I still alive?
