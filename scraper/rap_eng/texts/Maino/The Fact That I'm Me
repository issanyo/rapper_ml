[Intro]
You don't know the pain I feel when I see you smiling
And when I roll up you start wilding
So I fuck like everything's honky dory
But it's a whole different story

[Hook x4]
You don't like the fact that I'm me
Don't like the fact that I'm me

[Verse 1]
You don't like the fact that I'm never caught up in acting
Stripped out of jail but landed inside an Austin
Hopped off the whale hoes' heads turning like ? spins
Black flag mob my dogs ready for action
Yeah, these niggas never deny that
Run up four miles but he never without that
When you hear me screaming I live it, baby, don't doubt that
Bitch gave me head for days, she wanna out that
Bullet proof love for my war lords
Fuck these industry bitches, man, they all whores
Hundred rounds and the drummers, it's what they call for
Tattoo, shirt off, man, I'm boxing
What it be like, nigga? Came to the game just me, my nigga
Hoes on my tip like TI, nigga
Bitch, just the mafia, meet my niggas

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2]
Pull right in that Ghost, some dead niggas
Funeral snap at one ahead, nigga
Got a coffin and a grave for all of you fed niggas
Louis Vuitton bat from leaving them red niggas
Yeah, I ain't watching the speed, somebody saying it
200 pounds in the trunk, this nigga crazy
Boy, threw a Benz in the club, just ask anybody
When you act bad for bad I'll match anybody
Hearts for hearts, mouse do that there
With them all white squares, go and move that there
Where they at? I don't see 'em, heard that they trying to be 'em
Fuck around with my people, leave 'em right where I see 'em
They don't like that, cook it up, crack that
Million dollar ? got a hundred in a nap sack
One in the head if a nigga wanna snatch that
Bang, bang anyone, nigga, we like that

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
You don't like the fact that my niggas floating
Fuck you, bitch ass nigga, no sugar coating
Now who you mad at, me or yourself, you fake?
You like to cheat on your girl, apply pressure, now who's gonna melt?
That boy telling, you can read it yourself
He was busting, he's done, so I don't think he needed the help
Rat nigga, left shit on this shelf
That nigga consumed for dough, the mafia, we all men
My brother's keeper, we all in, good mugging niggas, we all in
Middle finger in the air, waving
I'm trying to be one of the mafia's favorite
The team that I chose and I'm not gonna trade it
Jump shot in your face and I'm not gonna fade it

[Hook x4]
