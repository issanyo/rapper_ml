[Chorus]
I can make you famous
I can make you famous
Let's make a movie, a movie
Shorty get naked, set it up and tape it
Let's make a movie, a movie
You could be my co-star
Girl I'll take you so far
Let's make a movie, a movie
Lights camera action, I'm ready for some action
Let's make a movie, a movie

[Verse 1]
We can play like actors, no you not a amateur
You can have the lead role, and I'll be the director
Setting up the camera, get into your character
Come up out that little dress, and let me climb on top of ya
Now baby let's just get it on, with the camera
You see that red light, that means I've pressed record
Now mami look it's easy, go ahead, come on please me
Now we can put on repeat, and play it back on t.v
Let's make a x-rated, sex tape, show the world your head great
Show the world you good with it, back shots, hair pulling
Time for some action, Kimmy Kardashian
Lil camcorder lets point it at your abdomen

[Chorus]
I can make you famous
I can make you famous
Let's make a movie, a movie
Shorty get naked, set it up and tape it
Let's make a movie, a movie
You could be my co-star
Girl I'll take you so far
Let's make a movie, a movie
Lights camera action, I'm ready for some action
Let's make a movie, a movie

[Verse 2]
Mami let me get with you, wanna share my bed with you
We can have sex in H.D. digital
It ain't really difficult, let me see your nipples boo
Dance for me baby, just move how the strippers do
My private lil prom queen, doing all the wild things
Never seen yourself giving head on the flat screen
Instant celebrity, natural star to me
Sit back and rewind the part when you was riding me
Ran out of blank tapes, need another blank tape
One more scene and we got ourselves a sex tape
Your friends know I'm filming ya, they seen what I did with ya
We can even use a camera phone like Vivaca

[Chorus]
I can make you famous
I can make you famous
Let's make a movie, a movie
Shorty get naked, set it up and tape it
Let's make a movie, a movie
You could be my co-star
Girl I'll take you so far
Let's make a movie, a movie
Lights camera action, I'm ready for some action
Let's make a movie, a movie
You can be a star
You can be a star
When I'm finish with you girl, you gonna be a star
You can be a star
You can be a star
When I'm finish with you girl, you gonna be a star

[Chorus]
I can make you famous
I can make you famous
Let's make a movie, a movie
Shorty get naked, set it up and tape it
Let's make a movie, a movie
You could be my co-star
Girl I'll take you so far
Let's make a movie, a movie
Lights camera action, I'm ready for some action
Let's make a movie, a movie
