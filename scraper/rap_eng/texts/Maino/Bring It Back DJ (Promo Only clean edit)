Bring it back, DJ, bring it back, DJ, uh
Y-yeah, y-yeah, Maino, uh, uh

You already know, move when I come through
You could run with winners or lose if you want to
Mami, here's your chance, just tell me what you gon' do
Doin' what I can now, I'm doin' what I want to

I be on that next ish diamonds in my neckless
Keep about thirty two shots in my tek clip
Holla at my thugs in the club livin' reckless
Yeah, it's lunchtime, eat these lames up for breakfast

Nuvo sipper, I'm a Benz whipper
Shorty playin' hard, actin' funny, I'ma diss her
'Cause I'm a bread getter, LV on the sweater
Droptop Phantom, put that one on Twitter, now

Bring it back, DJ, bring it back, DJ
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, DJ
Let me hear that, hit a-let me-let me hear that, hit again
Let me hear that, hit a-hit-a-let me hear that, hit again

Bring it back, DJ, bring it back, DJ

Let me hear that, hit a-let me-let me hear that, hit again
Let me hear that, hit a-hit-a-let me hear that, hit again

Yeah, let me hear that song again, play it nonstop
Bring it, bring it back, DJ, start it from the top
Like you already, you already, you already know
Move when I come through

You could run with winners or lose if you want to
Mami, here's your chance take a glance let me show you
Everything is real, keep it thorough like I'm 'posed to
I'm a keep it, Brooklyn, Black Flag Maino

Bury me in Brooklyn, I'm a black angel
I be kickin' truth for these other rapper's nonsense
Wings on the Coupe probably flyin' through the projects
I ain't just a artist, I'm here gettin' paper regardless

Bring it back, DJ, bring it back, DJ
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, DJ
Let me hear that, hit a-let me-let me hear that, hit again

Let me hear that, hit a-hit-a-let me hear that, hit again

You can get with this or you can get with that
You can move on or you can bring it back
Look at how we roll, Mami, this is where it's at
But if you got a man he don't do it like that

Baby, I ain't no actor, black bandanna
Can't get rid of me, baby, I'm cancer
Life is a movie, look at all the cameras
People say they heard of me from here to Atlanta

This is how we play, one more time on replay
Standin' in the DJ booth
(Bring it back, bring it back, DJ)
Let me hear that hit again, please play that hit again
Yeah, unstoppable, Maino, got another hit again
