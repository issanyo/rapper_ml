[Intro]
All I got is one life to live
All I got is one life to live
Been stop giving a fuck, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Been stop giving a fuck (yes)
I ain't got another one left (nope)
Niggas gonna hate just 'cause (why?)
Real niggas love me to death (woo)
Think I give a fuck how they feel? (I don't)
Think I give a fuck how they feel? (I don't)
Hop up out a Wraith with a cape on
Bitches like that's how you feel?
Live niggas do what they want (woo)
Lame niggas do what they told to (let's go)
Hundred round drum in the AK
Lay a nigga down like Pro-Tools
Started out hardley with nothin'
Got a brick, thought it was somethin'
Finely got the bitch I wanted
Found out she really was nothin'
I was just tryna be somebody
Couldn't afford to be nobody
Could've been shot dead in that lobby
It was either shoot first or be bodied
Mama screamin' boy be careful
Bullets flyin' past my earlobes
Knowing I can die anywhere yo
Think I care about these industry weirdos?

[Chorus]
Only one life to live
Daughter sayin' where you live?
Ran out of care this morning
So I don't have a fuck to give
I don't have a fuck to give
I don't have a fuck to give
Ran out of care this morning
So I don't have a fuck to give

[Verse 2]
How am I feelin'? no fucks given
Fuck they feelings, who got opinions?
I been the truth since I stepped out of prison
I know the feeling of touchin' a million
I know the feeling of touchin' the clouds
Fuck what they say, it don't bother me now
Playin' with bricks, do you follow me now?
Shorty says she was gon' swallow it down
I got the Glock with the scope and the laser
Back in the yard all I had was my razor
Studied the cocaine like it was my major
Now I get treated like I was their savior
Shout out my dogs who left home and got lost
Woke up this morning, fuck goin' to court
The struggle is long, my life is so short
Somebody shoot me, get killed in a cross
Nowadays niggas wanna be somebody
Everybody act like they somebody
Niggas on the gram stunt like they got it
Hoes gon' fuck for a ride in a Rari
One life to live, two baby mamas to care
What a life to live, ran out of fucks to give

[Chorus]
Only one life to live
Daughter sayin' where you live?
Ran out of care this morning
So I don't have a fuck to give
I don't have a fuck to give
I don't have a fuck to give
Ran out of care this morning
So I don't have a fuck to give
