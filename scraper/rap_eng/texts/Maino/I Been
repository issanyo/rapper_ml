[Intro:]
POB Bitch

[Chorus:]
I should tattoo tears for my niggas gone
I been grinding hard to put my niggas on
I been getting pissy drunk like everyday
I been living fast ain't got  no time to pray
I been spending money in the strip club lately
I been spending more time with my side bitch lately
I ain't tryna sleep i been up for days
I been living fast ain't got no time to pray

[Verse 1:]
Woke up in the morning and i forgot to go pray
If i catch a opposite mistaking when he lay
Why the fuck you hate on me I get paid
Dont stop by my house i get ready
Im turnt up every night my niggas faded
Waiting on that pill my niggas waiting
Sipping lean, smoke dope my niggas fainted
Why the fuck you hating on me nigga i made it
So shawty why you ignoring me
Real niggas pay for loyalty
No i can't snitch i can't [?]
Bitch OT up that's my team

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I been paper chasing I forgot to pray
I been thinkin positive just not today
Feel like I ain't said a prayer since second grade
I need help before they take my breath away
My side bitch thing that she my wifey and i like it
Least my future bright i think i need a psychic
Yâ€™all been pissy drunk i'm screaming fuck that license
Spanish bitch with long flowing hair gets me excited
Yellow rollie the fifth he told me these niggas know me
Streets is lonely i pour out liquor for ones before me
I been happy that my nigga finally home
Just tryna find a way to put my nigga on

[Chorus]
