[Intro]
Yeah
Uh huh
I gotta feel it
Yeah, uh

[Verse]
I'm almost done with this rap thing
Sick and tired of the acting
These niggas lying, that's a fact, King
They don't love you 'less you dress like a drag queen
The fuck shit, I ain' into that
Too much frontin' on the internet
The streets want me to put a end to that
Too much dick ridin', where the killers at?
I'm surrounded by these hoe niggas
Like ain't no heaven for a dope dealer
Life is a fork in the road, nigga
Better run before the morgue or the parole get you
Sweatpants and some Margiellas
Just blew a bag on the bartender
Bad habits, man, we all sinners
The Devil callin', but this gun wit' us
Do this for my niggas in the trap, yeah
Years in the cell feelin' trapped in
Drunk inside a Bently, almost crashed it
To cover up my pain, I put tats there
Strippers in my cover I put hoes on
Runnin' 'round packin' like I'm in a war zone
All these lame niggas livin' while my dogs gone
How many diamonds in the crucifix? Lord knows
I am that nigga, these hoe niggas know it
I am that nigga, these hoe niggas know it
Pull up and pop out them benz's I hop out
Y'all know when I'm out them bitches gon' thot out
Fuck who don't feel me, y'all not gon' kill me
Y'all gon' ride out, who gon' come get me?
Inside the ghetto they call me a God
360 waves, hoes thought I was Nas
One time for Brooklyn, two times for Brooklyn
Whippin' that pot, don't it look like we cookin'
Came in a Wraith with your shorts on and Nikes
Walked in the strip club and left with a wife
I got that juice, I got that juice
Drug dealer sauce, shirt off in the coupe
Party and ball like I'm fresh off parole
Fuck a few girls off reality shows
I can't help but treat these rappers like hoes
Pray for the day these cowards exposed
Tell me who want it, racin' that foreign
I'm late for court, got couple warrants
I'm late for greatness, they tried to deny me of my greatness
Can't hide with lies in they faces
Show me love, but I rather they hate it
I am a legend and all, Glock'll ring out like the shots was indoors
Chopper sound like helicopters took off
Put a stop to that talk

[Chorus]
Nobody told me that the game hurts
Feel like the fame made the pain worse
I wanted them to know my name first
But now it feels like it ain't work
