[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
I spit that shit the streets got to feel
For Mike Brown and Sean Bell, a cop got to get killed
Cause I'm black, police think they got the right to shoot me
No jail for them, their punishment is desk duty
They're either killing us or throwing us in the cage
Martin Luther King is rolling over in his grave
(What happened to the dream?) Time to start killing these coppers
If Malcolm X was alive, he'll be next to me with them choppers
(At the window) By any means necessary, let's make 'em respect us
These cocksuckers supposed to protect us
Killing unarmed black men, making mothers holler
And this who the government paying with our tax dollars
All these unjustified shootings
Then they call us animals when we start looting
Those kids ain't had no gun and the police knew it
Jay need to talk to Obama or let me do it

[Hook: Jay Watts]
My hands up
(Yeah) Gonna feel like they just don't understand us
(They don't) Got to stay strong, hold on, keep our heads up
(You heard) Officer please don't shoot cause my hands up
My hands up, my hands up

[Verse 2: Maino]
Look how they do us, they're gunning us down
Black males on the menu, they're hunting us down
Put your foot inside my shoes, been running for miles
Who can we call, we alone, who holding us down (nobody)
My lil' homie told me he ready to riot
Ferguson was on his mind, he ready to fire
Staring at a cop who got death in his eyes
He want to kill me, I can tell, so my hands in the sky
I'm stressing so I'm grabbing my mac 11
Told my mamma I'm a end up on Channel 11
Leaving in a box or they'll take me away
Put away my Glock and I bought me a K
Black boys running from white cops
Who are they to determine just if our life stops
Please your honor, tell me if I'm a goner
"I can't breath, they're choking me", words from Eric Garner
You know this shit just ain't right
My son ask me this morning, "Daddy, we safe, right?" (No)
How the fuck I will tell him we ain't got the same rights
They put our babies in coffins, this shit just ain't life

[Hook]

[Outro: Uncle Murda (w/ Jay Watts)]
They don't even read us our rights (my hands up)
They don't got to pay for taking a life (my hands up)
It's like, even if they're wrong, they're right (my hands up
My hands up, my hands up)
