True Story

[Verse 1: Maino]
Look, I had a homie that used to tell me I would blow
But he died before he got to see me blow
Got killed, never thought I'd see him go
No funerals, I don't even wanna go
At his wake man I was just standing
And had the guts to see him in the casket
Damn, that's my nigga in that casket
In a million years I never would imagine
So I'm going out looking for my dawg
On the block getting bent for my dawg
God tell me why it hurt so bad
Why you take "little buck" why you take "Rav"
So I'm up nights cryin' on and off again
Drinkin' Henney, it makes me feel strong again
I don't wanna spend a day sober
I wanna feel numb all over

[Hook: Maino]
It feels like I'm floating on the clouds man (I'm High)
Things got to fly away (no lie)
I'mma drink my pain away (Oh god)
Let me see another day
Now we going get (right right right)
Let's get (right right right)
I feel so (right right right)
I wanna get (right right right)

[Verse 2: Maino]
Look, have you ever heard the cries of a broken man
Stared into the eyes of a hopeless man
No lies look I know this man
True Story I had went down on Gates Ave
Stray bullets flying out every where
Put my lil' man Moms in a wheelchair
And I don't even know what I should say to him
Cause I feel like, I can't relate to him
At the hospital, my eyes waterin'
Give anything to see Cory walk again
Type of shit makes me think about giving up
Put my pain in a white Styrofoam cup
I won't drink cause' I'm thirstin' (hey)
I drink cuz' I'm hurtin' (hey)
Greygoose, got me stumblin'
Man, I don't wanna feel nothing

[Hook: Maino]
It feels like I'm floating on the clouds man (I'm High)
Things got to fly away (no lie)
I'mma drink my pain away (Oh god)
Let me see another day
Now we goin' get (right right right)
Let's get (right right right)
I feel so (right right right)
I wanna get (right right right)

[Verse 3: Maino]
Yeah, and I don't wanna feel no pain no more
Somebody tell me why when it rains it pours
Feels like I'm wasting my life away
I'm high and I think I can fly away
More hennessy, niggas smoking weed
Can't hardly see, whats in front of me
What is wrong with me, what it's coming to
Somebody help me look at what I'm going through
I need another shot of patron
I don't wanna face the world on my own
I got friends that ain't never coming home
They call me and I try to tell them stay strong
He said Maino my life is all blown
My son gon' have grandkids when I come home
Damn, I could feel his pain through the phone
And all I could tell him was

[Hook: Maino]
It feels like I'm floating on the clouds man (I'm High)
Things got to fly away (no lie)
I'mma drink my pain away (Oh god)
Let me see another day
Now we goin' get (right right right)
Let's get (right right right)
I feel so (right right right)
I wanna get (right right right)
