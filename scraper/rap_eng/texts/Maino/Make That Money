[Chorus:]
(Make that money)
I get millionaire everybody want it [?]

Our whole world on the stream is that I make that money!
(Make that, make that money)

All I see is dollar sign, dollar sign
Big brown money bags with the dollar sign

Waking up in the hood, broke as a nightmare
[?] thinking about that big money [?] just to get money!

Spending like I just won the lotto [?] in a brand new Gallardo
(Make that money)
Nothing in this world is for free
Will you know, hustle harder than me

Our whole world on the stream is that I make that money!
(Make that, make that money)
