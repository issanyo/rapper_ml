[Intro]
This nigga Maino talkin' 'bout he the king. King of what? King of Brooklyn? He ain't no mothafuckin' King of Brooklyn
I just love me some Maino, he talk all that king shit. I love it, I love him, his Scarface ass

[Verse 1]
Yeah, niggas wanna play, okay
Hopped out all dope shade
Flow tighter than 25 niggas
That end up go to feds for a dope case
Yeah, real killer, I'm Ghostface
Gun boy bring pain like I tote things
Man it feels like yesterday I was just an ex-con
Just tryna freestyle on a Clue tape
Mothafucka I ain't rap back then
Just a little bitty nigga with a gat back then
Watched niggas lose their lives over crack back then
For you to wear jewels, had to ask back then
Flashback I was trappin' on a stoop pitchin'
That's when Jay Z was rappin' like [?]
Bankroll, look at how my ice glow
In a Hollywood home [?] kissin'
Yeah, OG to the young killers
Big homie to the gang members
See a couple young niggas, black bandanas on
Guns drawn, it's a good chance that I sent 'em
I said it, I said it, but y'all don't get it
The nigga that you idolize is my lieutenant
Shots gon' fly, hit your head through your fitted
Hole so big, you could stick a horseshoe in it
You fuckin' with a nigga that fuck with them niggas
That shot their own guns just for fuckin' with a nigga
I'm just fuckin' with you niggas
Swear to God, no friends, I ain't fuckin' with you niggas
Fuck fame, I ain't here for no celebrity
Bitch swallow like she ain't no celebrity
Good God, I done made a couple enemies
No problem 'cause they treat me like a Kennedy
You heard me, nigga, yeah you heard me, nigga

[Interlude]
I know Jermaine, I know Jermaine from way back. I mean he's cool but I wouldn't call him a king
Man that nigga was locked up with my man. My man said he was washin' clothes for Little Debbies, man that nigga sellin' dope

[Verse 2]
Yeah I do it for my niggas in the peno
In the yard, middle finger to the C.O
Came home and you gotta find a job
Got a bitter baby moms and you really hate your P.O
Hundred grams but you wish it was a kilo
On parole but you ridin' with a nino
Niggas want a war, they don't really want war
If they want it, I'll go at 'em with a fuckin' torpedo
What these niggas wanna do?
I'll fix it where these niggas can't move
Just the other day, little homie came and told me
Said, "Big homie all I ever really wanna do is shoot"
Playin' with your life like that
How many chains rappers have to buy back?
Niggas fuck around, I'll send a couple hounds
Put this lame on the ground with his vertebrae cracked
I'm king of these mothafuckin'  back streets
For green, niggas love me like I'm [?]
One time for my [?] niggas
I'm [?] boy in a Maybach, nigga
Addicted to the money, get it ASAP, nigga
Got a fuckin' problem like I'm A$AP, nigga
It ain't a live nigga in this town that I don't know
We bump heads like Ocho
Them lil' niggas on the block gettin' dumb, gettin' drunk
Pop pills and bust shots at the popo
Yeah, how many bitches wanna know if I live it?
Broke niggas say it's all about lyrics
Fuck them, this for the niggas that feel it
I talk money, gun smoke, y'all hear it
One life, one love, you've heard of me
One crown, one throne, K.O.B
You heard me, nigga, yeah you heard me, nigga

[Outro]
Well I heard he been to jail before and he got street credibility and this and that and this and that, but that doesn't make him king. Man nobody wanna hear that "I'm a real nigga," we don't give a fuck if you a real nigga. That shit don't sell records
