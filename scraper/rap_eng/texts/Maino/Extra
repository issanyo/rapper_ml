[Intro: Marlo]
Hundred pounds by the dresser
A hundred pounds by the dresser, them bales came with extra

[Chorus: Marlo]
A hundred pounds by the dresser, them bales came with extra
We get the work in and then we press it
He ran off on the plug and then we stressed him
Them ducks we finessing, a couple brick plays and then we flexin'
We the only niggas getting money
We the only niggas getting money
I know a couple niggas getting money
I know a couple niggas getting money
You ain't shit if you ain't getting money
You ain't shit if you ain't getting money
You ain't shit if you ain't getting money
I know a couple niggas getting money
I know a couple niggas getting money
We the only niggas getting money

[Verse 1: Maino]
Niggas talkin' 'bout they getting money
I'm stacking hundreds, stacking blue hundreds
I'm stacking dead faces, I'm beating court cases
I'm in the pot, water whipping, tryna hard base it, yeah
And I'm re-rocking the blow, and I got J's at the door
They want a brick for the low, to put on my at my low, yeah
I'm calling shots like the head doctor
I'm beating cases so the feds watching
These niggas lame, watching
These niggas pillow talking
Yeah, I'm steady bankroll walking
Yeah, please feed the kitchen water whipping
Me and Marlo gettin' it in, fuck them bitches

[Chorus: Marlo]
A hundred pounds by the dresser, them bales came with extra
We get the work in and then we press it
He ran off on the plug and then we stressed him
Them ducks we finessing, a couple brick plays and then we flexin'
We the only niggas getting money
We the only niggas getting money
I know a couple niggas getting money
I know a couple niggas getting money
You ain't shit if you ain't getting money
You ain't shit if you ain't getting money
You ain't shit if you ain't getting money
I know a couple niggas getting money
I know a couple niggas getting money
We the only niggas getting money

[Verse 2: Marlo]
A couple bales for the low, a couple bricks for the high
I ain't lying, when 12 told me testify I'd rather die
I got 9th Ward pumpin', the bitch jumping like it's Shoe Street
I know some young niggas quick to sweep you off your feet
A thousand bales came through the mail
I broke 'em down with no fuckin' help
We on the road, lil one made the left
This bitch bunking, gotta watch for 12
We take you out, don't care who you is
We sipping syrup and we poppin' pills
The way we looking we already got a deal
A hundred bands, just got off the Lear
But them bitches came wwith extra
And we get the work in and then we bless it
And no stressing, no freshin'

[Chorus: Marlo]
A hundred pounds by the dresser, them bales came with extra
We get the work in and then we press it
He ran off on the plug and then we stressed him
Them ducks we finessing, a couple brick plays and then we flexin'
We the only niggas getting money
We the only niggas getting money
I know a couple niggas getting money
I know a couple niggas getting money
You ain't shit if you ain't getting money
You ain't shit if you ain't getting money
You ain't shit if you ain't getting money
I know a couple niggas getting money
I know a couple niggas getting money
We the only niggas getting money
