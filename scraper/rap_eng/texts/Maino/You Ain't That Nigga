[Verse 1: Maino]
Your whole life is on Instagram
Ghost as shit, you ain't living man
With them cars I don't see 'em, damn
You ain't that nigga
Fake fuck, fake life, fake Roley, fake ice
In the club, no ace right
You ain't that nigga
Telling people you rich hah
You the leader of the Crips hah
Model chick is your bitch hah
You ain't that nigga
You don't know real killers boy
Ain't been around drug dealing boy
Get a load of this fuck boy
You ain't that nigga
Tricking all in this bitch
I just nutted all in this bitch
You still liking all of her pits
You know that car ain't yours dog
You front for all of these whores dog
Cut it out come on dog
You ain't down you photo bombing
Taking pics with rap niggas
Groupie's how you act nigga
You ain't that nigga
Yo niggas ain't hard as mine
You pop shit but you hard to find
In the club your card declined
You ain't that nigga

[Sample]
You fucked up big time
You're incapable of running this shit
Sit your five dollar ass down before I make change

[Verse 2]
Lame nigga you been a liar
Coke talk your drug supplier
Where your name, you ain't on the flier
You chill with her, you ain't fuck Rihanna
I was sent to bring all that back
Block work, bring the corners back
Five nines and a couple Macs
Damn they know all of that
You a shooter caught bodies hah
Jumping out of Bugatis hah
You promoted this party hah
You ain't that nigga
In the strip club no dollar bills
But you still trying to cop a feel
Bitches said you not real
You ain't that nigga
You stay fly on designer hah
Big baller, you buying hah
Baby mama can't find you hah
You ain't that nigga
Fake thug, you Twitter talking
Lame nigga, you pillow talking
She don't like it, you still stalking
You ain't that nigga
From the first page you been a lame
No dope boy you ain't in the game
Stop trying to be what you ain't
You ain't that nigga
This the shit that you niggas love
This the shit that you bitches want
These the niggas you think is cool
These the niggas you showing love
Same niggas that'll like her
Is the same nigga that'll like him
I know niggas just like him
He ain't that nigga
