[Intro]
Thanks man
Don't you say that shit Maino!
Don't say it!
Haha, yeah, watch yo mouth!

[Hook]
You gon' make me kill you
You keep on fuckin' wit me
Police gon' come and get me
Cause I'ma mess around and kill you
I ain't no woman beater, but I ain't pussy neither
You make me mad enough to kill you
Look how you got me goin
You keep on askin for it
You won't be happy 'til I kill you

[Verse 1]
Yeah, where did we grow apart? You got my fuckin' child
How did the drama start? I tried to play my part
But you be stressin' me, you pushin' me
Talk to me crazy, look how you testing me
You bugged out, look what you did
You made us enemies
My blood pressure risin', im ridin', drinkin' Hennessy
Thinking of multiple ways to put a hurtin' on you
I need you out of my life
Pull the curtains on you
You see what hate'll do?
Look what you made me do
Now bitch you make me so mad I wanna strangle you
I need to pray for you, no I need to pray for me
You make me ready to burst, the way you play with me
Look at how you act up, that's why I backed up
I been hoping you get hit by a Mack truck
This the shit I contemplate
They'll never hear your screams with a pillow to your face

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I used to spoil you
Now I got a trunk and a shovel for you
This ain't what I wanna do
This what you made me
Can't see my son again, driving me crazy
Back and forth with you again
All in my place see
I'ma get it over with
Rock-a-bye baby
I could see it all now
You gon get your neck broke
I'ma make the news, have my face on New York One
Standing in the courtroom, forgive me you honor
I just had to kill my baby mama, holla
I'ma give you what you want from me
This is what you want from me
You gon' look better girl, layin in my trunk funny
I can't explain to my son about your death
That's the only reason I ain't push you off a roof yet
But I'ma fuck around and break, I swear
They gon' find your ass floatin in the lake somewhere

[Hook]

[Outro]
Jermaine! (Jermaine)
