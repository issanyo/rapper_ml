[Intro: Lil' Kim]
I know they see us coming
I know they see us coming
Ayo Desiigner!
We see you, baby
Welcome to the Royal Brooklyn Family
I ain't came to play, I came to slay

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
I got killas in Belize
I got niggas in the league
NBA, NHL, MLB
Watch how I go off on the Hennessy
NFL no sacks
I got the ball like a running back
My nigga OT with a hundred packs
I hit the mall with a hundred racks
Two straps like a backpack
Rolls Royce and a Maybach
Back to Back like a Drake rap
Drive the Rari like I'm on a race track
White kicks Buscemi
Black Whip Borghini
Back on top like a beanie
Eat the booty like zucchini
He pulled it out, it was teeny
Pour some ketchup on that weenie
My niggas pour lean in Bellinis
My pussy wet like a bikini
Getting cheese, fettuccine
Move and work out the deli
Move my body like a genie
Disappear, Makaveli

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
White mink, panda
I got white, Hannah
I feel like Tony Montana
White diamonds, panda

[Verse 2: Maino]
I got broads in Atlanta
Couple broads that are scammers
They work hard to Atlanta
To hit the malls in Atlanta
YSL, fly as hell
Party like we just got out of jail
Couple my shooters fresh out on bail
I keep them bitches that's bad as hell
I blew my money in aces
I’ve seen your woman crush naked
Fuck and forgot what her name is
She didn’t even know what a wraith is
Hop out the Rolly Royce
Diamonds all over my rolly boy
You fell in love with the bitch
Did you think you was her only boy?
I am the king of the streets
Niggas you look up to cater to me
Always been full, with the k in the street
I told ‘em that I would be back with the queen
Ya done messed up, feel the pressure
Chain too big, can’t lift my neck up
Just one hand, I lift the tech up
At his head, 'case he vest up! Aye

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
White mink, panda
I got white, Hannah
I feel like Tony Montana
White diamonds, panda
