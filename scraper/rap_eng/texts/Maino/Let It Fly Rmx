(WELCOME TO BROOKLYN!)
Now-Now my name ring, my chain bling, got sparkles over my champagne
My bitch is bad, these niggas mad, I guess that's just what the fame brings
Brooklyn boy get plenty love, on that turnpike with my Philly broad
Miami bound with my D.C. chick and we let it fly when we in the club
I'm worldwide I'm certified, pop a bottle my Cali dime
Photogenic, windows tinted, what type of car the Ferrari kind
I'm on the grind never slowin up, pop cash and throw it up
Haters watch while I do it up, THE REMIX BITCH I'm BLOWIN UP!
Ok now hold up, swole up, my bank roll it don't fold up
Hatin me nigga so what, twenty grand for me to show up
Next month I want that plus, money long as your tour bus
Hit the club and I let it fly, claim you ballin niggas tellin lies
Stare in the club in his own eyes, champagne I sip mine
Ball out, ball hard, you can't 'cause it's rent time
Straight G's in my frontline, sound fit they got alpine
Blowin bands in that strip club, count it up in your down time
HA!
NOW LET ME SEE YOUR! Hands in the airrrrrrr!
Let-Let-Let-Let it fly!
Drinks in the airrrrrrr! Let-Let-Let-Let it fly!

Drinks in the airrrrrrr! Let it fly!
{Let it fly! Let-Let-Let-Let it fly!}
Count D, M.I.A, twenty racks, let it fly
That your man? Excuse yourself, be polite, tell him bye
Hoes know when we in this bitch we make it rain and ain't never dry
White cups, Cali kush, everybody 'round me hardly high, Ha!
Where Maino at? In my new whip with the same old strap
Red beam on it like they know back, high price on it volcano rap
Put my name on that and the hood go crazy, and the hood go crazy
It's double MG but I'm 'bout that Cash Money like Baby
BITCH!
Bow our heads, say our grace, make it out the hood was Amazing Grace
Forty on the lap just to play it safe, roll your lights with the plain face
Tell me how the life with the fam taste? Tell me slow down 'cause it ain't a race
Bought two cars on the same day, f*ck two broads on the same night
F*cked your broad 'cause my game tight, sit ringside at the main fight
Brand new Airs called Gang White, feels so good but it ain't right
HA! HA! HA! Had ten minutes still made the flight
I told the pilot, let it fly, I'm in BK and I'm in Bed-Stuy (LET'S GO!)
NOW LET ME SEE YOUR! Hands in the airrrrrrr!
Let-Let-Let-Let it fly!
Drinks in the airrrrrrr! Let-Let-Let-Let it fly!
{REMIX!}
Ballin in herrrrrrre! Let-Let-Let-Let it fly!
Drinks in the airrrrrrr! Let it fly!
{Let it fly! Let-Let-Let-Let it fly!}
(Yeah! Alright!)
Ok! Polo with no horse though, D.C. well of course though
My whores go when they throat hurt, I switched heads Lee Corso
Game tight with that flow love, Maino well like Roy Jones
I'm out BK with these fast girls and all my cash good I mean slow bucks
Make a straight lame Joe open up, Tori Birchard she know's what's up
No coach bag if I go with that, snake skin, toe that, cobra clutch
Dough ain't nothin to joke about, she open up when that dough come out
I might bless a chick, say yes a little though on
I'm optimistic I'm a throw a knot (LET'S GO!)
WALE!
