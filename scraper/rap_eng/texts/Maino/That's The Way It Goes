Ohhh-Ohhh-ooooh, do-do-do-dooooo-do-do-do-do-dooooo
Oooh-aaaah-oooooh-ooooooh
Chorus
When I got money, everybody loves me
Ain't Got no money, some niggas acting funny
And when I'm hungry, they can't do nothing for me
That's the way, the way it goes
Cos when I'm home they, say that they my homies
And when I'm gone then, they don't even know me
Now I'm hot and, niggas wanna show me, Show me looove-
That's the way it goes
I remember waking up to the sight of steel bars, it was dark
I couldn't see the sun through the bars, freezin in the cell
I was trapped in these walls, no letter, no girl
Just the comfort of the walls
But the world dah'nt change, since the flow dah'nt change and
Everybody here now, that ain't no name*
Lord protect me from my friends, I can deal with my enemies
But I ain't sure who's a friend or an enemy
Since the Smack DVD's, everybody lovin' me
But when I was thirsty, they wouldn't hawk-spit on me
Bitches poppin up, Wow, now they wanna get with me
Fifteen years, same bitches wasn't missin me
Man it's funny how, people act funny style
Niggas switch, when they think you getting money now
When the sun shines, niggas wanna come round
But they disappear, when that rain starts coming down
Chorus
What's good, different day, same shit
It's amazing, how success change shit
Now niggas trying to, count what's in my pocket
They be like "Can I hold", "Nah homie, I ain't got it" (Damn)
You trying to cling to me, you ain't deceiving me
And when I started, you niggas, y'a di'nt believe in me
Instead of support, y'all just hated
Said I'm too wild to rap, I ain't supposed to make it
That's fucked up yo', but I'm supposed to take it
No you got the nerve to act like, we related
Just yesterday, I couldn't get a dime from nobody
Couldn't get studio, time from nobody
Now you're going to believe me, you told me I'm *wholebody
Did it myselfs dawg, we di'nt have nobody
Hustle Hard, we bout to *E-Ride
These leeched niggas hands out, looking for free rides
Chorus
Yeah listen
I got family popping up, out of nowhere (oh yeah?)
Got a bunch of new cousins, coming out, all year
If I knew I had, this much love
Might have never hit the street, might have never sold drugs
Might have stayed up in school and, never popped guns
And been a better role model, for my own son
Where was you, when my life was needy
And my pops was high, my momma could not feed me
And the lights was off, and the block would tease me
You wasn't there, when shit wasn't easy
Before rap, niggas they'din't hold it down
Since I'm hot, of course, everybody love me now
Chorus
