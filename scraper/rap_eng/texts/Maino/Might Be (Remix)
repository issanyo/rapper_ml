[Intro]
Wait
3, aye

[Hook]
I got a feeling that you might be (high)
Do I turn you on?
You can tell me if I'm wrong
Girl, I think you might be (high)
And she don't even smoke
But she swear I got that dope dick
Love it when I fuck her and she's (high)
Aye, high sex is the best sex
Whenever she stressed
She just want to get (high)
Well, get high, baby
Get high, baby

[Verse 1: DJ Luke Nasty]
Is you rolling? I might be
You the shit, you the sugar, honey, iced tea
What I got to hint for?
You know I'm a nympho
On my Marshawn Lynch
You know what I'm here for (aye)
Riding through the city and get (high)
Take you to the crib and have one hell of a night
It's ironic cause we on cloud (high)
Girl make up your mind
Is you mine or you mine? Aye
Henny what I'm drinking, she got Remy in her cup
She break down the weed, I break down the dutch
Body like J'lo after (high) she had enough
She caught contact, now she tryna fuck

[Hook]
I got a feeling that you might be (high)
Do I turn you on?
You can tell me if I'm wrong
Girl, I think you might be (high)
And she don't even smoke
But she swear I got that dope dick
Love it when I fuck her and she's (high)
Aye, high sex is the best sex
Whenever she stressed
She just want to get (high)
Well, get high, baby
Get high, baby

[Verse 2: Maino]
I asked her if she comin' home, she said she might be
She could kick off her Lou's like they Huarache Nike
Ask me if I might be (high)
I'm just enjoying life
You are my wife tonight
So, excuse me if I might seem (high)
I'm just calling you beauty
Can I rub on your booty?
She said, "Long as you throw dollars up (high)
Boy, you know I'm working
So, just let me finish twerking
'Cause lately, I've got bills so (high)"
I just wanted to talk
Have you been to New York?
'Cause, girl, you so fly that you (high)
I've been waiting just to touch you
'Cause tonight I think I love you

[Hook]
I got a feeling that you might be (high)

And she don't even smoke
But she swear I got that dope dick
Love it when I fuck her and she's (high)
Aye, high sex is the best sex
Whenever she stressed
She just want to get (high)
Well, get high, baby
Get high, baby

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Negativity at an all time (high)
They want no small fry, this ain't no Big Mac
She like it when I put her legs (high)
That is my lifestyle
She wanted pipe down I told her to pipe down
I count a milli while I'm getting (high)
I don't need no vixen, I just need a girl to raise the kids
And do the fucking dishes
I'm the one that's known to get it (high)
Better known as Titty Boi
Maybe do this summer 'cause you skiing when the winter come
Coochie warm, text your phone (high)
What you doing, baby?
Feeling so exuberated, juvenile rejuvenated
Drop it down and bring it back (high)
Rough sex is the best sex
Lay you down flat, kiss your neck
Make you kiss my tats (high)
Make you go to sleep
It's so hot we need the windows cracked
When you next to me, I make you feel like you (high)
Still intact and this
Might be a threesome if you interact, yeah

[Hook]
I got a feeling that you might be (high)
Do I turn you on?
You can tell me if I'm wrong
Girl, I think you might be (high)
And she don't even smoke
But she swear I got that dope dick
Love it when I fuck her and she's (high)
Aye, high sex is the best sex
Whenever she stressed
She just want to get (high)
Well, get high, baby
Get high, baby
