(Maino)

Yea, yea, yea yea, like photos in my mind, you the vision in my dreams, and what I see is perfect, I picture you my queen. staring at your
Finger got me picturing the ring, you my 50 inch plasma the picture in my screen, but something ain't adding up, my math ain't equaling, you looking for the love, im selfish with my feelings eh. pushing for commitment im running from commitment, scared to open up and you wonder why im distant, trying to push away, youre the only one that knows me, feelings in the air. im afraid you might expose me, I don't mean to leave you heartbroken sleepless but im scared to give you my heart and you keep it

(Alicia Keys)

Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me
And all the time you were tellin' me lies

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed

Lonely, on me nobody ever shut down it down like you
You want a crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Near me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me

Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me
You know that I'll always be in love with you right til the end OOh

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's bound to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
We'll just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
