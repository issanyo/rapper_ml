Yea
For Zane, my future

Hook:
Man I feel like a runaway slave
Can?t calm down
Never gon behave
My back to the wind
My spirit in the sky
I?m never giving in
Middle finger up high
And even when I die
Don?t shed a tear when I?m laid
I feel like a runaway slave
I said I feel like a runaway slave
Sometimes I feel like a runaway slave

Listen?

Verse 1:
I could die before I get rich never touch a mill
Die before my album drops never sell a mill
Die before I get to see how success feels
Die before any of my dreams are fulfilled
Die before I really start livin out my plans
Die before I see my son grow into a man
Die before my niggas come home from they bids
Die before I truly learn how to really live
Now it feels like I know death
Gotta watch my own steps

Wonder my niggas ain't around cuz they all left
Pride in the ring contemplating on my own death
Shots fly niggas tryin to kill my on my doorstep
How they gon remember me? What?ll be my legacy?
How they gon talk about me when they pour that hennessy?
That nigga thug, that nigga was a rider
That nigga was one hell of a survivor
Niggas in the pen with no money for bail
Every nigga on the run tryin to stay up outta jail
I could feel ya?

Yea I know, hold on and be strong my niggas

Hook:
Man I feel like a runaway slave
Can?t calm down
Never gon behave
My back to the wind
My spirit in the sky

I?m never giving in
Middle finger up high
And even when I die
Don?t shed a tear when I?m laid
I feel like a runaway slave
I said I feel like a runaway slave
Sometimes I feel like a runaway slave

Verse 2:
I could die before I bring happiness to my momma
Die before I make peace with my baby momma
Die before I squash all my bullshit drama
Die but don?t cry this is death before dishonor
This is my last will and testament
Listen to my testament
Please raise Zane to be a leader and a gentleman
I don?t have regrets all the times that I was negligent
Standing in the courtroom fronting like im innocent
Look at how I came up
Duckin undercover men
Friends getting railroaded hung by his government
This is what they made me
Hell is what they gave me
Homies coming home on parole but they ain?t free
Look at me, look at life, how im supposed to change huh?
Im feelin like a runaway slave ma
Can't calm down I refuse to be tamed
Standing in these 4 walls banging on the cage
Niggas on the jail bus handcuffed and chained
When its said and done they gon remember my name
Now mommy in the front row, sittin at my funeral
Everybody cryin?, just another death as usual
You feel me?
