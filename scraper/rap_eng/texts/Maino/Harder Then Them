[Hook]
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them

[Verse 1]
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
Harder than all of these niggas, I'm way more harder than them
Look at these niggas, how hard they pretend
Look how they actin', they hardly as men
Who can you call when it feels like the end?
Plus you just wishin' a real nigga win
I'ma go harder than Puff in a coupe
Hard like I'm Biggie, now gimme the loot
I am the king of the streets and they to me
If I give them the word, they gon' shoot
I am the best but these haters don't show it
This is my city, they already know it
Niggas'll die if they're feelin' heroic
My Glock got a body, now who wanna hold it?
Don't tell the police I'm strapped
Don't tell the police I'm strapped
Tell all these niggas I'm back
Tell all these niggas I'm back
King's home in his king throne
See the crown on this king's dome?
Goin' ape shit, I'm King Kong
Chopped off like a ringtone

[Hook]
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them

[Verse 2]
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
Harder than Hov, harder than when he was back on the boat
Harder than crackers, had blacks on the ropes
Harder than ridin' with kilos of coke
Harder than tryna make millions off dope
Harder than tryna make wives out of hoes
I am the heart of the streets
Harder than niggas, who harder than me?
Shawty said, "Maino I know you go hard
But you don't go harder than me"
Man just from the start I've been hustlin' hard
Feel on my pain, baby touch on my scars
I've been through hell, what they know about hard?
Woke up this mornin' and felt like I'm God
I am the realest, we nothin' alike
Niggas that love me in jail doin' life
Harder than goin' to war with a knife
Please tell the lord that I'm sinnin' tonight
Lost my religion, I'm finished with Christ
Heard about Moses, let's bring him to life
Let 'em all know I'm a villain for life

[Hook]
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
I'ma go harder than them, I'ma go harder than them
