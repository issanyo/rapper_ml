[Verse 1: Maino]
I'm the leader of the movement
The blueprint I put goons in
If you sick and tired of the lies
I'm where the truth went
I'm alive, the winning kind
I see dollar signs idolized
Fuck every bitch on my timeline
Who am I? The K.O.B. motherfucker
Thirty chains like Mr. T motherfucker
Niggas follow me like they reading from the Quran
Fuck hoes my bitch she flying in from Milan
Real respect real I pack steal ridiculous
Villainous, these lame niggas is frivolous
Remember us? The doule R we hustle hard
Shines bright like 40 lights from 20 cars
Uh, treat movie bitches like groupie bitches
Yeah, I'm daydreaming on newly riches
Yeah, no rap star or actor
Been ready I blast off like Nasa

[Hook]
Who am I?
The K.O.B. motherfucker, K.O.B. motherfucker
Thirty chains like Mr. T motherfucker
Real respect real
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Everybody Gs, homey please
These niggas weak, if I squeeze
They gon' bleed, put 'em to sleep
I'm a general for my criminals stacking revenues
Vamanos, these lames fall like dominos
Ruthless, got one gun with two clips
Group shit, one dick for two chicks
Goon shit, a couple Bloods, a few Crips
Coupe 6 hopping out for a few flicks
Living better now Gucci leather now (baby)
'Cause I used to chase I don't remember now
On that fly shit, your highness the livest
Surprise bitch, you went back you my bitch
Yeah, to touch me you need an elevator
Top floor, good view I'm in heavy hater
It's rules to, it's deep-rooted I been through it
You couldn't do it, you boys blew it let's get to it

[Hook]
