[Intro: Maino]
Unstoppable
Y-yeah
Y-yeah
Maino

[Hook: Maino]
I got women in the 'burbs, women in the the hood
Yeah my wifey mad, 'cause she knows I'm no good
Man I'm just a dog, I'd be faithful if I could
But I'm Tiger Woods, yeah, I'm Tiger Woods
Go get'em Tiger, get 'em Tiger
Go get'em, go go go get'em, go get'em Tiger
Get'em Tiger, get'em Tiger
Go get'em, go go go get'em, go get'em Tiger

[Verse 1: Maino]
I need help 'cause I know I got a problem
Every bad bitch I come across, I think I want 'em
Look at how I roll when I see 'em, then I'm on 'em
Drunk full of liquor, and a pocket full of condoms
Lord I can't lie, I'm a dog, I'm a cheater
Baby Momma gone 'cause I ain't know how'ta treat her
Shout out to Na'isha, shout out to Latisha
Shout out to my shorty with that little white Beamer
Feeling like a king, got women that'll treat me
I be going hard, got a dime down in D.C
Yeah my wifey home, and I'm wrong for what I'm doing yo
I be out creeping, lying, said I'm in the studio

[Hook: Maino]

[Verse 2: Maino]
I got a stripper named Bird in Miami
Got a little model that I see when I'm in Cali
I be running down on them R&B broads
Cop chick, let me fuck her in her uniform
Now tell me if I'm wrong, 'cause I be chasing coochie
I be into girls that's into eating coochie
Shorty had me going, had me open off her coochie
Going to her projects, buying her Gucci
My girl probably know 'cause I ain't ever home
I could never let her find what's in my camera-phone
Got picture of Sh'wan, Tiffany, and all 'em
Pictures of the twins, I was humping both'em

[Hook: Maino]

[Verse 3: Maino]
I'm Tiger Woods, yup I'm Tiger Woods
And I'm truly sorry I know that I'm no good
I would keep it real, be faithful if I could
But I'm Tiger Woods, yup, I'm Tiger Woods
I got women in the 'burbs, women out the country
Women that I hurt, I'm sorry I know you love me
I could feel your pain, please accept my apologies
The ones that ever, been pregnant by me
Nah Baby, not me
Not the one you settle down with
I'm the type that call up your friend, and mess around with
This is who I am, this is how I love
Still trying to find a place, to swing my golf club
