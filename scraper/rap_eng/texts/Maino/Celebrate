Maino: Just when I started to feel like there was no more hope-is when hope presented it self. And just like that my life changed. Man, so I guess tomorrow really did come. Yeah, tomorrow?s here

Ohhh!
Yea, look at me now!
That?s right
I?m happy baby
Lets celebrate

Hook:
Stand up now
Hands up now
Look at me baby
I dun came up now
We dun came too far to give up now
Pop more bottles lets do it up now
Celebrate it!
Celebrate it!
It?s a holiday nigga I made it!
Celebrate it!
Celebrate it!
It?s a holiday nigga I made it!

Verse 1:
Yea, feel the wind breeze
See the palm trees
I could feel the clouds in a drop GT
Who would ever think I would make it out the street?
My whole life around drugs and the Police
Remember nights I was stuck in a jail yard
When I couldn?t see the sun through the cell bars
Now my whole world changed and it feels odd
Can?t believe it, this is what I tell God
I made it, upgraded, man I found me a dream and I chased it
I was wasting time in and out of cages
Now I?m in that S6, feels like a spaceship
We gon drink for my homies cuz they ain?t here
One more for my niggas in the pen, yea
I coulda been a ghost but I?m still here
Can?t forget where I come from, hell yea

Hook:
Stand up now
Hands up now
Look at me baby
I dun came up now
We dun came too far to give up now
Pop more bottles lets do it up now
Celebrate it!
Celebrate it!
It?s a holiday nigga I made it!
Celebrate it!
Celebrate it!
It?s a holiday nigga I made it!

Verse 2:
To the top now
Im a pop now
I got both feet planted
Can?t stop now
Mo? money, fast women is my lifestyle
Look at me buying everything I like now
Never thought that I would turn my life round
It?s like a crap game, couldn?t put the dice down
I was hopeless, heart broke, and guilty
I was raised off of oatmeal and grilled cheese
If you been where I been you gotta feel me
An example of what a street dream means
Man I made something out of nothing
Started out hand to hand on the block pumping
Look at me now CO, you see me now PO?
I dun came up, now I?m CEO
Career criminal, against all odds
I climbed out the dirt, now I glow with the stars

Hook:
Stand up now
Hands up now
Look at me baby
I dun came up now
We dun came too far to give up now
Pop more bottles lets do it up now
Celebrate it!
Celebrate it!
It?s a holiday nigga I made it!
Celebrate it!
Celebrate it!
It?s a holiday nigga I made it!

Verse 3:
You wanna eat Duke?
Nigga me too
I can't preach to you if I can?t feed you
I?ll tell you what though
I hope these words reach you
Cuz you never know where life?ll lead you
We gon party for my niggas that died young
Too soon, never seen the other side son
I got homies that been locked up since 9-1
And I?m thinking man, that could?ve been my life son
Floatin in that big body Benz
Starin at the stars
Look how lucky I am
I could?ve been dead
I could?ve been gone
I guess I am blessed, look at where I came from

Hook:
Stand up now
Hands up now
Look at me baby

I dun came up now
We dun came too far to give up now
Pop more bottles lets do it up now
Celebrate it!
Celebrate it!
It?s a holiday nigga I made it!
Celebrate it!
Celebrate it!
It?s a holiday nigga I made it! (Repeat)
