[Verse One: Maino]
MAINO! Yeah I'm never goin back again, never 'gon fail again
Promise to myself that I never see a jail again
Never see that big yard waitin on some mail again
Never see them corw bars sittin in a cell again
Livin like a savage dude savin up my cans of food
Keep on disrespectin me they treat me like an animal
Mi nah goin back again I done gave them crackers ten
I was just an inmate I probably wasn't rappin then
Now I'm on that TV yo, tell that C.O. kiss my ass
Pull up on my P.O. in that Maserati paper tag
They was always doubtin me but now I'm countin property
Never goin back (Why?) cause real niggas count on me

[Hook: Busy Signal]
So we nah go a jail again! (OH NO!!!!)

[Verse Two: Maino]
Yeah! Listen! Listen!
Look at the life I'm livin, all different kinds of linen
Platinum and diamond jewels I've done said goodbye to prison
My niggas still losin, come on it's time for winnin
My homey's CD blew, what type of time he gettin?!
We just lost JD, but still we gotta get it
Can't nothin stop my grind, I got to stay drivin
I mean I'm all alone, wishin that my homey's home
Feelin like my life is different since my nigga Dice been gone
Know how it feels in there, baby it's hell in there
When my man Ceno come home he ain't goin back in there
Never see jail again, mi nah fail again
Peace to the cat Auburn, Elmont, and Glendon dem!

[Hook: Busy Signal]
So we nah go a jail again! (OH NO!!!!)
