[Verse 1: Will Roush]
Hey girl, what you doing to me?
I don't know if she prove it to me
She wanna come to my crib, break it down for me (oh)

Imma spend my money on it (oh)
Put money on it (oh)
Tax, made backs, oh yeah I'm talking plaques

[Chorus: Will Roush]
Oh my God, the way she ride on me
I think I need that ass in my family tree
Now let me see that ass girl, woo, now let me see it
Now let me see that ass girl, let me see that ass girl (woo)
Now let me see it, now let me see that ass girl, let me see that ass, girl

Now let me see it, now let me see that ass girl, let me see that ass

[Verse 2: Will Roush]
In the hood, real good 'cause I got a hood pass and you know I still could
If I roll up, I roll up on it, woah
That booty imma swole up on it, swole up
Okay girl, what you know 'bout it?
Show me that booty, go round 'bout it
Round bottom to Will, Imma have to it best [?]
Oh shit girl, if your ass was a song it'd be a hit, girl
You wanna make something special to it, girl, hey
You could have my baby or two I'm like

[Verse 3: Maino]
Let me see that ass girl, let me see it
I ain't throwing out a dollar 'til I see it
Everything's feeling right tonight
Seems like I might've found my wife tonight
Shawty got a body like a stripper
I ain't sure if I kiss her, do I tip her?
Well a couple more bottles of that liquor
And I'm gonna make her cry when I lick her
So my nigga Will Roush bring 'em out
And then a couple drinks, I see what they about
Heard that she got an ass like she was from the South
Now she's in my family tree since I bought her to my house

[Chorus & Outro: Will Roush]
Oh my God, the way she ride on me
I think I need that ass in my family tree
Now let me see that ass girl, woo, now let me see it
Now let me see that ass girl, let me see that ass girl (woo)
Now let me see it, now let me see that ass girl, let me see that ass, girl
Now let me see it, now let me see that ass girl, let me see that ass, girl (woo)
Now let me see it, now let me see that ass girl, let me see that ass
