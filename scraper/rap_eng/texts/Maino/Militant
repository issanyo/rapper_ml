[Chorus:]
All my niggas gangbang
Black flag on the right side
Glock 40s got clips
Ski masks on the night time
Light that bitch nigga up
Might not be a next time
That art of war shit we living it
All my niggas be militant (all my niggas be militant) (X5)

[Verse 1:]
All my niggas be militant
All black on like a motherfucking terrorist
Got a couple shots for these boys like medicine
Scream out free my niggas at their sentencing
Niggas wanna play kid games
Too old for this shit
Glock 9 and a black rolls royce in this bitch
Park up start throwing crows in this bitch
Get a nigga wet like a got a hose in this bitch
Gun play and all that, I'm bout it
You don't wanna die now, i doubt it
Wanna roll with a king? How 'bout it
Pull up in the benz coupe, hop out it
All my niggas be militant
Don't these little niggas look menacing?
Pull up on the block get a word like a reverend
Shots keep coming like a bunch of text messages

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
All my niggas be militant
No refs, [?] free life we living it
Caught up in the game still here We been in it
40 cal underneath the suit like a gentleman
One more time for the homies in the pen
See you when you're free or when they put me in
Up daydreaming, huggin on that mac 10
Lame ass industry, won't let a thug in
From the start I told them I don't like these niggas
Im different, now tell em I ain't like these niggas
Caught in the street I indict these niggas
Then I tell the little homies dont sight these niggas
Tell them not to push me, i'll do it
Hands on the Ak, i shoot it
All these niggas bitch made, i knew it
Nigga if you G'd up then prove it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
All my hittas be militant
If my niggas dealing rocks, they slinging shit
Get it right back then we triple it
Get it out the gutter motherfucker we whipping it
Chin check nigga we stitching em
Black ski masks and some timberlands
If it ain't about the money we ain't listening
Sorrounded by the real if you phoney keep your distances
We ain't gon' play this that KOB 2
Want wave or main its whoever she choose
Go against the grain I would hate to be you
Shooters gon' spray at his fitted he through
Shoulda played that shit cool
One time for the real niggas
Two time for the real hitters
Y'all niggas computer thugs
Ain't really bout it yall be catfishing
Come at us the wrong way
Catch you and your man slipping
Double clips from far away
Got a nigga backflipping
Creeping at his mom's place
They can change their addresses
We don't leave a calm case herbie call the paramedics
And no i don't glorify murder
I ain't never kill nobody
But a nigga act tough
My niggas gonna be shooting shit up
Or they gon' have to shut down that party

[Chorus]
