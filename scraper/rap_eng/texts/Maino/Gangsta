[Verse 1: Maino]
Listen I got real niggas that love me, fake niggas that's hatin', mad bitches that want me
Snitch niggas is waitin'
Old G's sayin' how I remind them on how they used to be
If you never heard of me yet
Better get used to me
Tho mo' money for guns, the mo' homicide
The mo' pussies that run, the mo' I'mma ride
Cause since Poppa died, I was starin' eye to eye
With them gangstas, those niggas you idolize
I was young & blind cutting class wastin' time
Til' my nigga introduced me to that other side
He said listen you plan out what you wanna do
You out thinkin' you grown you got a lot to prove
Ain't nuttin' free in this world
You gotta take it fool, you wanna roll
Good here's a 22
You see them niggas right there
Shoot them
And ever since that day, I've been a shooter

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B.G.]
Oh, I'm a baby gangsta, you name it I done it
You heard the hook nigga, I'm the definition of it
I came my own way, been wildin' since 13
Soon niggas get in line if you wanna mirk me
Let's take it to the streets
Where I started it
Where half the city wanted for murder charges there
I'm dressed in all black
Baseball hat
Gorilla Suit nigga that's what I call that
I never been a rat
And I don't fuck with the lame
I took lost bounce bitch and charged it to the game
Always been the same
I ain't never gon' change
When I'm in beef you know I gotta let my nuts hang
I come from down south, on them back streets
I bet you I'll wack a nigga before you wack me
Nigga go get [?] yeh fuck with me
You know a gangsta and a hustlah is all I'll ever be

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Maino]
Look I got killers around me
Drug dealers around me
Real talk don't bring no bird niggas around me
I get bullet proof love if thugs fuck with me
I act up because the goons run with me
A nigga play he gon' it cause I'mma headshot him
They say I move like Tut before the Feds got him
I'm a gang leader, in a white wife beater
Tattered black flagged up In a two seater
Bitches notice me by the scar, know its me
The four fifth in my coatsleeve, coatsleeve
I've been to jail before
That's what hell is dog
My niggas back and forth like it's a damn resort
This is for my niggas that grind and have pistols on them
Don't play with police we draw pistols on them
The game really fucked up
When they let crooks in
I'm comin' through screamin' BROOKLYN

[Hook]
