[Intro: ItsTheReal]
Yeah

You dumb bitch
You stupid motherfucker
You feel me?
Nah
Nah, you don't feel me
You know why?
Cause you dead, motherfucker
Do you hear me?
Nah
Nah, you don't hear me
You know why?
Cause you dead, motherfucker
That's right, that's what you get for fucking with us
Fuck you, you dead motherfucker
That's what you get for fucking with us and Maino
Now we're gonna talk our shit
Yeah
Not now, but...closer to now
Like now!

[Hook: Eric and Jeff]
You don't want beef wit us
Or our friend Maino!
We bring the streets wit us
Our friend Maino!
We carry heat wit us
Our friend Maino!
You can't compete wit us
Or our friend Maino!

[Verse 1: ItsTheReal]
[E]Got something to say, say it to Maino's face
Dudes wanna trip, Maino will put you in a suitcase
[J] Maino does the dirty work, Spic and Span, Mr. Clean
Knuckle sandwich all day with a hit of Listerine
[E] You don't want to try us, our parents spoiled us rotten
We cry over spilled milk; rest in peace, never forgotten
[J] If we got a problem, yo, he'll solve it
Check out your neck while Maino revolves it
[E] Question Jeff, you're 'bout to learn the hard way
People get nosy, Maino hit 'em with the nasal spray
[J] Welcome to the house of pain, take your shoes off at the door
Maino's got fists of fury, and we've got a couple more
[E] We'll have you eating through a straw cause you's a sucker
Me, Jeff, and Maino, we're one bad motherfucker, for real
[J] Ski mask and boots on, coming back from Aspen
You Mr. Potato Head, Maino get to mashing

[Hook]

[Hook 2]
You don't want beef wit us
Or our friend Maino!
We bring the streets wit us
Our friend Maino!
We carry heat wit us
Our friend Maino!
You can't compete wit us
Go get 'em, Maino!

[Verse 2: Maino]
I don't know the Maino that they talking 'bout
Cause I don't like problems -- I'd rather talk it out
Rather speak to you, so we can squash the beef
I'm not a violent man, and I don't pack heat
I'm a nice guy, I wear glasses now
I'm a different dude, I wouldn't blast you now
And I don't want drama, guess I'm a changed man
Church on every Sunday -- giving praise, man
See, I'm not a thug; let's get it understood
Live in a big house -- I don't rep the hood
And as a matter of fact, they don't want me back
My friends are businessmen, they not selling crack
Wouldn't bust a grape, wouldn't hurt a fly
The shit they rapping 'bout, I'm not that guy
So if you hear this track, please pay no attention
Cause they gon' get me killed for all the things they mention

[Hook]

[Outro: ItsTheReal]
You know, I was doing some thinking. Maybe we should be the bigger people and we should apologize
Yeah. If nothing else, we have manners
When I said, "You put the 'bitch' in 'obituary,' I totally didn't mean that. It was taken out of context
When I said that we were gonna put you in the ground and hope that a tree grows out of it, it was done with the best of intentions
Look, when I said, 'Fuck your life,' I was talking about the cereal. Everyone knows I'm a Cheerios guy
