[Hook]
Drug deals, hood niggas, OGs, young Killers
Convicts, inmates, whale niggas, gorillas
Those the niggas that love me
Those the niggas that love me
Young shooters, weed users, gun boys, brick movers
Club poppin', credit swipin', G-ridin', chrome ruger
Those the niggas that love me
Those the niggas that love me

[Verse 2: Maino]
I don't say a word, these niggas know
No hesitating my killers go
Money, hoes and fine cars
Street nigga turned rap star
Photogenic, windows tinted
Riding dirty, bitches in it
In the kitchen coke whipping
Ya'll talk it my niggas live it
Dealers love me, killers love me
Brooklyn niggas take a bullet for me
I said Brooklyn niggas take a bullet for me
Name ringing, chain swinging
When it's on, bring bring
Certified diamonds gleaming
.45 see the demon
Real niggas only come around me
K.O.B. come and crown me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
One time for a real nigga
Couple kites for my jail niggas
What these young boys trying to be
I'm the poster child for those [?]
Ride with us, mafia, cook niggas
Tilapia, unstoppable, no stopping us
These fake niggas could not be us
Look around me, goons around me
In the jungle gorillas found me
I'm too high for you to down me
I make the news if you fucking doubt me
Those the niggas that love
There's only one man above me
Them young strippers adore me
Those the bitches that love me

[Hook]
