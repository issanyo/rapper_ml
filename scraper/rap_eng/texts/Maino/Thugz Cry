(Hook: Manolo Rose)
Look at my eyes and you can see what pain lookin' like
Look at my eyes and you can see what death lookin' like
I took a loss and bounced back yeah cause I cook it right
My mama ain't raised no sucka
I hope that this'll happen for a gangsta x2
As i'm just wishin' hell upon you pranksta's x2
This is what it sound like when the f***ing thugz cry
And this is what it sound like when the f***ing thugz cry
And this is what a L like when the f***ing thugz cry
When thugz cry
Yeah x3
Let the hammer fly
GO!

(Verse 1: Maino)
Told on me at the felony
Go hard til they sentence me
Strong mind bring real money
Real money bring jealousy
Stay ready they better be
I'm the king they tellin' me
Swear to God i'm prayin' hard
I'll crush all of my enemies
Be a part of this street life
Live fast don't cheat life
In the Telly with 2 b****'s
One yellin' it's skeet night
K.O.Beezy n****'s see me
40 Cal let's squeeze easy
D.O.D next up is Tweezy
I can't leave these streets need me
Better bring your hard hats
We in the club with our gats
Check n****'s like car facts
AR for combat
This is how my thugz cry
Guns up when a thug dies
2 Glocks 2Pac
In the trap thug life

(Hook: Manolo Rose)
Look at my eyes and you can see what pain lookin' like
Look at my eyes and you can see what death lookin' like
I took a loss and bounced back yeah cause I cook it right

I hope that this'll happen for a gangsta x2

(Verse 2: Uncle Murda)
This is what it sound like when the f***ing body drop
Money countin' keep brateing cause I'm countin' all the guap
Just gave my partner life talkin' bout thugz cryin'
Slug slime
Hittin' everybody x2
Got some homies on parole still tryna kill somethin'
Catch ya body left right damn they ain't feel nothin'
Got some shooters outta state still tryna drill somethin'
Got a lawyer on the case brown that a pill comin'
You can look into my eyes you can see i'm with the s***'s
You FaceTime but she ain't answer cause i'm with the b****
This is what it sound like when I drive a Bag-era
So many headshots at his funeral they put a mass error

(Hook: Manolo Rose)
