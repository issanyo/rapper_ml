[Verse]
I'm swagging out the building, swagger on a hundred trillion
A lot of people talk but Lil Skies be chilling
I'm writing rhymes til my hands ain't got no feeling
I been writing dope flows and now these rappers I'm killing
So I don't plan to stop
You'd rather see me at the bottom but I'm at the top
I always told my bros "Homie one day we'll make it"
But we wanna be legendary so forget famous
I told you dudes I hit this mic just like an uppercut
And half of y'all are fake like Nicki Minaj's butt
I try to keep it real but half of y'all are phony
And I normally spend time writing rhymes but that gets lonely
But man these dudes have no clue what hip-hop is
It's not about the drugs, girls, or the money kid
Dog it's about that realness coming from the heart
See these rappers is all talk but they stink like fart
Illuminati getting trapped inside your brain man
Y'all stand tall but sink fast like it's quicksand
I don't understand where we went wrong dog
But you rappers are wood then I'ma saw off
See homie Lil Skies I probably be that man
To take your Tinkerbell but I ain't no Peter Pan
I'm growing up now so I really understand
That I'ma write real hip-hop and I don't need a hand
I love this music but I don't love the rap game
Cause all of you rappers are talking bout the same things
Nobody cares about the girls and we don't need the chains
We just need a little help where we could make a change
But Lil Skies dog I'm lyrical, people say I'm a miracle
Cause I'm making them spiritual
No need to get technical like I was digital
Physically and mentally eating them like it's cereal
Only time will tell who's the best and that's the deally though, for really though
This is how I do
I am chemically combined to this game like an atom to a molecule
People try and challenge but it's nothing to a boss
When I'm on this mic I'm killing rappers like the Holocaust
