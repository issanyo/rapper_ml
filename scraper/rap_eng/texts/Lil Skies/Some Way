[Intro]
Ooh, ayy, ayy, yeah yeah
Ooh, ayy, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Umm, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, I had to go make a way, ayy
I'm on my grind like a skate, ayy
Fuck her, she can't get a date, ayy
I got the cash out a safe, ayy
Look at my life like a race, ayy
I'ma pull up in a Wraith, yeah
I cannot do second place, nah
Ooh, these niggas feelin' some way, ayy
Look in they eyes, see the hate, ayy
I feel like Dex with the K, ayy
Get high and start up my day, ayy
She wanna fuck me today, no
I do not care what they say, no
That's why these hoes in my face, ayy

[Verse 1]
A1, day one, ayy
Trapped off Samsung, ayy
These niggas talk tough, ayy
See me they don't say nothin', ayy
Ballin' like Draymond, ayy
Black hoodies, Akon, ayy
Real niggas, day ones, ayy
Trust none, fear none, ayy
Look, and I got the keys to my city like Future
She said that she love me, she text me like fuck me
I head to the crib and I do her
I fuck with them foreigns, your bitches be borin'
She gave me head like a Medusa
My mom want a house and my bro want a Rari
And I'ma cash out at the jeweler
Ah-what? she wanna go on a date, huh
Gold diamonds in her face, huh
Never had a clean plate, huh
Now a nigga eatin' steak, woah
Livin' life at high stakes, woah
Blue bills, no face, woah
Fuck niggas can't relate, nah

[Chorus]
Ooh, I had to go make a way, ayy
I'm on my grind like a skate, ayy
Fuck her, she can't get a date, ayy
I got the cash out a safe, ayy
Look at my life like a race, ayy
I'ma pull up in a Wraith, yeah
I cannot do second place, nah
Ooh, these niggas feelin' some way, ayy
Look in they eyes, see the hate, ayy
I feel like Dex with the K, ayy
Get high and start up my day, ayy
She wanna fuck me today, no
I do not care what they say, no
That's why these hoes in my face, ayy

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah, it's goin' down
Tell that bitch sit down
Ride a merry go round
I'm smokin' woods in the lounge
Two hoes going crazy
Niggas actors, Pat Swazey
Sippin' lean, feelin' lazy
If you want a show you gotta pay me
Gold Rollies for the team
Fuckin' hoes, never seen
Keep a shooter with the beam
Straight head, she a fiend
This rap shit too easy
She text my phone like she need me
I cut her off 'cause she greedy
I swear these hoes acting needy
Ayy, she gon' roll my kush nigga
Keep it real with me, why you beat around the bush
I just had to flex on 'em, now they all know who we are
Rockstar lifestyle, she wanna come play my guitar, ooh

[Chorus]
I had to go make a way, ayy
I'm on my grind like a skate, ayy
Fuck her, she can't get a date, ayy
I got the cash out a safe, ayy
Look at my life like a race, ayy
I'ma pull up in a Wraith, yeah
I cannot do second place, nah
Ooh, these niggas feelin' some way, ayy
Look in they eyes, see the hate, ayy
I feel like Dex with the K, ayy
Get high and start up my day, ayy
She wanna fuck me today, no
I do not care what they say, no
That's why these hoes in my face, ayy
