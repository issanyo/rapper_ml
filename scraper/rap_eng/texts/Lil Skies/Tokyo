[Verse]
Flexing on these nigga, now I think that I'm Hulk Hogan (yeah)
I don't care about you, bitch the money is my motive (yeah)
She just want attention, say it's easy to expose her (yeah)
I'm all in her pussy, you would think I was a Trojan (yeah)
2016 (yeah) I'm coming for the win
And I smoke a lot of weed, I think it is my medicine
If the cops pull me over, Imma hide the evidence
And the way she gave me top, she was so intelligent
I want hella bands, I want hella fans, I smoke hella grams
I'm just on some different shit, she like the way I hit my dance
I just fucked a foreign hoe, got a few out of state
I can never save these thots, I just gotta say my grace
Call my nigga Rahi, said lets go get it poppin (ooh)
I can never switch up, I remember how I got it (ooh)
I just spread the love, all these hating niggas toxic (ooh)
When you on your grind, you can't let nobody stop it (ooh)
Paradise and a pair of Nikes, shawty very nice
Blue berry ice, she the cocky type, she can't stay the night
Diamonds piss yellow, make it rain like the umbrella
(oh) She say she like my sauce, guess I am a jiggy fella (ooh)
Mind state like Kanye, but I'm on another level (ooh)
Niggas want to be alike, like that shit ain't very clever (ooh)
Plug put me on, now my lifestyle is so better (ooh)
Shawty like my voice, it's the type to make her wetter (ooh)
Tryna disappear and buy a house in Tokyo
Have a closet of designer and a bitch to roll my dope
I don't really need much but my fucking studio
I'm tryna disappear and buy a house in Tokyo

[Refrain]
And I'm tryna disappear and buy a house in Tokyo
Have a closet of designer and a bitch to roll my dope
I don't really need much but my fucking studio
I'm tryna disappear and buy a house in Tokyo
