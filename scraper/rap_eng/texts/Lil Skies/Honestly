[Intro]
Yuh, yuh, yuh, aye
Yuh, yuh, yuh
And I'm, and I'm, and I'm drippin' out the sauce still, woo
Yuh, aye, yuh, woo

[Verse 1]
Aye, I'm a money making motherfucker
I never trust her, I just fuck her, pass her to my brother
You know these hoes ain't loyal, why you always tryna cuff 'em?
And niggas bluffin' no discussion Taydo get to bustin'
Okay gang in this bitch they will get involved
And I just think about this shit and how it all evolved
You know I gotta keep it real and let the fake dissolve
And I ain't worried 'bout these hoes you can have 'em all

[Verse 2]
Okay I had to get my bands up, her hands up, shawty go on and pull your pants up, and stand up
I can give it to you late night, late night
Swim all in you like a great white she tastes right
Oh my god shawty a nudist that booty stupid
Broke her heart like I'm cupid, I've been a nuisance
I'm like Freddy with the Krueger, shine like a jeweler
I want ice on my Medusa, flex on you losers
They like how you so persistent? I'm born to get it
I'm like Jordy on my Pippins please don't forget it
All these niggas be my children I feel like Nikki
She get high off the sticky white bitch named Vicky

[Hook]
I see how I came up, yuh, they didn't think I was for real
I'm just tryna stack a mill I need a house up on the hills
Oh my god, long days, people said I wouldn't make it
Now I'm smokin' on Jamaican, eyes low like I am asian
Oh yeah, they don't understand I had to paint the vision
Momma told me I was trippin', now she see I wasn't kiddin'
I got people sayin' sorry honestly I'm not forgiving
Honestly I've been a great repeat that shit in every sentence

[Verse 3]
I got bitches down to fuck me yeah they ready to go
I got people on my dick because I'm destined to blow
Can't forget when I was down that's why I sip purple rain
Niggas say I switched up, I think I needed a change
And I'm coming for revenge like I'm OVO
Coast to coast smokin' dope with exotic hoes
And I'm only 17 but I'm still the man
Don't fear man, get your bans, you don't need a friend
And yeah I'm tryna go to Texas just to vibe off the energy
Built a lotta enemies I guess it wasn't meant to be
Back on my grimy shit, she just want a wedding ring
I'm the type to lay low then pop out make the fucking scene, nigga
