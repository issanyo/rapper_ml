[Intro: Pollàri]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Pollàri]
One after one I be rolling (I be rolling, yeah)
Can't fuck with these niggas, they be joking (they be joking)
Bitches on my line, I gotta stay focused (gotta stay focused, now)
Only want the money but they know it (but they know it)
One after one I be rolling (I be rolling, yeah)
Can't fuck with these niggas, they be joking (they be joking)
Bitches on my line, I gotta stay focused (gotta stay focused, now)
Only want the money but they know it (but they know it)

[Verse 1: Pollàri]
Open my eyes see that she shining, you blinding
I wrote a grammy when you plying no lying
I know just what you need
I know just what you seen
You open your heart, girl you can follow me
Come to your rescue babe, no matter what they say
I get like ten a day, drink you like lemonade
She know that these niggas, they mad
Know that these niggas, they sad
Baby now I'm so rad
Baby now I'm so rad
I keep that kush in the bag
Put that li'l hoe in the trash
I did it all for the cash
I did it all for the cash
Hot and in love with your fingers (yuh)
Pollàri in love with the digits (yuh)
Now that they shining, you know I'm reclining
When I [?] they taking pictures
Oh my god, it's the first of the month
I get a chance like I'm paying for lunch
Who you know way better than us?
I did it all for the price of one

[Chorus: Pollàri]
One after one I be rolling (I be rolling, yeah)
Can't fuck with these niggas, they be joking (they be joking)
Bitches on my line, I gotta stay focused (gotta stay focused, now)
Only want the money but they know it (but they know it)
One after one I be rolling (I be rolling, yeah)
Can't fuck with these niggas, they be joking (they be joking)
Bitches on my line, I gotta stay focused (gotta stay focused, now)
Only want the money but they know it (but they know it)

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
One after one I be rolling

Bitches on my line, I gotta stay focused (gotta stay focused, now)
Only want the money but they know it (but they know it)
