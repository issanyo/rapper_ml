[Verse 1]:
Ay, ay, ay
Get in my way and try to block me, I'ma show aggression
Slide on your block like Danny Glover with a lethal weapon
I fucked your thot, she gave me top, I guess that's my confession
Got no regrets, I made mistakes, but I learned from my lessons
Trappin' by the stu, villains pull up to the coupe
My car ain't got no roof, thought this shit was bulletproof
I can't feel my face, smokin' on Gorilla Glue
Zoomin' in the coupe, that's the shit I like to do
These is yellow diamonds, shinin' like I'm Pikachu
I'm a boss nigga, get that bag and make the moves
No, I don't like to lose, so I be goin' in, yeah
I'm tryna cop a Benz, yeah, pull up and drop like ten, yeah
You tryna chase the life (what?), well I'm tryna chase the bands, yeah
She wanna fuck with friends, yeah, I got 'em in the trance, yeah

[Chorus]:
Ay, but now they tell me I switched up
Take this Backwood to the face, then grab my cup
Shorty says she comin' through, she on her way to fuck
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ay, I stack it up, can't get enough
Seen your shorty with you, she look at me and she blushed
I'm a jiggy nigga, I don't take her out for lunch
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ay, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ay, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Not a lot of love

[Drop]:
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Not a lot of love

[Verse 2]:
Rollin' in the coupe and she was rollin' off the drugs
Lookin' for the one, girl, you know that I'm the plug
I be booted up with my shooters in the truck
Ay, and broski keep it and it's tucked
Nigga talkin' 'bout it, but he never runnin' up
Put this shit in motion, so I'm never stayin' stuck
Don't be actin' starstruck every time they show you love

[Chorus]:
Ay, but now they tell me I switched up
Take this Backwood to the face, then grab my cup
Shorty say she comin' through, she on her way to fuck
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ay, I stack it up, can't get enough
Seen your shorty with you, she look at me and she blushed
I'm a jiggy nigga, I don't take her out for lunch
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ay, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ay, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love

[Drop]:
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Love, Love, Love
