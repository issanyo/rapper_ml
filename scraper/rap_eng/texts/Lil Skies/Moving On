[Chorus: Global Dan]
It's only me up at the top
And my homies all along
When I pull up in that drop
Shawty coming on strong when I'm on
Don't know why you want me when I'm moving on
Hoe, you only want me 'cause my money long

[Verse 1: Global Dan]
Now I'm gone
You was wrong
I was right
Now I'm on
On the run
To the funds
Lot of smoke
In my lungs
Fucking this bad lil bitch, aye
Put lil bitch on top, aye
Let her ride on my dick, aye
Tell lil bitch don't stop, aye
Now they're all on my shit, aye
All these lil bitches wanna fuck, aye
Now they're all on my shit, aye
All these lil bitches wanna flock, yah
Look at my floss, aye
Shawty wanna fuck with a boss
It don't really matter 'bout the cost
I'ma get it, I'ma do what I want
When I pull up in a brand new foreign
And I got a bad bitty in the front
Now that I'm getting the money they tell me they love me
But really they just wanna stunt
No one, nobody but me and my homies
They keep it 100 with me from the jump
I'ma keep running, arriba
I'm feeling like Khalifa with all of this weed in my blunt
Love to take flight, I'ma leave one day
I just wanna get paid
I'ma get that bag
Then I'm on my way

[Chorus: Global Dan]
It's only me up at the top
And my homies all along
When I pull up in that drop
Shawty coming out strong when I'm on
Don't know why you want me when I'm moving on
Hoe, you only want me 'cause my money long

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
Girl you only want me 'cause my money long
Baby girl addicted, she got my name on her thong
I'ma fuck you good then I'ma go and make a song
Take hits out the bong, she coughing up her lung
You the freaky type, you gon' lick it with your tongue
She give me fallatio, I make her tonsils numb
I'm a nasty nigga, baby tell me when you cum
Hit it from the back, I pull your hair so you can't run
Boss up, boss up, yeah
On my enemies
Know they talk 'bout us
But they not like we
And I'm up right now
Flex like Mr. T
When I was down bad
Were you there for me?
Lil Skies and Global Dan, aye
Put your bitch in a trance, aye
And I ain't get her off the Xans
And she was feeling my pants
She tried to reach for my bands
Baby girl just a fan
I don't trust her 'cause I can't
Baby girl just a fan

[Chorus: Global Dan]
It's only me up at the top
And my homies all along
When I pull up in that drop
Shawty coming out strong when I'm on
Don't know why you want me when I'm moving on
Hoe, you only want me 'cause my money long
