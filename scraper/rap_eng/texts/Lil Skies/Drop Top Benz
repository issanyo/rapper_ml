[Intro: Lil Skies]
Drop top Benz
Drop top Benz
Drop top Benz
We pulled up in a drop top Benz

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Drop top Benz
Pull up in a foreign, it's just me and all her friends
She wanna make a movie so I grabbed the camera lens
All I spend is bands, models up in France
Shake your money maker girl, you know you gotta twerk it
Throw a couple bands up, watch it hit the surface
We gon' make the world shake, do it with a purpose
Drop top Benz, me and all her friends

[Verse: Lil Gnar]
Whip the Panamera, you niggas can't stand us
Diamonds they be dripping, my left wrist look like Atlantis
Made it out the bottom, put that on my momma
It's a rockstar party, come and pop a pill bitch
Got some neck up in the foreign, had to hit the killswitch
Lot of young niggas and you know we came to kill shit
Baby girl stop whining, put that molly on your tongue
Never touched a hundred bands, how you judging up
She just wanna eat and fuck but I cannot be cuffed
Getting money everyday that be my mission
Run it up so catch me flexing in the picture
In the picture
G Wagon with the red cut you can't get it inside
Drop top Benz got your bitch like oh my god
Off the gas and I'm seeing stars
Bust down, that's a Audemars

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Drop top Benz
Pull up in a foreign, it's just me and all her friends
She wanna make a movie so I grabbed the camera lens
All I spend is bands, models up in France
Shake your money maker girl, you know you gotta twerk it
Throw a couple bands up, watch it hit the surface
We gon' make the world shake, do it with a purpose
Drop top Benz, me and all her friends
