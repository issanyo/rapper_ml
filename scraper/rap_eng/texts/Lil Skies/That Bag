[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay, woah
Hey, ay, ay

[Hook]
Count my cash then I dip off
I'm just in my own trance like I'm criss cross
I just fucked a foreign bitch wearing lip gloss
She just wanna be a boss like she Rick Ross
Ima go and get that bag, why they pissed off?

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, shorty you ain't gotta lie to me
Must be doing something right, see all my enemies
I be turnt up on these niggas like I'm Mr. T
All my bitches stay on fleek, they don't need maybelline
Backwoods look like fingers that's that gasoline
You hit it once boy I promise gon' be hard to breath
Bad bitch, fuck me good don't do wedding rings
And that's my baby, you fuck with her then you fuck with me
I hit a lick with my bitch, she with anything
Raf Simons, Rick Owen, she a fashion queen
I don't judge her 'cause i know some things just meant to be
And she drink henny out the bottle, that's a remedy
Purple sprite, baby you know i'm in slow mo
Oh she bounced up on my dick like a pogo
So you know I had to beat it like a bongo
Call me sylvester, in that pussy I go rambo

[Pre-hook]
Outsiders catch the wave, watch out for the tides
Catched a vibe, took some time, now we in the light
Me and my baby chasing money got no time to cry
They be jealous, we don't care, we just [?]

[Hook]
Count my cash then i dip off
I'm just in my own trance like I'm criss cross
I just fucked a foreign bitch wearing lip gloss
She just wanna be a boss like she Rick Ross
Ima go and get that bag, why they pissed off?

[Verse 2]
Ooh, diamonds shining like a chandelier
I ain't ever really worried i don't show no fear
Bad bitch taking trips out the MIA
I think I like her, I don't trust her, I went MIA
All these plays, winning chips, that's that Frito-Lay
And Ima ball, never fall we gon' make a wave
I pull up on a nigga like i got some shit to say
And we like bands, fuck a friend they get in the way
True like religion, see no difference, where my competition
I had to hustle off the muscle just to say i'm livin'
Momma said it's green lights, so its time to get it
Bad decisions, fuck opinions why your boy so vivid
Not with the bullshit, like a nigga name with Scottie Pippen
I cut you off, baby I don't do no reminiscing
Oh you know she gonna have this shit on repeat
I feel like john cena you can't even see me

[Pre-Hook]
Outsiders catch the wave, watch out for the tides
Took some time, caught the vibe, now we in the light
Me and my baby chasing money got no time to cry
They be hating 'cause they see we out here on the rise

[Hook]
I'm just in my own trance like i'm criss cross
I just fucked a foreign bitch wearing lip gloss
She just wanna be a boss like she Rick Ross
Imma go and get that bag, why they pissed off?
