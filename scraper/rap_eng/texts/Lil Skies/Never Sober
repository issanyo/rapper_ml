Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse 1]
I don't even need to flex
Your bitch gon’ need some rest
Hit her with she free for sex
Yeah I'm still balling out my set
All of these diamonds wet
You get no respect
You niggas on my head

[Chorus]
I don't need no lies
That’s why I'm never sober
I don't wanna conversate unless you comin' over
I let the money elevate
It's better with my soldiers
She poppin' like a toaster
