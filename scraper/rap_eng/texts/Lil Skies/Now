[Intro]
Cito

[Chorus: Suigeneris]
Stackin' my cheddar, sippin' on lean
Bitches on me now (We up)
Pushin' the gas, pushin' the gas
I'm on the scene now (Skrrt)
I'm gettin' money, I'm gettin' money
They lookin' at me now
They lookin' at me now
They lookin' at me now
Stackin' my cheddar, sippin' on lean
Bitches on me now (We up)
Pushin' the gas, pushin' the gas
I'm on the scene now (Skrrt)
I'm gettin' money, I'm gettin' money
They lookin' at me now
They lookin' at me now
They lookin' at me now

[Verse 1: Suigeneris]
Yeah they be lookin' at me (Yeah)
While I be stackin' the cheese (Yeah)
Baby girl, pass me the green (Yeah)
Get me as high as can be (Yeah)
I don't want up in the trees (Yeah)
I wanna be up in the sky (Yeah)
Up in the clouds, I'ma fly (Yeah)
High off the Percs, on my life
High off the Percs, on my life
High off the Percs, on my life
High off the Percs, on my life
High off the Percs, on my life
High off the Percs, on my life
High off the Percs, on my life
High off the Percs, on my life

[Chorus: Suigeneris]
Stackin' my cheddar, sippin' on lean
Bitches on me now (We up)
Pushin' the gas, pushin' the gas
I'm on the scene now (Skrrt)
I'm gettin' money, I'm gettin' money
They lookin' at me now
They lookin' at me now
They lookin' at me now
Stackin' my cheddar, sippin' on lean
Bitches on me now (We up)
Pushin' the gas, pushin' the gas
I'm on the scene now (Skrrt)
I'm gettin' money, I'm gettin' money
They lookin' at me now
They lookin' at me now
They lookin' at me now

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
Ayy, ayy
When I was down bad with no one to call
My plug on the speed dial
I live my life fast, my foot on the gas
I live what I dream now
And you mad 'cause I brag
I go get the bag, they know I'm a cash cow
Fuck my haters, I ball out
Got the money, don't need the clout
Woah, woah, smokin' gas by the O, O
I got the smoke all in my clothes
This the life I chose, bitches takin' off their clothes
And want me to take them home
Right after all of my shows

[Chorus: Suigeneris]
Stackin' my cheddar, sippin' on lean
Bitches on me now (We up)
Pushin' the gas, pushin' the gas
I'm on the scene now (Skrrt)
I'm gettin' money, I'm gettin' money
They lookin' at me now
They lookin' at me now
They lookin' at me now
Stackin' my cheddar, sippin' on lean
Bitches on me now (We up)
Pushin' the gas, pushin' the gas
I'm on the scene now (Skrrt)
I'm gettin' money, I'm gettin' money
They lookin' at me now
They lookin' at me now
They lookin' at me now
