[Intro: Lil Skies]
Out on my balcony, yeah, ayy
Out on my balcony, yeah, ayy
Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
I know, and I know
I know, and I know why
I'm on my balcony
Jump off a balcony
Get on a balcony
Jump off the balcony

[Bridge: Sprite Lee]
You had a sign bitch
I had to buy it
I know a lame nigga when I one
And your pockets are on my list
I'm on my balcony, you ain't invited
I am the captain now, you just a pirate

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
I had to lay low
Stack up my pesos
I gotta watch out
They in the raincoats
They want a casualty
This ain't the end of me
I got the remedy
Cook like a recipie
Walk on a tightrope
Sip lean and die slow
My pockets line dough
My wine like Michael
Lay low and sip my tea
She wanna fuck on me
I let her suck my D
She gon' remember me

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
I know, and I know
I know, and I know why
I'm on my balcony
Jump off a balcony
Get on a balcony
Jump off the balcony

[Verse 2: Sprite Lee & Lil Skies]
I put my coupe in neutral when I drop top
She won't leave me lone, I still like to bump up
I cut that bitch off, I'm just like a crop top
I shut the lanes out whenever I hotbox
Don't be afraid of heights
Are you the savage type
Don't ever tell me lies
Just let me catch a vibe
Don't know what's wrong with me
Something got into me
They say I'm hard to read
Friends turn to enemies

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
I know, and I know
I know, and I know why
I'm on my balcony
Jump off a balcony
Get on a balcony
Jump off the balcony
I know
