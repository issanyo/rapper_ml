[Intro]
Woah-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Menoh)
Woah-oh, oh
Ayy

[Chorus]
Now they salty
See me winnin', now they wanna stop me
Came from nothin', now we fuckin' flossin'
I feel great, these people think I'm awesome
Lil baby, why you fraudin'
Plant my seed, watch me grow a garden
Save your breath, I don't do the arguin'
We done came up, we worked the hardest
Why you salty?
See me winnin', now they wanna stop me
Came from nothin', now we fuckin' flossin'
I feel great, these people think I'm awesome

[Verse 1]
Run away, from all the pain
I tried so hard to change my ways, think I'm insane
She rollin' up my Mary Jane, she in love with me
And I'm rollin' off an Addy pill, think this controllin' me
And they said I wouldn't be shit, but I'm here
And you thought that I was up now, just wait 'til next year
I got people sendin' threats, I can never show no fear
Smoke 'em like a cigarette, see that smoke when I appear

[Chorus]
Now they salty
See me winnin', now they wanna stop me
Came from nothin', now we fuckin' flossin'
I feel great, these people think I'm awesome
Lil baby, why you fraudin'
Plant my seed, watch me grow a garden
Save your breath, I don't do the arguin'
We done came up, we worked the hardest
Why you salty?
See me winnin', now they wanna stop me
Came from nothin', now we fuckin' flossin'
I feel great, these people think I'm awesome

[Verse 2]
I put my back against the wall and just scream, "Fuck 'em all"
Now that I'm up they like to call and try to get involved
I look my shorty in the eyes like, "I can't do you wrong"
You ride for me, I ride for you, that's how we get along
I see it in your face, yeah, got no time for the basic
I wish they could see it how I see it, but I'm famous
You can have my old swag 'cause every day I change it
I can't take no L's, I'm destined for greatness

[Chorus]
Now they salty
See me winnin', now they wanna stop me
Came from nothin', now we fuckin' flossin'
I feel great, these people think I'm awesome
Lil baby, why you fraudin'
Plant my seed, watch me grow a garden
Save your breath, I don't do the arguin'
We done came up, we worked the hardest
Why you salty?
See me winnin', now they wanna stop me
Came from nothin', now we fuckin' flossin'
I feel great, these people think I'm awesome
