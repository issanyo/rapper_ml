[Intro]
Ayy, she said she wanna roll, high
Ayy, roll one and touch the sky
What a lie
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
I live a dark life, I don't let people in
They say I smoke too much, but this my medicine
Don't get the wrong impression, I'm 'bout my presidents
Rockstar my life, look at the evidence
And would you shoot for me? 'Cause I would kill for you
I like the way you dance, you got no point to prove
I shine just like a jewel, my baby that's my boo
We both is off the goop and swerving in my Coupe

[Verse 1]
Depression settin' in, so grab my medicine
The cops lookin' for it, I hide the evidence
Bitch, I'm intelligent, they say I'm heaven sent
Life feel like Hell on earth, I fly high like a blimp
Girl, why you fuck with him? You know that nigga sell
He said he got a bag, that boy is not a pill
All of my niggas up, I did this for my team
Bitch, I'm a young boss, didn't have anything
I'm tryna own a house, you tryna own a chain
Omert√† still the code, I won't tell on my gang
I used to dream about it, made it reality
And you are not my friend, 'cause back then you was doubtin' me

[Chorus]
I live a dark life, I don't let people in
They say I smoke too much, but this my medicine
Don't get the wrong impression, I'm 'bout my presidents
Rockstar my life, look at the evidence
And would you shoot for me? 'Cause I would kill for you
I like the way you dance, you got no point to prove
I shine just like a jewel, my baby that's my boo
We both is off the goop and swerving in my Coupe

[Verse 2]
Lil baby fuck me good, I took her to my hood
I wish that nigga would, would throw him in the woods
My life a scary movie, I never catch a break
How you gon' help me out, then throw it in my face?
This world's a different place, my mind is like a race
I'm always on the go, I gotta let you know
That I'm a lonely nigga, no, I don't need a hoe
I only need my dough, I'm talkin' bankroll
All of these bitches fuckin', all of these niggas lame
I can't fall victim to it, I'm in a different lane
You wanna see me fail, don't wanna see me change
It's funny how it works, now you are stuck in pain

[Chorus]
I live a dark life, I don't let people in
They say I smoke too much, but this my medicine
Don't get the wrong impression, I'm 'bout my presidents
Rockstar my life, look at the evidence
And would you shoot for me? 'Cause I would kill for you
I like the way you dance, you got no point to prove
I shine just like a jewel, my baby that's my boo
We both is off the goop and swerving in my Coupe

[Outro]
Swervin', swervin', swervin', swervin'
Swervin', swervin', swervin', swervin'
Swervin', swervin', swervin', swervin'
