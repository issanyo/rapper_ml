[Intro: Lil Skies]
CashMoneyAP
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Get in my way and try to block me, I'ma show aggression
Slide on your block like Danny Glover with a lethal weapon
I fucked your thot, she gave me top, I guess that's my confession
Got no regrets, I made mistakes, but I learned from my lessons
Trappin' by the stu, villains pull up to the coupe
My car ain't got no roof, thought this shit was bulletproof
I can't feel my face, smokin' on Gorilla Glue
Zoomin' in the coupe, that's the shit I like to do
These is yellow diamonds, shinin' like I'm Pikachu
I'm a boss nigga, get that bag and make the moves
No, I don't like to lose, so I be goin' in, yeah
I'm tryna cop a Benz, yeah, pull up and drop like ten, yeah
You tryna chase the life (what?) well I'm tryna chase the bands, yeah
She wanna fuck with friends, yeah, I got 'em in the trance, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Mckay]
Ayy, but now they tell me I switched up
Take this Backwood to the face, then grab my cup
Shawty say she comin' through, she on the way to fuck
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, I stack it up, can't get enough
Seen your shawty with you, she look at me and she blush
I'm a jiggy nigga, I don't take her out for lunch
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love

[Verse 2: Mckay]
I pull out the skrt
All em hoes start pulling down they skirt
Young nigga balling, yeah the nigga came down from the dirt
Ouu eh, sauce it out
Not too much
Gucci on my feet
Automatic we don’t need no clutch
Im a g both sides like gucci
My coke dope like zoocci
Why u think she smoochy
She suck on my lambronucci
Rain rain go away
I’ll see u another day
I don’t need you melting this ice I got on my wrist today
What u gotta say
I got it 'cause I pray
All this ice on me, like a nigga just got shot with a freeze ray (splash)
Droptop wop like touche ayy
You still on a railway
Was gon leave ur shawty for u but she don’t got

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Mckay]
Not a lot of love
Ayy, I stack it up, can't get enough
Seen your shawty with you, she look at me and she blush
I'm a jiggy nigga, I don't take her out for lunch
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love

[Outro: Mckay]
Not a lot of luh uh uh
