[Intro: Lil Skies]
Yeah, SKG
D-2-double R
And it goes like...

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Back on the mic, dog you know that I'ma keep it real
With dope flows, it's Lil Skies and Dirrty Phil
Filthy dirty entertainment dog our bars kill
I gotta say I'm high on life and I don't need a pill
I go crazy, it seems lazy, I get gravy
Wherever the money and dunny my whole team's shady
Your girl loves us because our swag is so wavy
Being king ain't that hard, you just gotta work daily
My team's in the building when your team's outside
Me and Phil we in the cut like Peroxide
The most dopest on the mic who don't get recognize
But we keep it real inside, eating you rappers alive
I go hard, money's always been my object
All these rappers broke like elevators in the projects
Okay this is how I feel when I go insane
Burning fire using flame
Turn that beats up in my brain

[Hook: Lil Skies]
First off I got a flow to recite
I be the dopest on the beat and the sickest on the mic
With the time that I invest I promise to do my best
And they couldn't step to me cause I put the flow to rest, get 'em
First off I got a flow to recite
I be the dopest on the beat and the sickest on the mic
With the time that I invest I promise to do my best
And they couldn't step to me cause I put the flow to rest, get 'em

[Verse 2: Dirrty Phil]
What they talk about, son I said I been the sickest
I eat these rappers up, mm mm delicious
You know the deal'y, it's Philly Philly and Lil Skies
Dopest on the mic and these other rappers are suicide
Man how we go and do this
So much swag that I don't know what to do with
Really though, buffet  flow and reservations
My mind's waiting while you're waiting, better find yourself some patience
Just face it, i'm blazing may cause incineration
True ain't it? That statement, the top spot I'ma take it
And even mention the fact
To when it comes to you rap dudes, you just straight wack
So go ahead, just convince yourself that you hot
When I got a million other people saying that you not
I got that, mic check 1, 2
I giggity-giggity-get it boy, how bout you, huh?

[Hook: Lil Skies]
First off I got a flow to recite
I be the dopest on the beat and the sickest on the mic
With the time that I invest I promise to do my best
And they couldn't step to me cause I put the flow to rest, get 'em
First off I got a flow to recite
I be the dopest on the beat and the sickest on the mic
With the time that I invest I promise to do my best
And they couldn't step to me cause I put the flow to rest, get 'em

[Outro: Dirrty Phil]
Ha, Lil Skies, Dirrty Phil
Yeah

[Hook: Lil Skies]
First off I got a flow to recite
I be the dopest on the beat and the sickest on the mic
With the time that I invest I promise to do my best
And they couldn't step to me cause I put the flow to rest, get 'em
First off I got a flow to recite
I be the dopest on the beat and the sickest on the mic
With the time that I invest I promise to do my best
And they couldn't step to me cause I put the flow to rest, get 'em
