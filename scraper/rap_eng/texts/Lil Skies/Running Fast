[Intro]
I know I'm higher than a bitch, I can't even front
But I ain't never had shit, that's why I like to stunt
I know that nigga hating on me, this ain't what he want
I know he tryna knock me out because I'm Number 1

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm ballin on these niggas, Jordan when I dunk
She popped a perc and sipped my lean, she thought she was drunk
My niggas savage, riding with the chopper in the trunk
I Barry Bonds that pussy you know I don't ever bunt
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I need that work, I need that bag, give me my fucking check

[Verse 1]
I'm bout to break the bank
I make the trap jump
I'm rollin up the skunk
Your boyfriend is a bum
He say he need that work
Like pull up what's your order
I save it like a hoarder
Then go right to the border
My bitch a dime piece
Yo bitch a three piece
My niggas sellin piece
Y'all fuck with kill piece
Remember being broke
They took me as a joke
Now treat me like the pope
My life's so fucking dope
Bitch I came up, I don't flex for the Gram
Boy I ain't hiding you know who I am
Niggas be talking I don't give a damn
I text her the ??? I feel like Uncle Sam
Bro she like Curry, that 30 don't jam
I got it back now it's all in my hands
Stayed on my toes I ain't switch on my mans
Kill em, be humble and stick to the plan
I'm in the cut, I don't fuck with the VIP
These females ain't loyal, they always on dicks
Stay in the job, I can't be in the mix
They want me to fail but instead I took risks
Look at me now like I'm making them sick
Fuck all the diamonds, I shine regardless
I got the vision, yes I'm an artist
I tell em pull up cause we got the bargain

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm ballin on these niggas, Jordan when I dunk
She popped a perc and sipped my lean, she thought she was drunk
My niggas savage, riding with the chopper in the trunk
I Barry Bonds that pussy you know I don't ever bunt
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I need that work, I need that bag, give me my fucking check

[Verse 2]
That nigga talking, I know he ain't real
Say he won't switch, bet he will for the deal
Work my ass off till my hands touch a mil
Rollin up dope, getting high for the thrill
Gave her the D now she all in her feels
Hitting my phone all the time cannot chill
I do not love you, ain't paying ya bills
She want some clout but I ain't Dr. Phil
We got in late when we came in the door
Hoes in the couch money all in the floor
Ain't running out keep the bag in galore
I shine like a star in the clouds where I soar
Funny thing is I was just by the store
Trapping with bro making plays to get more
Now I'm on flights taking trips to explore
Give me two years and I'm going on tour
It's all we got, bitch you know what it is
Now I'm the man you can't call me a kid
No looking back on the shit that I did
Hitting them licks, laying low from the pigs
Rolling up gas drinking lean like i'm sick
Bro trappin hard making plays out the whip
I'm in the studio making these hits
Chasing my dreams while they sit back and wish
Nigga you know what it is (Woah)
Nigga you know what it ain't
And these niggas ain't felt all my pain
Tell that nigga just stay in his lane
Smoking gas and it's smelling like dank
And my shooters pull up in a tank
And she love me, I'm fresh out the bank
I can't save you, girl I ain't no saint

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm ballin on these niggas, Jordan when I dunk
She popped a perc and sipped my lean, she thought she was drunk
My niggas savage, riding with the chopper in the trunk
I Barry Bonds that pussy you know I don't ever bunt
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I need that work, I need that bag, give me my fucking check
