[Intro]
Ayy, ayy
This that shit like
This that shit like where you just talk your shit like... haha
Go 'head O
Ayy, I told them niggas like, look...
Danny, I see you

[Chorus]
Ayy, ayy, I need 20 for a verse, I need 40 for a show
I got bitches gettin' naked, throwin' money on the floor
Big Patek bust down, pussy hatin' 'cause he broke
I ain't never played the bench, I'm in the game and that's for sure
Claustrophobic, dropped the top, I had to switch lanes (skrrt)
My bitch is crazy, in her purse, she keep a switchblade
I'm out of town, still wear the chain like I'm Johnny Dang
I make it rain in your city, bring the world rage

[Verse 1]
Lifestyle on 300, Sparta's how we comin' (we comin')
Loverboy like I'm McLovin, I got bitches in London
You gon' take a chance and get nothin', niggas fake and be frontin' (they fake)
Whole crowd lit, fist-pumpin', on the stage, I'm jumpin' (jump, jump)
I get cash in abundance, know I made it from my grind
I was waitin' patiently, I knew this shit would take some time
She be sniffin' too much coco, she can't read between the lines
Fell in love with all the hype, now she don't wanna go outside
I bust down the wrist, now my time is full of ice
I bust up my clique, now my niggas livin' life
And you are full of shit if you think I would take advice
You were doin' all the wrong to make sure I was never right

[Chorus]
Ayy, ayy, I need 20 for a verse, I need 40 for a show
I got bitches gettin' naked, throwin' money on the floor
Big Patek bust down, pussy hatin' 'cause he broke
I ain't never played the bench, I'm in the game and that's for sure
Claustrophobic, dropped the top, I had to switch lanes (skrrt)
My bitch is crazy, in her purse, she keep a switchblade
I'm out of town, still wear the chain like I'm Johnny Dang
I make it rain in your city, bring the world rage

[Verse 2]
Ayy, and I can't be tamed, put this shit on replay (replay)
Run her hand all through my braids, she know I'm the new wave (the wave)
Lately I've been on this chase, dark shades, Blu-Ray (Blu-Ray)
You will never take up my space, I don't care what you say (you say)
I had to run it up
Don't think that you've done enough, I blew up like Mrs. Puff
Now they all wanna fuck with us, and these girls fall in love with us
Like no, no, no, no, no
I gotta let you go, go, go, go, go, for real
