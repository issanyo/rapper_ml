[Intro]
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
[?]
Let me spit that shit
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Drug dealers, slug pillers, and young niggas
Sixteen in a world full of cold killers
Times are hard, moms stressing, the bills are due
We have problems with niggas who hated on my crew
Chuck Taylors and hookah pens with water vapor
Dress like a skater but smoking mics like a doobie paper
Ain't got no time for the bullshit so I let it fly
Family wanna see me go far so they yelling "Kie"
Sometimes I feel like I'm really fucking up
Then I fall back in my ways, just really depressed as fuck
Every day I wake up with a vision in my head
Tryna get my life right, I ain't worried bout the bread
It's like nowadays all I wanna do is write
And since I'm on now niggas really tryna fight
It's funny how you get cake and niggas wanna slice
Spend nights with my niggas steady rolling dice
And I say...

[Chorus]
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
And I'm just really working, I'm just really working
I'm just really working, and I'm fucking hurting
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
And I'm just really working, I'm just really working
I'm just really working, and I'm fucking hurting

[Verse 2]
See I just can't live my life like this
That's when I wake up in the morning and I write this shit
These girls on my D cause they love the life I live
Radio shows and videos, I'm not that big
My fan base growing every day
Girls sending me nudies and I ain't even saying hey
It's like damn this is the life you get when you live this way
Niggas pull up on your side with that gun, don't play
It's crazy, I'm just so focused right now so take me seriously
Keep my head up in the clouds, there ain't no fear in me
God put me on this earth to spit this shit lyrically
Heart full of gold, music's really in my destiny
Lil Skies I'm a young legend
Praying to the lord on my knees to the reverend
I really wouldn't reckon, watch where you steppin'
Niggas tryna make hits but forgot the message
So I say...

[Chorus]
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
And I'm just really working, I'm just really working
I'm just really working, and I'm fucking hurting
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
And I'm just really working, I'm just really working
I'm just really working, and I'm fucking hurting
