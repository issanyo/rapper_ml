[Chorus]
Yeah, Playboi Shawtey
All alone in my room, and she getting naughty
Call my phone if you need to talk to somebody
And I know that my soul ain't for everybody
Yeah, tell me lies and don't say you sorry
Take it off when you dance, let me feel your body
I know you all for the bands when you in the party
You got a thirty in your hand, chase it with Bacardi
Yeah, Playboi Shawtey
All alone in my room, and she getting naughty
Call my phone if you need to talk to somebody
And I know that my soul ain't for everybody
Yeah, tell me lies and don't say you sorry
Take it off when you dance, let me feel your body
I know you all for the bands when you in the party
You got a thirty in your hand, chase it with Bacardi

[Verse]
Yeah, ooh
We lit in the party
I smoke a woods with your bitch
Cooling in the lobby
You see the grind, put in time
This shit never stopping
I watch my spine all the time 'cause these niggas plotting
Yeah, these bitches watching
The clock ticking and tocking
I like the way she drop it
And she let me milly-rock it
We swerving in the rocket
My bitch is too exotic
She hold her own pockets, money like ten wallets
Will you remember me, or will you let me go?
If I was 'bout to die, then would you let it blow?
This is the life I chose, can't ever trust a ho
'Cause pain is all I know
So you gon' have to go
'Cause I need all the dough
And she got all the snow
I see it on her nose
She mad she got exposed
Life of a dark rose
Don't ever hide the truth
How would I tell her different, if I was feeling you?
If I was feeling you
How would I tell her different, if I was feeling you?
If I was feeling different, how would I tell her different, if I was feeling you?

[Chorus]
Yeah, Playboi Shawtey
All alone in my room, and she getting naughty
Call my phone if you need to talk to somebody
And I know that my soul ain't for everybody
Yeah, tell me lies and don't say you sorry
Take it off when you dance, let me feel your body
I know you all for the bands when you in the party
You got a thirty in your hand, chase it with Bacardi
Yeah, Playboi Shawtey
All alone in my room, and she getting naughty
Call my phone if you need to talk to somebody
And I know that my soul ain't for everybody
Yeah, tell me lies and don't say you sorry
Take it off when you dance, let me feel your body
I know you all for the bands when you in the party
You got a thirty in your hand, chase it with Bacardi
