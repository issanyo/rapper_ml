[Hook]
I'm at the bottom, I'm working so hard by my lonely
I look at these niggas then laugh in they face 'cause they phoney, yeah
Stressing on nothing, don't think that I know where I'm going
I saw that vision, they mad they don't like what I'm doing, yeah
I'm at the bottom, I'm working so hard by my lonely
I look at these niggas then laugh in they face 'cause they phoney, yeah
Stressing on nothing, don't think that I know where I'm going
I saw that vision, they mad they don't like what I'm doing, yeah

[Verse 1]
Practice make perfect, thank God that I'm working
One thing's for certain, I'm living and learning
While hurting, just breaking my curses
I'm fighting my demons for reasons believe in
My life always changing like seasons
See me, I be scheming, y'all feinding
I'm sorry I'm dreaming, these goals I'm achieving
Reaching my goals
People be changing, I hate when they fold
Turn 17 now I feel like I'm old
Won't go for nothing, don't care what I'm told
I needed time, I don't do drugs
Where is the weed, Ma with some thugs
Got shooters with me, busting them slugs
I wanted peace, but they don't show love
One time

[Pre-Hook]
One time for my city, hold up
Two times for my boys, hold up
Middle fingers to you fuck niggas, hold up
Y'all ain't making noise, hold up
No bitch niggas riding with me
No bitch niggas riding with me
How you claiming that you so real, nah
When you only keep shit 50

I'm at the bottom, I'm working so hard by my lonely
I look at these niggas then laugh in they face 'cause they phoney, yeah
Stressing on nothing, don't think that I know where I'm going
I saw that vision, they mad they don't like what I'm doing, yeah

[Verse 2]
Ghost face nigga, I ain't talking killer
Smoke and nightmares like its MJ Thriller
She gon get freaky when I take her to the villa
Stuck up in my ways, I'm just tryna get paid
Looking back at my life, never had it made
Clean cut dude, smoking cigs in the shade
Got a clean fade now I'm always getting laid
Niggas getting jealous, I'm just getting money
Girls hit my phone while my dick up in they tummy
Step my game up, now a nigga ain't bummy
Is you gon hate me or is you gon love me?
I couldn't change
My dad acting like my manager, nothing's the same
I wish he could see the rain from all of my pain
Lost more than we gain, I'm in another lane
It is what it is, promise I'm doing my thing

[Pre-Hook]
One time for my city, hold up
Two times for my boys, hold up
No times for you fuck niggas, hold up
Y'all ain't making noise, hold up
No bitch niggas riding with me
No bitch niggas riding with me
How you claiming that you so real, yeah
When you only keep shit 50
