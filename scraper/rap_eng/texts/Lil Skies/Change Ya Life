[Verse 1]
Aye
Niggas out here talking crazy
All that talking, never phase me
Might fade to black like Jay Z
Might pull up in a new coupe with a white girl named daisy
Yeah, I came up from nothing, nigga
Made something, nigga
It's amazing, yeah
We goin' at it again
Fucking her and her friends
I did that shit with my mans
And this shit ain't part of the plan, yeah
I got the fans from Japan
Kicking shit, no Jackie Chan
I got the pounds for the land
Flip it up, and watch how I stand, yeah

[Verse 2]
I got the word from my OG
Don't be talking because niggas be police
They gon' judge me and act like they know me
But I know that these people be phony
I was stuck and they left me by my lonely
They was laughing, I was never joking
Driving fast in the coupe and i'm going
Rolling OG and Kali and smokey, yeah
I gotta know if it's real
Cause all of these people be lying
And I see that shit as defiance
And this shit is not rocket science
I answer my haters with silence
Cause this shit could end up in violence
These niggas be talking and wildin'
Get this money and go buy an island
Mama told me she want all italian
Ima' get and buy medallions
Never changing for money and wild shit
Never fold on my bros on the pilots
Swerving fast in the coupe, I got mileage
Remember days when I wish that I was poppin'
I'm smoking gas in the tropics
They can try me, this shit never stopping
You wanna know what it's like
When I was not taking advice
Nigga I put in time for this life
If you trying, bro, aim with the pipe, bang
She wanna stay for the night
I put the henney on ice
This shawty just cut out the lights
And I know she knows what we both like
Not an act of these niggas, we spy
Get that bag and I go for a hike
If you try me', we puttin' up fights
Fuck nigga, we hungry like mike
Don't fold when you hit that light
Please turn when you make that right
She's cold her heart, like ice
One night might change her life, ya

[Outro]
Aye
Ou, oh one night might change your life yeah, girl
Ou, oh one night might change your life yeah, aye
Ou, oh one night might change your life , girl
Aye
Oh
