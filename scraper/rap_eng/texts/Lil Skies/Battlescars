[Intro : Lil Skies]
Ahhh yuh they know who we are
They know we are ayy

[Chorus : Lil Skies]
Yuh they know who we are
I can't trust that girl I'm just gon break her heart
Driving in my whip like it's a stolen car
Baby I'm a star I'm shining in the dark
Yuh these my battle scars
Rock me like a band I'll play you like a guitar
Rollin off the dope ashes on my scarf
They can never play me like a deck of cards

[Verse 1 : Poll√†ri]
I just hopped right out the coupe
I been racing after you
Girl I can tell you're lying
Cos I already know the truth
And I was off the boof
And Skies was off the goop ayy
All my brothers shoot girl
I can show you proof
If you're ready for love girl
I'll be there when you call
When it's spring or it's fall
Yeah you know that I ball
If you're ready for love girl
I'll be there when you call
When it's spring or it's fall
Yeah you know that I ball

[Bridge]
Girl you know that I ball
Girl you know that I ball

[Chorus : Lil Skies]
Yuh they know who we are
I can't trust that girl I'm just gon break her heart
Driving in my whip like its a stolen car
Baby I'm a star I'm shining in the dark
Yuh these my battle scars
Rock me like a band I'll play you like a guitar
Rollin off the dopes ashes on my scarf
They can never play me like a deck of cards
