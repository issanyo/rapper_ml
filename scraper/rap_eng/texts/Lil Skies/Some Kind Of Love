[Intro]
Yea
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh yuh, yuh
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Aye

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been trippin, I've been going through some bullshit
I don't care if bitches leave me 'cause I always got my music
I remember when they'd judge me, used to say that I was stupid
Now these people say they love me, I just find it as amusement
(aw, yeah)
We can go there
We don't think the same, we don't feel the same
I remember when they used to doubt my name
Sunny days, full of rain
Ain't no shame in my game, Imma bring that pain, knock the beat out with some Novocaine
I just hit a left hook, god why did you do that?
Always been a cool cat, I'm hanging with the Rugrats
My mom on some other shit, she don't seem happy now
I just wanna get this money so I can buy her a house
I don't know what Imma do, I don't know where Imma go
Too much hurt in my chest I feel like I should let y'all know
When it comes down to this, I'm grindin' for my family
At the end of the day nobody's understanding me
Cigarettes and weed always seem like my remedy
When I'm down in my feelings they just always there for me
But I know it's killin' me, but it makes me feel alive
Never been the type of guy to feed into all the lies
I just want a hunnit mill, I just wanna live life
Stressin out like every day, lately shit don't feel right
We could say it's all good, but I know it's all bad
I just wanna speak the truth that's why I'm always in my bag
Used to gettin' no girls, yeah that shit was so funny
Now I got a white girl, she my little snow-bunny
She my Lucky Charm, she would never split that pole on me
All these niggas switched up, went and sold they soul on me
I remember cold days, I remember dark nights
Say I'm movin' too fast, mix that lean with the sprite
Searchin' for some paradise, in the field with my guys
We just tryna make it out, and we ain't comin' for the ties
(for the ties)

[Chorus]
Middle-fingers in the air
Put your middle-fingers in the air
Middle-fingers in the air, no
Fingers in the air
Put your middle-fingers in the air

[Bridge]
I'm just out here grindin' I just wanna make it far
I ain't worried 'bout them niggas cause I know who we are
Mama told me "dream big" so I'm shooting for the stars
Fuck your opinions 'cause I know who we are, who we are, yea

[Verse 2]
Look, I scream "fuck you and your speculation"
My dedication got me shining with no hesitation
I'm nobody yet, but I know it took some patience
Catch me writing music, focus on my education
People bashin' me, people steady harassin' me
I'm tryna be the best and they just wanna see a casualty
No picture perfect nigga, but I know I'm worth it nigga
Thankful for a father figure, he just made me see it clearer
Damn, times change, and my friends too
All this shit I been through make me jump out a window
See the man in the mirror lookin' lost, I'm just tryna live life
Not worried about the cost, to me I'm my own boss
I hope you niggas get the message, I'm just speaking from my heart I'm tired of all the regret
And used to wake up every morning
Get to yawning, get to stretchin'
Now I wake up every morning thanking god for all my blessings

[Chorus]
Middle-fingers in the air
Put your middle-fingers in the air
Middle-fingers in the air, no
Fingers in the air
Put your middle-fingers in the air

[Bridge]
I'm just out here grindin' I just wanna make it far
I ain't worried 'bout them niggas cause I know who we are
Mama told me "dream big" so I'm shooting for the stars
Fuck your opinions 'cause I know who we are, who we are, yea
(yea, yea, yea)
