[Intro: Lil Skies]
Ridin' in the car, got the, damn, woah, haha, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ridin' in the car, got the juice
She a thottie off the loose, gettin' twisted off the Goose
Got these bitches off the goop, ayy, ayy
I got these bitches off the goop, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ridin' in the car, got the juice
She a thottie off the loose, gettin' twisted off the Goose
Got these bitches off the goop, ayy, ayy
I got these bitches off the goop, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ridin' in the car, got the juice
She a thottie off the loose, gettin' twisted off the Goose
Got these bitches off the goop, ayy, ayy
I got these bitches off the goop, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
She wanna ride with me so come and slide with me
Roll up get high with me, so come inside with me
I'm on some other shit, might fuck another bitch
I ain't the type to switch, girl you know what it is
I'm not the type to lie, why you wanna cry
I see it in your eyes, you look so mesmerized
I'm rollin' off the wood, the gas we smokin' good
Yeah I'm misunderstood, we got that understood
She's wetter than a dream, got cream like Dairy Queen
Yeah she know what I need, my bitch got what I need
She pull up in a Benz, don't really fuck with friends
We at the top again, no you can't box me in
I ball like McGrady, smokin' 'til I'm lazy
They can never change me, say I'm going crazy
I love being faded, that shit help my patience
Say she wanna take it, now she getting naked, hey

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ridin' in the car, got the juice
She a thottie off the loose, gettin' twisted off the Goose
Got these bitches off the goop, ayy, ayy
I got these bitches off the goop, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ridin' in the car, got the juice
She a thottie off the loose, gettin' twisted off the Goose
Got these bitches off the goop, ayy, ayy
I got these bitches off the goop, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2: Sprite Lee]
Okay I'm riding in my coupe, you a lame
You know I'm in another lane
Two hands on the ride even though she got a ring
Hit her all night, let her take away the pain
I got money on my mind, now I'm 'bout to make it rain
Know you wanna ride but I gotta catch a plane
I don't wanna bride, I ain't even mary jane
I don't wanna lie, you and me we ain't the same
She a runaway train, that's a thottie on the loose
She won't leave me 'lone, girl you probably off the Goose
Why you in my phone, I got better shit to do
I don't wanna die alone so I keep her in the loop

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
I got these bitches off the goop, ayy, ayy
I roll a pound of the boof, ayy, ayy
And shawty like me, I'm the truth, ayy, ayy
Her friends fuckin' with me too, ayy, ayy, ayy
And I was

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ridin' in the car, got the juice
She a thottie off the loose, gettin' twisted off the Goose
Got these bitches off the goop, ayy, ayy
I got these bitches off the goop, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ridin' in the car, got the juice
She a thottie off the loose, gettin' twisted off the Goose
Got these bitches off the goop, ayy, ayy
I got these bitches off the goop, ayy, ayy, ayy
