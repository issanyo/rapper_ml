[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
I need a house on the hill
Why she so gone off the pill?
That for the thrill
I got my goons in the cut
Come and pop you if you squeal
Shit is for real
I got this shit out the mud
Livin' like I got a deal
I got a deal
I got connects with the plug
We always keep that concealed
Keep that concealed
Niggas they know what I do, aye
Shooters with me like I hoop, aye
I make her wet like a pool, aye
She wanna fuck in my pool, aye
I'm like "okay baby, cool", aye
You know I don't pick and choose, aye
Fuck with that nigga you loose, aye
You know I'm breakin' the rules, aye
I roll it up like Jamaican, aye
She wanna know what I'm makin', aye
My bitches Persian and Asian, aye
She got that shit I be cravin', aye
And I'm still down with my gang, yuh
What made you think I would change, yuh
We want the money and fame, yuh
I need a bitch who the same, yuh
Pull up in a Tahoe
This is not The Life of Pablo
This the life I had Huncho
Sticky cheese like a nacho
Tryna stack a fuckin' envelope
Countin' Celtics, no Rondo
Fuck apartment, need a condo
Ice on wrist now the time froze
I'ma travel 'round the planet
They don't ever understand it
We was hangin' with the bandits
If he got it, take advantage
Pour a cup of that lean
I be sippin' like a fiend
And she know what I mean
I'ma put her on the team

Mansions 'till my mind up

Crib lookin' like the White House
Livin' like Obama though
I need a foreign and a four door garage
No lease, I'll pay it off
I need a place for the summer, aww yeah
Bitch walkin' 'round with nothin' on
Yuh, sharks in the wall, nigga
Got deer on the lawn, nigga
Got yo bitch at the house party
Yeah, you'll see her in the mornin' nigga
Yuh, growin' weed in the backyard
Pile of kush, got it no charge
I need a sign on my bathroom door that say "no [?]"
Yuh, she asked me how do I feel
High as a house on the hill
Life is a thrill
Get paid to do me and chill
Netflix, she know the drill
They fill the wave
They must've not caught the wave
These niggas stuck in the same
They throwin' salt, got too much time on they hands
Everybody keep it one hundred grand, yuh
