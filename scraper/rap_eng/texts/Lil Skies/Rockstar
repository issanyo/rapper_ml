[Intro: Lil Durk]
Young Chop on the beat
Put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up
Oh, ooh, rockstar
Turn me up Chop

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Put prescription drugs on my tongue, I had to take it
Keep my secrets deep down inside, I had to face it
For you, I put my life on the line, that shit felt crazy

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
They gon' ride still, they made Percs them Advils
Don't you hate when the guys tell? Hate results from a nine shell
Take the fans off of lockdown, securers call, I'ma press one
Felony on my background, gun license, you ain't got one
Trigger finger, catch a nine one, I remember swipin' bad cards
I remember wifin' bad bulls, broke nigga thought the vibe off
I remember totin' cap guns, a lot of pounds of that platinum
A lot of pounds, I go platinum, woah (Rockstar), rockstar
Nigga, fuck your homie, I heard they cappin' too
My homie pull up lookin' like me, you would think they rappin' too
They kill you dead, they sit down calm and smoke a black or two
Salt on his name, they tried to frame him, free Makado

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
A rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Put prescription drugs on my tongue, I had to take it
Keep my secrets deep down inside, I had to face it

[Interlude: Lil Durk & Lil Skies]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
I'm sipping real codeine (Codeine), 200 racks on me (On me)
I done put stars on the roof (On the roof), inside a galaxy (Uh)
Flight after flight, I'm gone (I'm gone), I'm tourin' overseas (Overseas)
My brother doing life (Life), cops never gon' let him free (Fuck them)
These niggas not built like we (Hell nah), broke nigga gon' talk, he cheap (Broke)
Me and Durk top dog like Meech (Like Meech), pack touch, we flood the streets (The streets)
Pray my opps get deceased (They dead), ain't no love for the weak (R.I.P.)
And if I die tonight (R.I.P.), bury me in my dreams, just 'cause
This a rockstar lifestyle, bitches gettin' naked
I roll up like 20 blunts, know that I'ma face it
I been through like too much, why I'm gettin' wasted
Fuck all of the fake shit, they hatin'

[Chorus: Lil Durk & Lil Skies]
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Put prescription drugs on my tongue, I had to take it
Keep my secrets deep down inside, I had to face it
For you I put my life on the line, that shit felt crazy
For you I put my life on the line, that shit felt crazy
For you I put my life on the line, that shit felt crazy
For you I go and unload the nine, that shit so crazy
For you I put my life on the line, that shit felt crazy
