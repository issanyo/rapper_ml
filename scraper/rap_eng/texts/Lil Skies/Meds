[Intro: YBS Skola]
King Midas
Streets so sad
Ride around town, thinkin' 'bout my homie
I need that bag
Got that case a nigga try to get up on me
Stop draggin' my swag
Keep the campaign going, I deserve a trophy
Long live Up Next
Now I gotta do it all on my lonely

[Chorus: YBS Skola]
How they gon' try to compare us? (How?)
I hang with ballers and players (Style)
I could've been in the feds (Gone)
If I wasn't sitting on some bread (Some bread)
But I'm in the house with the money piling (With the money)
Come here, lil' bitch, give me head (Give me head)
She huffin' and puffin' 'bout baby bottles (Shut up)
Baby, I need all my meds (Yeah)
How they gon' try to compare us? (Yeah)
I hang with ballers and players (Ball)
I could've been in the feds (Mall)
If I wasn't sitting on some bread (Woo)
But I'm in the house with the money piling
Come here, lil' bitch, give me head
She huffin' and puffin' 'bout baby bottles
But baby, I need all my meds
Baby, I need all my meds
Baby, I need all my meds
I'm in the house with the money piling
Come here, lil' bitch, give me head
She huffin' and puffin' 'bout baby bottles
But baby, I need all my meds

[Verse 1: YBS Skola]
Wipe off the whips with the rag (Skrrt)
We got bikes we forgot in the shed (Forgot)
Pour up lean and I sip, I don't share (Lean)
Fully loaded, I'm comin' prepared (Yeah)
You'd rather sit 'round and hate
But I'd rather go get to that bread (For sure)
You'd rather go on a date
I'd just rather count money instead (Count dough)
How you don't know what to wear? (How?)
I like for niggas to stare (Stare)
How her ass touching her hair? (Wow)
But I do not like to share (Nah)
We walk around at the fair (Yeah)
Niggas is turnin' they heads (Yeah)
Can't wait to get in the crib (Crib)
Why I thank God in the Benz

[Chorus: YBS Skola]
How they gon' try to compare us? (How?)
I hang with ballers and players (Ball)
I could've been in the feds (Mall)
If I wasn't sitting on some bread (Woo)
But I'm in the house with the money piling
Come here, lil' bitch, give me head
She huffin' and puffin' 'bout baby bottles
But baby, I need all my meds
Baby, I need all my meds
Baby, I need all my meds
I'm in the house with the money piling
Come here, lil' bitch, give me head
She huffin' and puffin' 'bout baby bottles
But baby, I need all my meds

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
Baby I need all my meds
Got blue hundreds, I'm stacking this bread (Cash)
All this drank, got me wakin' up late (Up late)
I got thirty racks stashed by the bed (Bed)
Your girlfriend wanna go on a date (A date)
We in traffic, she givin' me head (Me head)
I'm a boss, I put you in your place (Your place)
Better watch what you say, I ain't playin' (I ain't playin')
You my brother, I ride for my mans (My mans)
You stayed down and you stuck to the plan (The plan)
I got you when you stuck in a jam (A jam)
Ride or die when it comes to the fam (Fam)
Takin' pictures, I shine when the lights off
She wanna know what my chain cost
VVS teeth when I floss
Takin' wins, can't take a loss
All this money, probably need a vault
You doin' bad and it's not my fault
They hatin' on you when you do good
I'm doing me, just as I should
I really wish a pussy nigga would
Me and Skola, we in your hood
Double cup and a Backwood
We live a life that you wish you could
