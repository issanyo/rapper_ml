[Hook: 6 Dogs]
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
New things, old things, dead things
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
New things, old things, dead things

[Verse 1: 6 Dogs]
Look kinda dirty from the Goodwill
Shirt cost a buck, but the belt's real
Smokin' good luck in that clover field
Then we peel off like banana peels
"You won't be shit," that's what they said
"You can eat a dick," that's what I said
I can never be another has been
Stretch this money like elastic, no cappin'
When I'm off the gas, I see dead faces laughin'
Swervin' in the car, and my girl thick like traffic
Poof, no rooftop, gone like magic
Poof, no rooftop, gone like magic

[Hook: 6 Dogs]
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
New things, old things, dead things
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
New things, old things, dead things

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
Ayy, ayy, when I'm off the gas, I can't feel a thing
Baby, I just spend some money on this diamond ring
I’ma hit it from the back, I wanna hear you sing
Like bada bing, bada boom, bada bing, bing
I was swervin', pressin' buttons in the foreign
I don't like to fuck with her because she borin'
I’ma hit it, bust a nut, and then I'm snorin'
They be hatin’ ‘cause a nigga is important
This the life that I know, on the road, doin’ shows
Turnt up with my bros, don’t trust these hoes
Got straight drip on my clothes (yeah)
And I smoke all the dope ‘cause that’s all I know

[Hook: 6 Dogs]
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
New things, old things, dead things
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
When I'm off the gas, I can see things
New things, old things, dead things

[Outro: 6 Dogs]
Please don’t miss me, please don’t miss me
Somewhere floating, please don’t miss me
