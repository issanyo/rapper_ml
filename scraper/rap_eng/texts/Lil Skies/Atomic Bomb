[Intro]
Menoh
Aye, aye, atomic bomb, whoa
Bitch get off my song, whoa
Look at my charm, whoa
Flexing broke my arm, whoa
Bitch I'm the one, might get aggressive for these funds, whoa
He talk for fun, but why we pull up and he run, like

[Verse 1]
He coming for me
It's easy to see
Because I am a beast, bro
I take all the beef
And rip it to piece
And stomp on the street
Nigga you say you the man
But act like a bitch
I don't understand
I fell in love with the bands
Got models in France
Still wanna dance
She was high off the dabs
She want me to smash
Hop in the jag
I had to go get a bag
Now these niggas mad
They going out sad
I'm tryna go to the moon
I'l fuck on that bitch, if she don't suck dick
Then she can't come to my room
And she is a witch, 666
Might fly away on a broom
And you did me dirty
So when you die
Imma go piss on your tomb
I hang with the creatures
I don't do leisures
We gonna skirt off and go zoom (ZOOM)
Eating steak and caviar
With a foreign bitch by the bar
Drop the top just to look at the stars
You wasn't here, didn't care from the start
Don't come around and start playing your part
Look at my diamonds they shine in the dark
Labels keep calling they know imma spark
Jump in the crowd, I can't fuck with the stage
I fell in love with the race
Sweat on my body, tattoos on my face
Start a riot and go beat the case

[Chorus]
I'mma do me you can't change my mind
I was rolling off a pill like it's the perfect time
Come and rage with me, it's a lovely vibe
It's a rave outside, it ain't hard to find
I'mma do me you can't change my mind
I was rolling off a pill like it's the perfect time
Come and rage with me, it's a lovely vibe
It's a rave outside, it ain't hard to find
I'mma do me you can't change my mind
I was rolling off a pill like it's the perfect time
Come and rage with me, it's a lovely vibe
It's a rave outside, it ain't hard to find
