[Lyrics From Snippet]

[Verse]
I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that hoe
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times, the horoscope
Life goes on, I can't take breaks
I need face, no, I need faith
In my mind I can't escape
I climb these heights like I'm a ape
Shine so bright in a world so dark
Break the bank, I'ma break the chart
Two door coupe, just push the start
Come right in, let me break your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need no one, I don't need no one
I don't need no one
Still never sober, still never sober
Got the world on my shoulders
Comin' out bolder, yeah, I'm comin' our bolder
I ride with my soldiers, ride for my soldiers
Thought that I told ya, I thought that I told ya
