Part I: Money Trees Remix

[Chorus]
Me and my niggas stayin' hungry, ya bish, ya bish
Out here workin' for our money, you bitch, you bitch
Niggas prayin' I fall off, ya wish, ya wish
Gettin' full off success, no dish, no dish

[Verse]
I want gold models with gold bottles
Two fast cars at full throttle to drive me through my fantasies, uh
I need good rhymes, no dried lines
And 30 cups of red wine to understand my destiny
See me I'm floatin' in the ocean
Never coastin', they can't hold him
Fast life in the slow lane
Running'through the bread so fast they say I'm loafin'
Came up from the bottom
Young kids, we didn't really even have no options
Now thots be thottin' and all of you foo foo niggas plottin'
Came up from a came up
Lil Skies done changed up
But I'm still on the same team
Doin' things y'all afraid of
I-I've been workin' hard, but I'm still learnin'
I-I don't get no sleep, now my head hurtin'

[Chorus]
We tryna get it, ya bish, ya bish
Out here workin' for my team, ya dig? Ya dig?
Niggas hatin' 'cause Lil Skies
I be grindin' and I'm just not like you other guys

[Outro]
Ya bish, ya bish, ya bish
And we go, and we go
16 16's nigga

Part II: All of My Remix

[Verse]
Look, okay I'm all about my peso, nigga who are you?
Always gotta hustle so I watch where I move
The bills past due, the money on the table
We couldn't pay for cable, now all my niggas stable
I used to sell shoes, I used to sell hats
I tried to make that come up, but never ever trapped
These niggas straight wack so I can't trust 'em
Turn a good girl bad, had to adjust 'em
Money, power, fashion, my only motivation
Niggas tryna test me, deep down they hatin'
People quick to judge me, somethin' like I'm Satan
I've been at the bottom but I'm patiently awaitin'
To smash you nigga, I'ma nigga trash you nigga
You be rappin' like you nice, boy you ass, my nigga
Ask around boy, they tell you Lil Skies that nigga
I been grindin' too hard to come in last my nigga
So I go, spittin' rhymes, they dope
Levitate and I flow
Greatness they know
I'm a prodigy
Probably rocking everybody in the crowd
And I'm known to be wild so I'ma be here for a while
Chambersburg born legend
I'm bringin' niggas down like 9/11
And my verses pop off like MAC-11s

[Outro]
Uh, and it's love
Uh, shout out to P.A
717
Here we go
Team watch me win
I feel like 50 man
16 16's in 16 days
Yeah, uh-huh
