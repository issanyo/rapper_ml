Lyrics From Snippet

[Chorus]
Hold up, walking on a tightrope
How could I switch on you? This the only thing I know
Stay down and be loyal, now we ballin' like the pros
Remember when I used to sit and plan it with the bros
Nowadays I'm just sellin' out the shows
She tell me that she love me, 'cause I am a dark rose
I can't trust nobody, people faking and people fold
You not in my position, I went for this, I was choose

[Verse]
Sacrifices made me the man that I am
If I had to do it, I would go back and do it again
I got money, now they love me, be acting like they my friends
Fuck that shit up, I block them out, I'm not letting them people in
Red eyes, layin' low behind the tent
Remember times running from the cops like jump a fence
Now it's not a problem 'cause I made my mama rich
Fuck them niggas hating, we gon' throw em' in the ditch

[Chorus]
Hold up, walking on a tightrope
How could I switch on you? This the only thing I know
Stay down and be loyal, now we ballin' like the pros
Remember when I used to sit and plan it with the bros
Nowadays I'm just sellin' out the shows
She tell me that she love me, 'cause I am a dark rose
I can't trust nobody, people faking and people fold
You not in my position, I went for this, I was choose
