[Intro]
Yeah, it's hip-hop
Hip-hop
Shout out to my pops
Mike Skies
And guess what, I'm back nigga
And I'm back nigga

[Verse]
I'll take you back to the 90's, I'm a 90's baby
White T's and black beanies like I'm Slim Shady
Sipping Mellow Yellow while I feed my dog Jell-O
She got twelve heads and tryna talk, oh hell no
Flip the script on hip-hop, now you can't read my words
Added verbs, now my punctuation curves
Sitting by the curb eating Nerds while I'm feeding birds
Better swerve or get served
Boy you ain't got the nerve
I see demons try and take my soul
I fought a leprechaun just so I could take his gold
The greatest ever told is really getting old
These boys nothing but mold around the [?]
But check my method, I just perfect it, never neglect it
You get the message
My fan base fat like Precious
I be writing rhymes in school so I don't pay attention
In detention mind floated to a new dimension
Hip-hop's my medicine, I love to overdose
Flying coast to coast with the Holy Ghost in a silver boat
Spent my weekends writing rhymes in my basement
Now my flow dangerous, I'll leave you in the pavement
Vamp life so we never sleep at night
My mind's full of parasites
Is that what you call paradise?
Dudes be looking shook like a pair of dice
You claim you dope but these other niggas don't think you're nice
Middle fingers to the niggas that be hating
Out here making changes but we ain't the ones that's changing
We steady elevating
It took some patience
Now bow down to greatness
You say your flow's sick but honestly it's constipated
Listening to some Big Daddy Kane
On my way to play basketball with my nigga Blaine
We ain't the same but we think like we got two brains
Maintain to spit flame, now we bout to reach the fame

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm eating donuts with your mom
And that's just how it go
Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
Shout out to the fat dude that shoots my videos
I forget your name though
By the way what up Phil
Peace to all my 'nillas, let's go
