[Chorus]
Ayy, I just wanna ball, tell my haters that I'm sorry
Yeah I want it all, tell me who is gonna stop me
Let that hate dissolve, flyest niggas in the party
I step in this bitch feelin' like I'm John Gotti
I just wanna ball, tell my haters that I'm sorry
Yeah I want it all, tell me who is gonna stop me
Let that hate dissolve, flyest niggas in the party
I step in this bitch feelin' like I'm John Gotti

[Verse]
She a model girl, I put my hands all on her body
I don't do average, girl, she ride me 'cause she feelin' gnarly
I got a Backwood, I be smokin' like I'm Bob Marley
Take a puff, skrrt off fast like I'm in a 'Rari
I be on some shit that people never seen before
He said he down to ride but switched up, that is not your bro
She said she fuck with you but talkin' 'bout you on the low
I'm just sayin' shorty choosin', gotta watch your ho
Takin' chances that they told me that I shouldn't take
Now I sit back and laugh at them 'cause they was full of hate
And time is money, we can't talk if it ain't 'bout the cake
Now you an actor, fake, bitch just get out my face

[Chorus]
I just wanna ball, tell my haters that I'm sorry
Yeah I want it all, tell me who is gonna stop me
Let that hate dissolve, flyest niggas in the party
I step in this bitch feelin' like I'm John Gotti
I just wanna ball, tell my haters that I'm sorry
Yeah I want it all, tell me who is gonna stop me
Let that hate dissolve, flyest niggas in the party
I step in this bitch feelin' like I'm John Gotti
