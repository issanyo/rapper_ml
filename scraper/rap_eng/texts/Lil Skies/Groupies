Niggas, they wanna be gang. fuck is you saying? (hold up)
I go super saiyan (ha) no I am not playing

Wanna take flicks, flick of my wrist
Thumbing through money think I got six
Dunk on these niggas like Julius Erving
Ball on these bitches like I am Kyrie Irving
I told her don't like her, she think that she perfect
She went to that lame to find out he was worthless
Niggas still hate but come to my shows
Boy you a fan and I already know
Lying yourself, and you will get exposed
Rap because I really rap what I be on

Pussy nigga better run
Run it, Run it, Run it up

Roll my wood on her butt
While she is suckin' on my nut
