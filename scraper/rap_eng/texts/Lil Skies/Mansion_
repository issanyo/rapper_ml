[Intro]
Hey Cris, fuck you
Ayy, ayy, yeah
Told that nigga she the one, that was not for fun
[?]
Told that nigga she the one, it was not for fun
[?]
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus ]
Only bad hoes in my mansion, huh
My diamonds dancin'
Catch a body like Charles Manson, huh
Watch them [?]
I just grind and do the damage, huh
My bitch Atlantic, fuck her good make me a sandwich, huh
Now she romantic

[Verse 1]
Where you at when we was broke, you didn't trap with us
Nigga asked why he got slapped cuz he was actin' up
They want that bitch, boy you can have her, she was trash as fuck
You want some smoke then wear a vest, my niggas ready to bust
I8, doors up, I pull up makin' a scene
All these bitches all on me, you know I'm dripped to the tee
Pretty nigga, pretty bitch, we don't speak brokanese
Good weed, bad women, live my life like a king
That's right, give me head like lice
Skinny ting, nice ass, she gon' ride it like a bike
I don't right no waves, pussy niggas like mice
Ball hard like Mike, take it to a perfect height

[Chorus]
And that's why only bad hoes in my mansion, huh
My diamonds dancin'
Catch a body like Charles Manson, huh
Watch them [?]
I just grind and do the damage, huh
My bitch Atlantic, fuck her good make me a sandwich, huh
Now she romantic
