[Intro]
Yeah, woah
Woah
Yeah, yeah
What?
Ayy

[Chorus]
Roll up my Backwood and let me get high
Keep this money by my side, I had to sacrifice
She say she love me, she don't love me, that's a damn lie
I play for keeps, fuck a loss and a damn tie
Grab my lean, smoke my weed, need some more Sprite
I've been down for a while, am I on your mind?
I don't really care too much, that's how I feel inside
I be smokin' all the time because it feels right
Niggas actin' like my bros and we ain't even tight

[Verse 1]
More ice
She wanna stay the night, tell lil shorty, "Catch a flight"
I was down in M-I-A fuckin' bitches, actin' trife
You wanna be my wife, ride it like you ride a bike
All this money in my hands, I'ma throw it on the ground
Like it when you back it up but better when you take it down
What don't break me only make me, smokin' OG out the pound
I got niggas that will shoot but if cops come don't make a sound
So, I sit back and watch, pray I see another day
Got Gucci with Supreme, shawty different in her way
Rock Chanel all the time, we go shoppin' in the Bay
East side in PA, they ain't loyal where I stay
So I'm out here layin' low, dodgin' vibes that I don't need
Everybody want somebody, don't confuse that with your needs
Send a message to my shorty, this ain't workin', gotta leave
I've been up, hardly sober, so let me

[Chorus]
Roll this Backwood and let me get high
Keep this money by my side, I had to sacrifice
She say she love me, she don't love me, that's a damn lie
I play for keeps, fuck a loss and a damn tie
Grab my lean, smoke my weed, need some more Sprite
I've been down for a while, am I on your mind?
I don't really care too much, that's how I feel inside
I be smokin' all the time because it feels right
Niggas actin' like my bros and we ain't even tight
Keep this money by my side, I had to sacrifice
She say she love me, she don't love me, that's a damn lie
I play for keeps, fuck a loss and a damn tie
Grab my lean, smoke my weed, need some more Sprite
I've been down for a while, am I on your mind?
I don't really care too much, that's how I feel inside
I be smokin' all the time because it feels right
Niggas actin' like my bros and we ain't even tight

[Verse 2]
No, no
You actin' like my bro, but you really gonna fold
I ain't tryna make no friends, I've been lonely down this road
I've been ridin' through the Hills, takin' views through the scope
Thumbin' through this cash, yeah, flexin' on my ex
And I can't get no rest, nah, I'm tryna be my best
I'm a monster in the flesh, think she want me 'cause I'm next
And I don't worry 'bout her moves 'cause she know I ain't pressed
Lately I've been stressed, press reset
I've been in the mix, let me pop a Percocet
Baby, let's get drunk and fuck like we first met
And I ain't got no plans when you slide and send a text

[Outro]
Yeah, ayy, ayy
Roll up this Backwood, just let me get high
Yeah, I just need to get high
I don't care what they say, I gotta get high
