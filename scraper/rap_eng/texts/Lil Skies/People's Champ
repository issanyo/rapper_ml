[Intro: Lil Skies]
Captain Crunch presents
Ay
Jay mothafuckin' $plash
Sippin Easter pink
Ay, I'm sippin Easter pink
Ay, ay, ay

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Double up my cup
I'm sippin' Easter pink
Oh, she down to fuck
Don't care what people think
All of my diamonds wet
Like I bathe in the sink
No, I'm the people's champ
Come jump up in the ring, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
I'm a rockstar
I need a rockstar bitch
I got a rockstar wrist
I'm on some rockstar shit, yeah
Oh, you got shooters
My shooters shoot, don't miss
My gang is too legit
Too legit to quit, yuh

[Verse 1: Lil Gnar]
Double up my cup
Pourin' easter pink
Glock to your brain
Tell me what you think
Double up my Glock
Swinging like a chump
If you wanna fight
Nigga knockin' [?], yuh
Off three different drugs
Imma talk my shit
I'm a rockstar
I don't give a fuck, bitch
My wrist Cartier
I get Carti, yuh
Thumbin' through these bands
Til' my thumb get sore
She just wanna fuck
Cause I got the drip
Droptop 911, I push movie whips
Motivated
Other niggas was hatin'
Worked then I made a way
Now I'm the one just like The Matrix

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Double up my cup
Im sippin' easter pink
Oh, she down to fuck
Don't care what people think
All of my diamonds wet
Like I bathe in the sink
No, I'm the people's champ
Come jump up in the ring, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
I'm a rockstar
I need a rockstar bitch
I got a rockstar wrist
I'm on some rockstar shit
Oh, you got shooters
My shooters shoot, don't miss
My gang is too legit
Too legit to quit, yeah

[Outro: Lil Gnar]
Imma rockstar
I sell rock shit
Need a rock bitch
Need a rock bitch
Imma rockstar
I sell rock shit
Need a rock bitch
Need a rock bitch
