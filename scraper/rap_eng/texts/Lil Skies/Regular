Hey

To reduce the pain, we don't ever have no doubts

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Yuh! I'm flippin' work like I'm Jackie Chan
Niggas be hatin' they been a fan
I got them goons like the Taliban
Jump in the pussy I'm swervin'
That bitch be knowin' her purpose
I leave the bitch like it's urgent
Fuck her pull open the curtains
I smoke the Tooka can barely breathe
I squash her out like a centipede
Come over here and get on your knees
We take a picture she saying "cheese'!
Raw got the work for the low, aye!
He bussin' jug by the store, aye!
Kick her right outta the door, aye!
If she a thot she 'on go, aye

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
Aye

Don't want my weed in a Dutch, aye

Might pour a four in my cup, aye
Might just pull up in a truck, aye
Might just swag out on you punks, aye
Leprechaun dopers below, aye

[Verse 3: AWG Taydo3]
My niggas is shooters they ready to rock
Bitches they with me they ride til they die
Roll through your city not talkin' to cops
Shooters stay with me they strapped with a nine
Aim for your head, don't aim for no thighs
Killin' this shit with my bro Lil Skies
Shootin' like Kobe so {dunk on your thot}
Stay in the kitchen my hand in the pot
Grabbin' the whip then i skrrt off the lot
Bitches stay with me they love to give top
Runnin' this shit, like I'm a Roth
Sippin' on lean, don't sip no Ciroc
Y'all niggas hatin' my niggas on top
Fly to Miami with {bitch} drop the top
These hoes {don't go on} red like a stop
Smoke the best loud it came from up top
Stuff up the Wood, can't hit and I cough
Got all the pack, {flipped} that shit off
Moved it so quick, they call me Chris Paul
Free all my niggas that's locked behind bars
Catchin' this wave, but duckin' the law
Catchin' this wave, but duckin' the law
Catchin' this wave, but duckin' the law
Catchin' this wave, but duckin' the law
