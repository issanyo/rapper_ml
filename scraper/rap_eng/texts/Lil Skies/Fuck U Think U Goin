[Intro: PnB Rock]
Monsta's gon' tear it up
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I just wanna wake up to you in the morning
You been gone way too long
What you doing?
Say you tryna leave, girl
Fuck you think you going?
Fuck you think you going? You ain't going nowhere
'Cause I just wanna wake up to you in the morning
You been gone way too long
What you doing?
Say you tryna leave, girl
Fuck you think you going?
Fuck you think you going? You ain't going nowhere

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Fuck you think you going? You ain't going nowhere
You the only one that I wanted and you know it
You ain't leaving if it's something I could do about it
I fucked about a million times, but who's counting
Broke yo heart, made you cry
Girl, I told so many lies
All yo friends telling you to leave me
This shit ain't gon' stop
One more chance
Girl, that's all I need
Just give me one more time
Yeah, just to make it better
Yeah, girl, you deserve better
Yeah, all these hoes are jealous
Yeah, shawty, you so special
You keep tryna roll on me, shawty I won't let you
Nah, and I know you miss the sex with me
Shawty, I just wanna wake up with you next to me

[Chorus: PnB Rock & Lil Skies]
I just wanna wake up to you in the morning (In the morning)
You been gone way too long
What you doing? (What you doing?)
Say you tryna leave, girl
Fuck you think you going? (Why you fuckin with me?)
Fuck you think you going? You ain't going nowhere (Why you fuckin with me? Why you fuckin with me?)
'Cause I just wanna wake up to you in the morning (In the morning)
You been gone way too long
What you doing? (What you doing?)
Say you tryna leave, girl
Fuck you think you going? (Why you fuckin with me?)
Fuck you think you going? You ain't going nowhere (Why you fuckin with me? Why you fuckin with me?)

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
Ayy lil shawty, something special to me
Why you fucking with me? Is it 'cause the money?
Love your body, physique, you outstanding I see
I get deep in that pussy, no she barely can breathe
I'm a dog, I'm a beast, fuck them niggas they weak
Was 10,000 that's cheap, spend dat shit in my sleep
I'm the goat and they the sheep
No one compares to we
Make her hit those melodies, no she won't tell on me
Make you go down down, down
Baby turn that thing around round, round
Call me daddy when you moaning
I wanna wake up to you every morning
And baby girl

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I just wanna wake up to you in the morning
You been gone way too long
What you doing?
Say you tryna leave, girl
Fuck you think you going?
Fuck you think you going? You ain't going nowhere
'Cause I just wanna wake up to you in the morning
You been gone way too long
What you doing?
Say you tryna leave, girl
Fuck you think you going?
Fuck you think you going? You ain't going nowhere
