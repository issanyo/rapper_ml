[Intro]
Ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Big money on me, nigga, I'ma run it up
'Cause I remember I was broke and I ain't have enough
Now I'm fly, she like to back it up
No surprise, now she fuck with us
Big money on me, nigga, I'ma run it up
'Cause I remember I was broke and I ain't have enough
Now I'm fly, she like to back it up
No surprise, now she fuck with us

[Verse 1]
I walk in the bank, look like a walking lick
All these bitches fuck with us, we on some jiggy shit
Niggas hate, they in the way, I stay up out the mix
She know I'm a trick and treat, don't do relationships
Nigga we gon' hit no miss, no we don't do no diss
Buy it, we don't care for cents, no I can't pay your rent
She a freak, she lick the tip
I'm with my brothers smoking sliding when we in the tent
My cup so dirty it might kill you when you take a sip
Bitch I'm so high think I'm the pilot of this battleship
Hopped in the car, sped off too fast and almost crashed my whip
The cops come for me, then I'm silent I could never snitch
That's on Rakim, nigga

[Chorus]
Big money on me, nigga, I'ma run it up
'Cause I remember I was broke and I ain't have enough
Now I'm fly, she like to back it up
No surprise, now she fuck with us
Big money on me, nigga, I'ma run it up
'Cause I remember I was broke and I ain't have enough
Now I'm fly, she like to back it up
No surprise, now she fuck with us

[Verse 2]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
And now they like me 'cause I'm winning, gotta keep my distance
When I was broke and had no name they always kept forgetting
Shoot like I'm Pippen, I'ma score, can hear that in my writtens
If I'm a dog then you a pussy, I'ma beat the kitten
I'ma triple threat, make a hook and cash the check
Now they see a nigga next, mad I got 'em so upset
Pop a pill she not herself, rolling off these Percocets
She the freaky type for sex, got her rubbing on her breasts

[Chorus]
Big money on me, nigga, I'ma run it up
'Cause I remember I was broke and I ain't have enough
Now I'm fly, she like to back it up
No surprise, now she fuck with us
Big money on me, nigga, I'ma run it up
'Cause I remember I was broke and I ain't have enough
Now I'm fly, she like to back it up
No surprise, now she fuck with us
