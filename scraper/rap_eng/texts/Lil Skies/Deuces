[Intro - Lil Skies]
Uh, one time for the, one time for the
Huh, one time for the
Look
[Lil Skies]
I'm wearing all gold like a king
Rubies with the diamond rings
Fuck the bling, chasing dreams and serving them to the fiends
I'm a
Minor in his cold mind with the cold mind of Einstein, dropping knowledge every line
I'm god
They can't tell me nothing
Why is you bluffing?
I'm the topic of discussion
Faded off this robitussin
I'm a Nikon to my youth, lyrical in the booth
Captain of my troops
Letting loose, I'm busting on her tooth
My flow nasty and grimy
Promise I'm back at it, smashing all you rap faggots who always been backstabbing
Teachers told me 'focus', but fuck it, I'm writing lyrics
Raising spirits, holy and gifted, I hope you hear it
I only fear god in the odds of being odd
Without a prod. reppin' everyday like it's my job
I know that's the motion, wrap my Jimmy in a trojan
Before I swim in the girl's ocean
It's funny how they think they know me
My mind's suicide, yet, I'm feeling too alive
See me and Neek we rise but y'all hate
Niggas faking
Wanna be a Jason
Working on my education
Tryna make it to my destination
But me being me, I just wanna get high
Ride past pretty bitches here in Malsay High
But, hey!
Life's a game but this ain't no fucking 2k
Don't give a fuck about what you say
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
Said, I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
Im chucking up th-
[Neek]
I'm having visions of givin'
Givin' up on this competition
And saying, 'fuck it man' and givin' in to the opposition
But then I start having visions of how I was sitting
At my desk in sixth grade writing rhymes in my composition
Of the curvin' life I'm livin'
If that ain't too fulfilling than I don't know what's appealing
It's like everytime I write
My future life becomes revealing
But, it's crazy 'cause the future is still so concealing
Layin' back with my eyes on the ceiling
Can't even tell you what I'm fuckin' feeling but I'm thinking 'bout a million
A million damn ways to help my mom care for the children
New cup, new crib
Yeah that's a good-ass feelin'
Givin' up on the world
And no longer givin' a fuck 'bout a girl
'Cause when you worry 'bout girls
That shit will fuck up the world
Cause you gon' say 'you my world'
Then buy her diamonds and pearls
But in the end, she gon' switch up
Man, that's the way of the world
[Neek & Lil Skies]
So don't be trustin' these girls
They all they slick but greasy like Jheri Curls
On a scale from 1-10
We masterminds with the pen
As we sit in the wind
Write rhymes they comprehend, so
[Lil Skies]
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
I'm chucking up the deuces, deuces
I'm chucking up the deuces, deuces
I'm chucking up the deuces, deuces
Bitch, bitch, bitch, haha!
I'm chucking up the deuces
Neek we ballin' in a new way
I pull up with a new wave, a new wave, a new wave
