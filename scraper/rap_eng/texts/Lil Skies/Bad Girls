[Hook: Lil Skies]
I like good girls, these bad girls
They're not meant for me
You get one shot, don't fuck it up
Turn to my enemy
I can't feel your vibe
You're telling lies
That's not my energy
Girl that's not my energy
So get the fuck away from me
I like good girls, these bad girls
They're not meant for me
You get one shot, don't fuck it up
Turn to my enemy
I can't feel your vibe
You're telling lies
That's not my energy
Girl that's not my energy
So get the fuck away from me

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Take up my time
They talkin' shit through the 'vine
Don't let it get to my mind
Chills down her spine
She play it back like rewind
I see the heights and I climb
Not 'fraid to jump
I got the work in my trunk
Roll up a 'Wood of that skunk
These niggas suck
How you talk that but gave up?
She look good with no makeup
She's not a Barbie, she's not a groupie
She's not a girl that you see in the movies
Is he a rockstar? He got a Uzi
He's with the bad guys and he is shooting
Thought he was winning but he is losing
She like the ballers, dudes who be hooping
I was on lay low, stacking while moving
I like the good ones, sorry for choosing

[Bridge: Lil Skies]
She's a good girl, she do what I say so
We both grind and go get those pesos
Say she fell in love, he might fuck her by the rainbow
We know that these lames know
They ain't ever getting close
I inhale the good smoke, blow it out the window
I brought the whole gang with me, this is for my kinfolk
You was always lane switching, thought you was with this side
No you can't be choosing sides, I am just too out of sight

[Hook: Lil Skies]
I like good girls, these bad girls
They're not meant for me
You get one shot, don't fuck it up
Turn to my enemy
I can't feel your vibe
You're telling lies
That's not my energy
Girl that's not my energy
So get the fuck away from me
I like good girls, these bad girls
They're not meant for me
You get one shot, don't fuck it up
Turn to my enemy
I can't feel your vibe
You're telling lies
That's not my energy
Girl that's not my energy
So get the fuck away from me

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Woke up in a big old white mansion, I make Obama moves
My chick so bad but still fuck me like she got something to prove
If you be good to big Gucci then I'll be good to you
I'm not too hood for you baby, I'm just not into you
I don't want no mediocre, I'm not no average joker
Big old white diamond choker, I think I'm Casanova
This ain't no interview, lady, you asking crazy questions
They see me flexin' VVS's in my diamond necklace
McLaren drivin' reckless, Trap God don't miss your blessin'
Good girl come get your lesson
Lil Skies these bitches tellin'
I sold so many records
I know so many felons
Now I see these bitches checkin'
Now I see these niggas jealous
