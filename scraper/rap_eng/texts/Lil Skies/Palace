Tell that bitch "Get in the car" (let's go)
I smoke this beat like a Maverick (yah)

Bet you she think I'm a star

Go karate on her little body

Look at them niggas and tell 'em stop me

I'ma disappear for a month then pull up in a coupe
Flow so cold that I might need soup
Got a new hoe cause my old bitch poop
Rolled ten blunts now I'm feelin' like I'm Snoop
Been had the juice 2pac and Q

I just sit back and think on what it was
I don't show love if you ain't showin' love
Balance my life the weed takes me above
Me I smoke weed I'm not poppin' a xannie
I fucked her sister think her name was Tammy
Tammy told Sasha now Sasha hate Tammy
I beat the pussy she callin' me Manny
My brothers don't listen, we breakin' the rules
Fuck everybody, I know what I do
Fuck every girl who said I'm a fool
Saucin' at school
Bitch I am that dude, I'ma
Pull up with a new hoe
That's dirty Sprite no Nuvo
My mind take trips to Pluto

My bitch she keep the secret
Put niggas in the cement

Hoe it ain't hard to see it, yuh
