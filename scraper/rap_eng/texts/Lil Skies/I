[Intro]
One time just a little bit, I
One time just a little bit, I
One time just a little bit, I
I
Danny, I see you

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that hoe
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
I said I'm gonna change but I know I won't
I get high I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times when no horoscope

[Verse 1]
Life goes on I can't take breaks
I need faith, no I need faith
In my mind I can't escape
I climb these heights like I'm an ape
Shine so bright but the world so dark
Break the bank I'ma break the chart
Two door coupe just push the stop
Come right in let me break your heart

[Post-Chorus]
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
Still never sober
Still never sober
Got the world on my shoulders
Comin' out bolder
Yeah, I'm comin' out bolder
I ride with my soliders
Ride for soilders
Thought that I told you
I thought that I told you

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that hoe
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
I said I'm gonna change but I know I won't
I get high I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times when no horoscope

I-I-I-I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that hoe
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
I said I'm gonna change but I know I won't
I get high I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times when no horoscope

[Verse 2]
I-I-I don't want the fame
I don't want to play these games
Tired of hiding from the pain
Never hanging with the lames
I-I'm not the one for the stupid shit
We try to speak on some movie shit
And she came right through with some groovie shit
You surprised how they act when they know you lit

[Chorus]
I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that hoe
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
I said I'm gonna change but I know I won't
I get high I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times when no horoscope
