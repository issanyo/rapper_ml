Uh huh, ooh

[Producer Tag]
You are watching a master at work

[Verse]
Look, my hard times with me and grown man
'Member when I used to hide the work inside a soda can
Cops pull me over, I ain't going, I ain't getting jammed
Stanley hitting licks just to get some money in his hand
Back on Garfield, I used to like those days
Hit the pool, fuck some hoes with my A.I. braids
Me and Cam fighting niggas, had our psycho ways
God had me in his plans 'cause my life done changed
I used to sit and think about how my ass could make a mil
I was working on the plan like, "fuck the critics and the deal"
Hate asking mom for money 'cause I know she got bills
So we started robbing niggas, but I didn't like to steal
Saw my uncle sell drugs, back then he was the plug
Everybody showed him love from the hood to the club
I used to think that shit was cool until he got locked up
And to me he was my idol, yeah, that shit fucked me up
My grandmother used to cry every time he had court
I used to hide behind the shed just to smoke a Newport
Stopped smoking cigarettes 'cause it was hard for me to breathe
Now I'm tearing down stages, making waves they believe
Fuck a trend, I don't need a friend, I just need a Benz
My loose ends knotted up, now they can't comprehend
Pray my shit stay afloat, but if not I'm gonna swim
I'ma ball on these niggas even if I'm wearing Timbs
And my mom go to work every night of her life
Her back fucked up, but, for us, she making it right
When it was dark and we ain't have it she still gave us the light
Smoking weed, hardly sober, but my future is bright
And I'm still making plays like I couldn't get a job
I ain't want no nine to five, tell me I'm my own boss
Fucked up my own bread so I had to take a loss
I ain't like these other niggas doing shit criss cross
Where I'm from it's hard to make it, but I know that I'ma make it out
Stay inside, stack my bread and figure out a safer route
Now these hoes wanna fuck me 'cause they see what I'm about
Tryna buy my moms a crib but you can sit and have your doubts
I got no time for the games, I got no time for you lames
I'm a soldier to this shit so I ain't fearing no pain
Had my head in the rain, no, we ain't feeling the same
I been working on myself, I feel I needed a change
I got shit to lose, but I ain't got shit to prove
These rappers is old news, paying for some YouTube views
(yeah, yeah, ayy)

[Chorus]
And this is what I call life
Roll my Backwood while outside
Let my shawty slide, watch the sunrise
She just wanna fuck and have a good time
And this is what I call life
Roll my Backwood while outside
Let my shawty slide, watch the sunrise
She just wanna fuck and have a good time
And this is what I call life
