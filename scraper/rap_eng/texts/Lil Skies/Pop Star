[Intro]
Know
Girl, I just gotta know
Know, ayy

[Chorus]
Girl, I just gotta know, are you in it for the dough?
I'ma have to let you go, I can't trust you, little hoe
Live your life like a pop star, yeah she like to party with a rockstars
I'ma let her play and pull her strings like a guitar
Tatted on my face in Japanese, I got a cold heart
Drivin' in that foreign, there's no keys, you gotta push to start

[Verse]
Yeah, pockets so heavyweight (weight), chant me like Ali the great (great)
Love when she give me face, movin' in and outta state (state)
What I'ma do today? Hit the store, pick up lil bae (lil bae)
Shop like a holiday, these niggas can't hang with us
They tried to drop a bag and we left them in the dust
I got my brothers in this bitch and we don't talk too much
You get to fussin' out yo lip, get hit with uppercuts
We all around the map, nice cars we be swervin', I'm bossed up with a purpose
And they used to think I was worthless, now they all on me like I'm perfect
And she's not the type to be nervous, been gettin' money you learnin'
You stuck in a shell, I'm no hermit, I want more green but no kermit, huh

[Bridge]
It's your life, try to live it up in one night
Never let nobody change your mind
Sometimes you gotta make a sacrifice

[Chorus]
Girl, I just gotta know, are you in it for the dough?
I'ma have to let you go, I can't trust you, little hoe
Live your life like a pop star, she like to party with a rockstars
I'ma let her play and pull her strings like a guitar
Tatted on my face in Japanese, I got a cold heart
Drivin' in that foreign, there's no keys, you gotta push to start
