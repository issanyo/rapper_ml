You can't hang if you ain't gang, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Smoking gas with the gang I had to make my way
You cuff that bitch, I fucked that bitch I think, like yesterday
Ooh ooh tryna pull up in that foreign car
All these bitches on my dick tryna have a m√©nage
All these niggas claim they balling, I don't see no racks
I was finessing, had to put my city on my back
I got that cash then spend it fast, but then I made it back
You know I gotta watch my back they tryna catch me lack
Eh, pull up balling like I fucking hoop, eh
She rock Jordans she don't need no Jimmy Choos, eh
She like me and what I do cause I can't lose, eh
Smoking gas this that shit that make you snooze, eh
She water wet so I just fucked her by the pool, eh
I'ma need another girl because she two faced
Bitches tryna tie me down, what is a shoe lace
Ice in my cubes guess it was a good day

Ah yeh yeh yeh in the V.I.P
Cup keeps the pink [?] full of THC

[Hook: Lil Skies]
You can't hang if you ain't gang, yeah
