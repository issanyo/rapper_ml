[Intro]
Yuh, yuh, aye, aye
Yeah, you know I'm rocking
Aye, oh, ooh
Pipe up, yuh

[Hook]
I got the money and I got the music I feel so excited
My city told me I got it so I can not sit back and hide it
I'm smoking this weed now I look at the sky and I feel like I'm flying
Niggas be talking and bitches be talking the media all lying, I know
Ah, this one for them real niggas that know, don't change up for no fuck nigga that's broke
That fast life, no red light we go, she love me I don't love her she knows

[Verse 1]
Step in this bitch I get the money and act like I'm Mitch
Feeding my city with bangers and hits
Only blow two I can't fuck with them meds
She gon' get freaky by showing her tits
Stanley he coming might run in your crib
Niggas be talking don't know how I live
Honestly I don't have no fucks to give, I might fuck his bitch then send her ass back, she is a thot and that is a fact, she fucking with opps don't fall for the trap
The kitty was good till' she turned to a rat
We gon' get rich and travel the map, might just go shopping and blow a whole stack, trust me I got it don't worry bout' that, don't think shit is sweet just cause I can rap
I'm not for the talk and I'm not for the games
I wanna Rarri' and thirty gold chains
I wanna bitch that is more than a dame, she looking so good I'm like what is her name
Half of these bitches done been through my game
My niggas jiggy can't fuck with you lames
Niggas will switch up for money and fame
These bitches keep stopping that's part of the game
See me in public you know I stay fly
Stressing to much like I got to get high, my money straight, but my women all bi
Wrap the game up I caught y'all by surprise
Lil Skies be balling I'm ready to kill
Still 17 and i don't have a deal
Fuck all your morals don't care how you feel
Popping like xanny's, no I don't do pills

[Hook]
I got the money and I got the music I feel so excited
My city told me I got it so I can not sit back and hide it
I'm smoking this weed now I look at the sky and I feel like I'm flying
Niggas be talking and bitches be talking the media all lying, I know
Ah, this one for them real niggas that know, don't change up for no fuck nigga that's broke
That fast life, no red light we go, she love me I don't love her She knows

[Verse 2]
Step in this bitch, me I don't sleep cause I wanna be rich
Ride for my niggas I can't be a snitch, hoes didn't love me now they on my dick, back in the day when I didn't have shit
Look at me now like I can't even trip, my heart is mellow, I ball like the Knick's
John is my shooter, he shoot and don't miss
Treat him my brother, and that is a fact
He get to work and take down to the track
Get some more work and turn that to a rack
He add it up he just never subtract
Oh my god, who are you, little bitch you're a fool
Shawty like a swimming pool, she just wanna wear my jewels
I just wanna see you dance I don't want to see your pants
Oh, she wanna touch my bandz, yeah, my jacket came from France
Feeling like I'm Billie Jean , Moonwalk on your main hoe
If she say she feeling lucky fuck her by the rainbow  I just spit Those flames though reeboks and a raincoat
Goosing up the rango, hop out like a kango
Niggas don't want no one, and niggas don't want no beef , anybody any beat, can come and get deceased, oh my god

[Hook]
I got the money and I got the music I feel so excited
My city told me I got it so I can not sit back and hide it
I'm smoking this weed now I look at the sky and I feel like I'm flying
Niggas be talking and bitches be talking the media all lying, I know
Ah, this one for them real niggas that know, don't change up for no fuck nigga that's broke
That fast life, no red light we go, she love me I don't love her she knows
