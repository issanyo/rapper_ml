Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro]
Ayy
I can't sleep
I can't breathe

[Chorus]
I can't sleep
I can't breathe
When I wake up
Will you still be
Don't give a fuck
I can't breathe

[Verse 1]
Ayy, ayy
Plugs on my phone said the pack is on the way
Said I won't stop smoking then I take them to the face
I was only stoned but for her I made a change
I don't want nobody who gon' put me through the pain
When the rain stops pouring
Everything comes out
Girl you're way too gorgeous to be stuck in the house
I would give you everything
Fuck what they all talkin' about
