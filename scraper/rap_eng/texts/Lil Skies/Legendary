[Verse]
I'll punch you in the back, my hands come through your belly button
These rappers got dope beats but their lyrics ain't nothing
They talk about giving love for their town and think they stunting
My team hit it out the park when your team be bunting
See I'm a kid who's tryna live a dream
This lifestyle is a movie and I skip too many scenes
But when I look back it's not as good as it seems
But I started from nothing and turned it all into a thing
But Illuminati tryna tie me in a knot
But I'll never go to hell cause I don't want my soul to rot
Cause I'm only 13, in five more years I'll be a man
And I'm gonna work hard, there's no defeat in my plans
But I stand tall, stay strong cause I ain't done son
Cause I pray to God that he lets me be number one
Cause I give more time and I think with my head
I popped up in this rap game just like some toaster bread
But on these beats I devour anybody
Who thinks they're raw when they know they're sour
You work for a couple minutes when I work for 8 hours
Go home, eat my dinner, than I take a long shower
They ask me why I act gold, cause I feel I really am
I go past the limit, go up high like I'm Peter Pan
I go hard young bull homie and I never sleep
These rappers 14 days cause they all too weak
But I just give it my all and I hope I never fall
But I'm destined for up so my team we gonna ball
When you ask me do I want to be famous? No
I wanna be legendary, that is the kid who makes the changes
I studies all the greats and gave it a lot of time
To let my bars lock up, I ain't committing crimes
In these lines
Instead I'm sitting back putting my pain up in these lines
You feel the deepness in my songs as I flow along
But you can stand under me if you don't understand
Growing up so fast I swear it's hard to be a humble man
I'm wise, you could tell when you look into my eyes
You see nothing but stars that's way up in the sky
I worked hard in my academy, you see me building strategy
I give effort, I don't care who's mad at me
Cause all this rap music is really helping me
And one day I wanna be known as a prodigy

[Hook]
Forget being famous
I wanna be legendary, the kid who makes the changes
I'm going down in history
I'm tryna be a beast
When it comes to ripping beats
Lil Skies'll bring that heat
I said forget being famous
I wanna be legendary, the kid who makes the changes
I'm going down in history
I'm tryna be a beast
When it comes to ripping beats
Lil Skies'll bring that heat

[Outro]
Yeah, making good music from the soul
We don't believe in illuminati
Just keep it real and let the beat flow
