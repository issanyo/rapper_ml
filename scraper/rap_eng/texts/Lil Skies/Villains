[Intro - Lil Skies]
All I wanted was a million
All I wanted was a million
All I wanted was a million
All I wanted was a million

[Hook - Lil Skies]
All I wanted was a million
Getting money is the greatest feeling
I be with the hoes that look Brazilian
All my niggas jiggy, we be killing
I just want the millions
Stack my bread I wanna see them billions
Fuckboys be mad, caught in they feelings
They hate cause we the villains of the village

[Verse 1 - Lil Skies]
With my new bitch, she wearing foreign
And she don't fuck with him because he boring
I be in the clouds, bitch I be soaring
Off the ENG then I just pour it
Smoking loud, she just wanna party
She drank too much and now she actin naughty
I let her hit the [?] and now she floating
Her friends fuck with the gang because we [?]
Cooling with some older niggas who gon ride for me
I had to get it by myself and now they copy me
Them snakes maneuver through the grass just like a soccer team
Niggas changing over green, I seen some crazy things
And I'm a young nigga, I got no regrets
I never trust an opp, especially when they tryna flex
I got people hit my phone like I was dropping next
My gang the coldest, bitch we flyer than a fucking jet

[Hook - Lil Skies]
All I wanted was a million
Gettin money is the greatest feeling
I be with the hoes that look Brazillian
All my niggas jiggy, we be killing
I just want the millions
Stack my bread I wanna see them billions
Fuckboys be mad, caught in they feelings
They hate cause we the villains of the village

[Verse 2 - Neek]
I'm tryna stack a million, so you never catch me chilling
Don't give a fuck about nobodies opinion
He say, she say shit, but I don't ever hear them
Can't fear them, riding with a bad bitch, she steering
Riding by, these niggas mad you could tell by the way they staring
When it comes to me and these niggas, there ain't even no comparing
Yo gang got the city popping, we got them bitches cheering
Every time I step out I be looking like a billion
I be killing, give a fuck about your feelings
Way these niggas copy you would swear they were our children
These niggas swear they rapping but on the real these niggas squealing
I come from a real small town where everybody is drug dealing
I was taught from a real young age, that street shit ain't appealing
Ever since that day I knew I had to make some millions
There's people out here killing, they stealing for the million

[Hook - Lil Skies]
All I wanted was a million
Gettin money is the greatest feeling
I be with the hoes that look Brazillian
All my niggas jiggy, we be killing
I just want the millions
Stack my bread I wanna see them billions
Fuckboys be mad, caught in they feelings
They hate cause we the villains of the village
