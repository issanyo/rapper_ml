[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I get clean, I get clean
Dead fresh, when I dress I leave a crime scene
I be hustlin' all day, I want the green
We celebrate, we roll gelato, pourin' up that lean
I go get the racks and bust it down with the team
I got me some thick fine bitches on my team
I look like a lick, my jewelry look like ice cream
I was just dead broke but now I'm rich just like a dream

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I put that Saint Laurent on, now I'm havin' sweet dreams
Addictive habit, so I chase that money like a fiend
That bitch stay down with me so I bought her a CÃ©line
Gelato, I'm smokin' cookies and that ice cream
Damn you bad, and she shakin' all that and she mean
Damn, I just got a new whip way from overseas
Damn, and my new plug roll the gas like it's trees
Damn man, I'm way up early, I'm still pourin' lean
Damn man, I started gettin' money, they started actin' funny
I knew you wasn't for me, me and cheese like macaroni
I got two bitches they on me, I got V's on me, not lonely
Fresh like Febreze only, hang with VIP's only

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I get clean, I get clean
Dead fresh, when I dress I leave a crime scene
I be hustlin' all day, I want the green
We celebrate, we roll gelato, pourin' up that lean
I go get the racks and bust it down with the team
I got me some thick fine bitches on my team
I look like a lick, my jewelry look like ice cream
I was just dead broke but now I'm rich just like a dream

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
Nigga I was dead broke, murder what I wrote
Me and Pablo on a boat with some bitches blowin' smoke
Out of town spendin' money, I remember I was poor
Say she love you but she don't, she front row at all my shows
Shoes Off-White, t-shirt VLONE
Girl take off that thong, I'ma fuck you to my song
I make all the plays, she know I'm a top dog
Never listened to nobody, learned to be my own boss
Your whole gang lame, swear them niggas Kriss Kross
Got Givenchy on my feet, she got Chanel lipgloss
I don't hang with broke niggas, we gon' spend it, fuck the cost
I'ma grind every day for every time I took a loss
And that's why

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I get clean, I get clean
Dead fresh, when I dress I leave a crime scene
I be hustlin' all day, I want the green
We celebrate, we roll gelato, pourin' up that lean
I go get the racks and bust it down with the team
I got me some thick fine bitches on my team
I look like a lick, my jewelry look like ice cream
I was just dead broke but now I'm rich just like a dream
