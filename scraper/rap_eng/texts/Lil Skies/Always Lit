[Verse 1]
I-I live my life like I'm Gucci
Rolling my drugs it's a movie
Unload the clip out the Uzi
She popped a Xan feelin' groovy
Show me her titties she motivated
I'm off this weed feelin' medicated
We took some time gettin' hella faded
Back in the day she was educated
Back in the day we go to the land
She Tinker Bell I'm her Peter Pan
I-I count the money, she roll my grams
She wanted sex cause she is a fan
Panties and bras on the ceiling fan
She gave me neck didn't use her hands
Backwoods and condoms stuffed in my pants
I know I got it cause I'm the man
Lately I know, I go to places that niggas can't go
I had a girl but that bitch she got old
I'm in my zone so please leave me alone
I got a buzz of the lean I feel slow
Niggas be talkin' I know they be broke
I hustle hard this the life that I chose
Girlfriends get boring and so do these hoes
If I am smoking it's straight out the O
Kush my cologne cause it's all in my clothes
If she a thot than she will be exposed
Kicked her ass out without wearing no clothes
I'm in the hills watchin' y'all from above
I hang with thugs and they all show me love
Ride for my niggas, I'll let off the slugs
And fuck everybody who killin' my buzz, you killin' my buzz

[Hook]
She is a thotty, she movin' her body
She all on my dick, now I'm feelin' so cocky
I look at these niggas and tell them to stop me
I'm always lit it's gon' be hard to find me (Be-be hard to find me)

[Verse 2]
I shine like a diamond I shoot like I'm tommy
My goons right behind me
I did that bitch grimy it was perfect timing
I'm lit like a lighter, my whole life a fire I fuck like a tiger
No Tony the Tiger, to me she a liar
I'm back to my old ways, back to my old ways
She want some foreplay give her that Monday
She comin' back Tuesday, today is a new day
Her diamonds Blu-Ray, she drinkin' the D'Usse
She got on top gave me head like a toupee
Her lingerie gucci, we shootin' the movie, shootin' the movie

[Hook]
She is a thotty, she movin' her body
She all on my dick, now I'm feelin' so cocky
I look at these niggas and tell them to stop me
I'm always lit it's gon' be hard to find me (Be-be hard to find me)
