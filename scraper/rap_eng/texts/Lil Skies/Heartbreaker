Intro:
Yea, yea yea, ooh
WhoisPDP

Hook:
She said I just got to know
Why you acting like a hoe
Wanna keep me on the low
But im lettting people know (know)
Aye that im out here breaking hearts now
Every time I come around they know it's going down
I was in the game these other niggas out of bounds
Don't play victim like ya'll care because I'm not a clown
When they ask me where I been my ass don't make a sound

Verse 1:
All these bitches playing games, I swear I'm not the one
And I'm manning up to all my problems, not the type to run
And I got people on my dick because I got thr funds
My exes getting jealous cause they see what I've become
Long nights hard work this is our year
I lost family to this shit, I didn't shed a tear
And I got ice all on my neck, feel like a chandelier
And when they see I drop a song their faces full of fear
And everybody thinks they know me but they not homies
I can't fuck with you if you just gon act fake amd phoney
Remember days when I ain't have it did it by my lonely
I always stood out momma said no other man could clone me
I was broke chasin' dreams, I had to make my way
I met the plug sold some gas I didn't fuck with yay
And all these niggas claim they hard but sweet like creme brulee
I didn't give a fuck cause they won't say shit to my face
I'm smoking gas, rolling wood to relax my mind
They say im different, paint my vision it just took some time
And you can judge me call me ugly but my money fine
I'm always on some flex shit she see it in my grind
And I don't know where im going, I'm just going through
She the type to say she love you then go fuck the crew
And like right to my face, I find it funny too
She tried to play me like a joke I told her april fools

Verse 2:
On the low, bussin' jugs wit the plug, yea
I like money I like weed in all my drugs, yea
Pull up to the function, bitches giving hugs, yea
I just reminisce, I got it out the mud, yea
Turning up, where my gang? We go hard body
Hit the scene, take it over this is out party
Spanish john, make her wet so she call mr papi
Senorita call bonita giving sloppy toppy
Im like quavo I chase peso, only want dinero
Smoking veggie, roll it up that shit look like an arrow
If I said it then I mean it so she know its real
Boy im shining perfect timing thats without a deal
Breaking hearts chasing dreams see the world different
We was broke made it happen we had no limits
Im a savage im a beast we a e r p to my fucking enemys
