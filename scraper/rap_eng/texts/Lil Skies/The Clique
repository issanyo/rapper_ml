[Intro]
Yeah, I'ma ride or die for the clique
Boy I swear to God that I would die for this shit
That be Maaly Raw

[Chorus]
I'ma ride or die for the clique
Grind with my brothers 'til we make it out the sticks
You a broke nigga, prolly switch up for a bitch
I was in the game, you was sittin' on the bench
Chillin' with my woes like we came up from the 6
I don't fuck with girls that be all up in the mix
Hear he sendin' threats and I ain't even hear the diss
I know I'm the one 'cause I got these niggas pissed
Make the shit look easy, I ain't have to make a wish

[Verse 1]
Ooh, do the dash in the whip
Got a .30 out like Curry, I just aim and I swish
Make her sing like a birdie, she take flights for the dick
Hit her with the long pipe, now she tryna have my kids
Ooh, lil' ho, I'm too legit
Caught up in this fast life, I don't ever wanna quit
You can save the sad stories, I ain't fallin' for that shit
I got diamonds, see me shinin', they all hittin', I don't miss
Ayy, Maaly Raw, we made a hit
Now they see me out in public, run up on me, takin' flicks
Nigga pressed about his shorty, I ain't worried 'bout his bitch
Boy you better get some money 'fore you end up in a ditch

[Verse 2]
Hop in the coupe like oh, yeah
Turn on the radio, yeah
Baby just let me know, yeah
I wanna bank the roll, yeah
I want the guap, the green, yeah
I want the purp, the lean, yeah
She wanna top the team, yeah
That is a thot to me, yeah
I got a Glock, a beam
I live the life you dream
I had to do it myself
'Cause these niggas not for me
These bitches make believe
Play games like hide and seek
I'ma keep bein' myself
'Cause that's how it's meant to be

[Chorus]
I'ma ride or die for the clique
Grind with my brothers 'til we make it out the sticks
You a broke nigga, prolly switch up for a bitch
I was in the game, you was sittin' on the bench
Chillin' with my woes like we came up from the 6
I don't fuck with girls that be all up in the mix
Hear he sendin' threats and I ain't even hear the diss
I know I'm the one 'cause I got these niggas pissed
Make the shit look easy, I ain't have to make a wish

[Outro]
Ayy, yeah I ain't have to make a wish
