CashMoneyAP
Du-du-dun-dun-dun, ayy
Du-du-dun-dun-dun, yeah
Ayy

[Chorus]
You can miss me with that fake shit
How you real but writin' statements?
I’ma change the world, li'l nigga, I'm not basic
Money in my hands, spend it all then I replace it
She know I’m the man, why she in here gettin' naked?
My gang in the buildin', we came up from dirty basements
Nigga try to beef with us, we left him in the pavement
Take a puff and all my feelings go away, I'm painless
Opps want me dead, we gon' hit 'em with the stainless

[Verse 1]
Off a addy pill, I'ma fuck her 'til she brainless
House up in the hills, all of my neighbors are famous
Foreigns in the front, you would think a nigga racing
Crack another blunt, now I’m higher than a spaceship
I ain’t goin' out bad, I’m destined for greatness
Thought you was my mans, now I see you on some lame shit
Not part of the plan, always knew that you were hatin'
Smoke a ton of grams, I'm in love with bein' faded
Stand on top of everything I do, yes, I believe
I set the bar higher, I be workin’ to achieve
There's not too many people out here doin' it like me
My town behind my back, I got these kids chasin' their dreams

[Chorus]
You can miss me with that fake shit
How you real but writin' statements?
I'ma change the world, lil' nigga, I'm not basic
Money in my hands, spend it all then I replace it
She know I'm the man, why she in here gettin' naked?
My gang in the buildin', we came up from dirty basements
Nigga try to beef with us, we left him in the pavement
Take a puff and all my feelings go away, I'm painless
Opps want me dead, we gon' hit 'em with the stainless

[Verse 2]
Where you at? And where you been?
The money changin' all your friends, now you cavin' in
Hard to say, not like it hurts, they can't comprehend
Feel like I been through the worst and they don't understand
Know they want me in the ground with the dirty sand
But it's not happenin'
I know you niggas cappin' when it comes down to this rappin'
My whole life been a savage, never been the one for actin'
Out in Cali, Calabasas, eatin' sushi with a bad bitch
Run my money up, now I'm livin' way better
This exclusive drip, I can wear in any weather
Fly like a bird, why they tryna pluck my feathers?
A band on my shoes and 3000 on a sweater

[Chorus]
You can miss me with that fake shit
How you real but writin' statements?
I'ma change the world, lil' nigga, I'm not basic
Money in my hands, spend it all then I replace it
She know I'm the man, why she in here gettin' naked?
My gang in the buildin', we came up from dirty basements
Nigga try to beef with us, we left him in the pavement
Take a puff and all my feelings go away, I'm painless
Opps want me dead, we gon' hit 'em with the stainless

[Outro]
Opps want me dead, we gon' hit 'em with the stainless
Hi-hit 'em with a stainless
