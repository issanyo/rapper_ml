Lyrics From Snippet

[Chorus]
Ooh, stop the madness
I start all my enemies
They came in tragic
They don't want no smoke with me
I let them have it
She said she won't fuck with me cause I'm a savage
I'm smoking OG straight out the package
You can tell me anything, I'm a savage
Now they think that I'm the king, []
