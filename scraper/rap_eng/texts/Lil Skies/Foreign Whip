[Intro]
Ayy, yeah yeah
Ooh, ayy, yeah yeah
Ayy, I hear you niggas talkin'
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
I hear you niggas talkin' but I never been a bitch
For now I'm in a Honda, soon I'll have a foreign whip
I wake up and check the time, I need some diamonds on my wrist
And I flex by myself, I give a fuck about a bitch

[Verse 1]
What you know about pullin' up stuntin' on your ex
Niggas took me as a joke, now they take me as a threat
I ain't never givin' up because I knew that I was next
Bitches act like they ain't know me now they asking for the sex
When I come to the party everybody goin' wild
Play my song, go berserk, and then I jump into the crowd
If a nigga wanna try me, smoke him like a black and mild
I don't do the rap beef, tell these niggas watch they mouth
Call my brother, how you doin', put some money on his books
Mama told me play sports but I hung out with the crooks
Stay solid when it's scary, we don't do this shit for looks
How you rattin' on your mans, boy I swear these niggas shook
When I come to my shows everybody show me love
And my niggas in the field selling every type of drug
Boy I got it by myself, I give a fuck about a plug
Had to hustle with my brothers, now we up, they show us love

[Chorus]
I hear you niggas talkin' but I never been a bitch
For now I'm in a Honda, soon I'll have a foreign whip
I wake up and check the time, I need some diamonds on my wrist
And I flex by myself, I give a fuck about a bitch
I hear you niggas talkin' but I never been a bitch
For now I'm in a Honda, soon I'll have a foreign whip
I wake up and check the time, I need some diamonds on my wrist
And I flex by myself, I give a fuck about a bitch

[Verse 2]
And I'm rollin' up the woods, feel the gas hit my brain
Girl your boyfriend is a lame, he ain't hanging with the gang
Nigga you don't feel my pain, double cup of purple rain
Boy I shine like Johnny Dang, pimpin' shit like where my cane
And I come from the seven, Chambersburg what I'm reppin'
Hard times had me stressin', I was quick to learn finessin'
I stayed down and count my blessings
That's why I don't come in second
Everybody stay confessin'
Fuck the cops, no I ain't tellin'
Rather see me dead broke with no money in my pocket
Niggas thought I wasn't shit 'til I stepped out, got it poppin'
If I want it I'ma cop it, tell 'em that's just how I'm rockin'
I'm a pilot in the cockpit with some foreigns in the tropics
And I'm the type to hustle, see me grind for my dreams
Need the guap, yeah the cream, get that shit by any means
Swear I pull up make the scene with a bitch you never seen
She a rider for the team, she want diamonds fuck the bling

[Chorus]
I hear you niggas talkin' but I never been a bitch
For now I'm in a Honda, soon I'll have a foreign whip
I wake up and check the time, I need some diamonds on my wrist
And I flex by myself, I give a fuck about a bitch
I hear you niggas talkin' but I never been a bitch
For now I'm in a Honda, soon I'll have a foreign whip
I wake up and check the time, I need some diamonds on my wrist
And I flex by myself, I give a fuck about a bitch
