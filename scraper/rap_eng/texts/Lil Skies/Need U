(Intro)
(aa, Da da da, da da da da da da) Woah
(Da da da da da) Go, go

(Chorus)
Every time I see you, I just know I need you
Maybe I don't need you, maybe I just want you (go, go)
Every time I see you, I just know I need you
Maybe I don’t need you, maybe I just want you

(Verse 1)
Hey trap phone jumping, she in love with the trap
Shawty always held me down when I was falling on my back
Couple racks, smoking pack, kick my feet up and relax
I remember, last September when we travel round the map
Go yachty, spend some bags, she got palettes on her shirt
And my bitch been a thug, smoke a n*gga like some purp
Oh you say you got that work, well me and bae gon' go berserk
I stay loyal to my shawty, cause I know what she worth
2016 shit got different, she got my dick her wish list (oo)
Never do no trippin', if she got a man still hit it (oo)
Always keep my distance, busta pull up like i’m pippin (oo)
Need a Britney like i'm uzi, somebody consistent (oo)

Vlone shawty, go ahead and take your clothes off
We just sippin' lean and smoking woods till we goes off (go ,go)
Backpack rappers always tryna get their flows off
I just need a bitch to fuckin' suck me till I doze off (go)

(Chorus)
Every time I see you, I just know I need you
Maybe I don't need you, maybe I just want you (go ,go)
Every time I see you, I just know I need you
Maybe I don't need you, maybe I just want you (woo, woo)
