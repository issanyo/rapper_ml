[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
Bitch up in the drop (huh)
And I got a straight drop
30 on my Glock, uh
And a bloody face-off
Siamese twins
Suckin' dick, have a taste-off
All my diamonds water
We can have a skate-off (aye)
Push up in the drop (Huh)
And I got a straight drop
30 on my Glock, uh
And a bloody face-off
Siamese twins
Suckin' dick, have a taste-off
All my diamonds water
We can have a skate-off

[Verse: Lil Skies and Yung Bans]
Aye (aye)
Work that thing to perfection (perfection)
Never neglect your message (your message)
Sit back and [glue?] your assets
Take time from all the pressure (from all thepressure)
Know I´mma get what´s destined (destined)
If I don´t see the daylight
My shooters shoot like Stephen
Yeah, know it won't be alright...

...They gon' fuck up yo' life
My diamonds soakin' wet
Just like a water slide
No I don't need no friends
They can go take a hike (aye)

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
Bitch up in the drop (huh)
And I got a straight drop
30 on my Glock...
