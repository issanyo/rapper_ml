Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro]
Menoh
Ayy

[Chorus]
Baby I just like your vi-i-ibe
So I keep you by my si-i-ide
And I know that you gon' ri-i-ide
All my diamonds shinin’ bri-i-ight
And she look me in the eye-eye-eyes
She said baby are you ti-i-ied
I'm not the one to li-i-ie
Start off my haters they can di-i-ie

[Verse 1]
I got too high that's why they notice me, Ayy
And now she know she can’t get over me, Ayy
[], fuck the sober me, Ayy
Backwood where the dope is free
I said the dope is free
