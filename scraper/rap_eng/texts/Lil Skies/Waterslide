[Chorus: Yung Bans]
Ayy, push up in a drop, and I got that straight drop
30 on my Glock, it'll blow your face off
Siamese twins, suck the dick, have a taste off
All my diamonds water, nigga, we can have a skate off
Ayy, push up in a drop, and I got that straight drop
30 on my Glock, it'll blow your face off
Siamese twins, suck the dick, have a taste off
All my diamonds water, nigga, we can have a skate off

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Ayy, work that thing to perfection
Never neglect your message, sit back, enjoy your assets
Take time from all the pressure, know I'ma get what's destined
If I don't see the daylight, my shooters shoot like Stephen
Yeah, know it will be alright
You gotta do your thing, they gon' fuck up your life
My diamonds soakin' wet, just like a waterslide
No, I don't need no friends, they can go take a hike

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
Ayy, push up in a drop, and I got that straight drop
30 on my Glock, it'll blow your face off
Siamese twins, suck the dick, have a taste off
All my diamonds water, nigga, we can have a skate off
Ayy, push up in a drop, and I got that straight drop
30 on my Glock, it'll blow your face off
Siamese twins, suck the dick, have a taste off
All my diamonds water, nigga, we can have a skate off

[Verse 2: Yung Bans]
All my pockets full, all my jeans saggin'
Walk inside the bank, give it up and a bad bitch
I was out here juggin', hittin' licks 'cause I ain't had shit
Mama out here workin' day and night to spend her last cent
I apologize for always bein' a bad kid
Ridin' 'round with that ratchet, stretch a nigga, elastic (Ayy)
Jewelry fake like plastic, ran off and we snatch it (Ayy)
Disappear like magic, true story, no rappin'

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
Push up in a drop, and I got that straight drop
30 on my Glock, it'll blow your face off
Siamese twins, suck the dick, have a taste off
All my diamonds water, nigga, we can have a skate off
Ayy, push up in a drop, and I got that straight drop
30 on my Glock, it'll blow your face off
Siamese twins, suck the dick, have a taste off
All my diamonds water, nigga, we can have a skate off
