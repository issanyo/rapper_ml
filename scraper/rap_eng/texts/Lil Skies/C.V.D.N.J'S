Cons, Vans, DC's, Nike's, gotta get my J's on
Cons, Vans, DC's, Nike's, gotta get my J's on
Cons, Vans, DC's, Nike's, gotta get my J's on
Gotta get my J's on, gotta get my J's on

[Verse 1]
Getting paid, you Minute Maid
My shoes fresh bought like lemonade
Two pairs of Vans, three pair of J's
I'm known around for my shoe game
These other dudes, they too lame
Kicks from Japan, they too strange
Two white girls that go insane
That fast life, I'm switching lanes
I talk a lot cause I swag a lot
We 30 deep in the parking lot
Jean jackets and snapbacks
These ratchet women just hit the spot
Walking in Zumiez, they now the name
Haven't blown up, I got the fame
Hating on me dog, I am not to blame
Don't compare me dog, I'm not the same
Dope shirts and fresh shoes
Bad woman, that's good news
Got my own style, I pick and choose
We win so much, y'all always lose
If this song is just magic
Any beat I'll trash it
These rappers in the DMV are dead
Now bring them caskets boy

[Chorus]
Lace 'em up, Machine Gun Kelly
I am fresher than some veggies
There ain't nothing you can tell
Wipe me down like you wiping off a Bentley
I'ma go and hit up Zumiez
Watch me spend a couple centuries

Cons, Vans, DC's, Nike's, gotta get my J's on
Gotta get my J's on, gotta get my J's on

[Verse 2]
Man this house party straight bumping
Everybody straight stunting
I'm turnt up to the max, brother you can't tell me nothing
See we flexing hard like every day
Women love my crew in every way
Hater talk but the talk fades away
Everybody got their hands up screaming "Hey!"
Money making, booty shaking
Living life feeling like I'm famous
I told you once, ain't gonnaa tell you twice
Lil Skies is just really bound to make it
But forget the paper, I'm wearing Taylors
Laughing to the store while I see them haters
No new friends so forget the fakers
We balling like Spalding and the Lakers
See I'ma go and get it
Been working all of my life and my work is never finished
I'ma keep on grinding cause the grind is always endless
With my head up to the sky because the sky is the limit
Watch me get it boy

[Chorus]
Lace 'em up, Machine Gun Kelly
I am fresher than some veggies
There ain't nothing you can tell
Wipe me down like you wiping off a Bentley
I'ma go and hit up Zumiez
Watch me spend a couple centuries

Gotta get my J's on, gotta get my J's on
