[Intro]
Yeah (Yeah)
People knowin' that we lit (Yeah), nigga
They knowin' that we lit (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Money comin' in, people knowin' that we lit
Do it for the fam, we gon' die for this shit
It's some real ties when we pull up with the clique
It ain't no surprise, they gon' love you when you rich
Money comin' in, people knowin' that we lit
Do it for the fam, we gon' die for this shit
It's some real ties when we pull up with the clique
It ain't no surprise, they all love you when you rich

[Verse 1]
Lil' nigga, I got my weight up
Flexin' on the competition who tried to play us
Now we on, you niggas just gotta pay up
And I ain't done, I'm ballin' like I hit layups
Switch flows, switch cars, I switch hoes
My shit goes, I'm whippin' the pot like Crisco
These diamonds on me, just dancin' like we at the disco
No red light, you hear the shots, come and get low, 'cause

[Chorus]
Money comin' in, people knowin' that we lit
Do it for the fam, we gon' die for this shit
It's some real ties when we pull up with the clique
It ain't no surprise, they gon' love you when you rich
Money comin' in, people knowin' that we lit
Do it for the fam, we gon' die for this shit
It's some real ties when we pull up with the clique
It ain't no surprise, they all love you when you rich

[Verse 2]
Rich, rich as a bitch
Money comin' in, my pocket Lilo and Stitch (Yeah)
Flooded the Patek, you see it shine on my wrist (Yeah)
To think I was a mess, to living my life like this (Yeah)
Put her in Chanel, she takin' flights on a trip (Yeah)
I turn up at my show, get the backend then I dip (Yeah)
You never really know when somebody gonna switch (Yeah)
It's loyalty and trust, I don't be caught in the mix, 'cause

[Chorus]
Money comin' in, people knowin' that we lit
Do it for the fam, we gon' die for this shit
It's some real ties when we pull up with the clique
It ain't no surprise, they gon' love you when you rich
Money comin' in, people knowin' that we lit
Do it for the fam, we gon' die for this shit
It's some real ties when we pull up with the clique
It ain't no surprise, they all love you when you rich
