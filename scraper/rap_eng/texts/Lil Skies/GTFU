[Intro: C-Trox]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woo

[Chorus: C-Trox]
Call my homie on the phone, he's like "What up?"
You know what I'm tryna do, I wanna turn up
Then he told me he been smoking, they just rolled up
But I'm not in the mood to sit and chill so get the fuck up

[Verse 1: C-Trox]
Get your blackout, go stupid
Been thinking about boozing, yeah
Don't photo shirt, no chill
I think I'm gon' lose him, yeah
Double shot of the vodka, yeah
Need a drumstick, boy, I got 'em, yeah
Open your crib, I'm a problem
Overly confident thinking I'm awesome, yeah
What you don't know, I'm a po-po at the table, I'm like Steph Curry
Splash bros all night until I'm not able, my vision's too blurry
Man, I might be too lit, yeah, I might be too lit, I'm too lit again
While we work out this and do this again
I pass out in the pool and wake up in my friends
Two girls want a threesome, you can count me in, yeah
Text more, said "Come through," but that's for my friends, yeah
I know you're just learning, bruh
You sat on Snapchat, I was turning up
Next time I see you, I'm gon' say "What's up?"
But that bitch one pumps, so pay it up

[Chorus: C-Trox]
Call my homie on the phone, he's like "What up?"
You know what I'm tryna do, I wanna turn up
Then he told me he been smoking, they just rolled up
But I'm not in the mood to sit and chill so get the fuck up

[Post-Chorus: C-Trox]
Yeah, get the fuck up
Yeah, so get the fuck up
Yeah, so get the fuck up
'Cause I'm not in the mood to sit and chill so get the fuck up

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
Step up in this bitch, it's about to get lit
Walk in the party, which room will I hit?
Turned up in this bitch like an on light switch
Can't miss, too lit, sign my name on her tits
Oh my, he's fly
Baby, I go by the name Lil Skies
Step in the building with all my guys
Don't drink a lot but I do stay fly
Now she drinkin' Bacardi, actin' so naughty
Look at how she movin' her body
My bitch still look like a Barbie, twerkin' retard-y
She be turnin' up the party
Me, I ja-ball like Jabari
I stay for one night, then I leave like, "I'm sorry"
I do not care about these hoes, I sell mommies
I rather go out with my bros then get body, yeah
Bitch, we be having fun
Drunk in the club, I do what I want
Shawty don't front, your friends wanna fuck
And we gon' pull up, just hop in the trunk
Got some white girls, they love doin' drugs
Make a phone call like, "Where is the plug?"
Don't hit my phone, my cover is up
I pulled up outside like, "Get the fuck up"

[Chorus: C-Trox]
Call my homie on the phone, he's like "What up?"
You know what I'm tryna do, I wanna turn up
Then he told me he been smoking, they just rolled up
But I'm not in the mood to sit and chill so get the fuck up

[Post-Chorus: C-Trox]
Yeah, get the fuck up
Yeah, so get the fuck up
Yeah, so get the fuck up
'Cause I'm not in the mood to sit and chill so get the fuck up
