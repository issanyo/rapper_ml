[Intro: Yung Pinch]
Beach boy in this ho
Watch as I step on the scene
This how we living, no actin' (This how we living, no actin')
I got her wet in her dreams (I got her wet in her dreams)
I think she ready for action
Think she ready for

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Watch as I step on the scene
This how we living, no actin'
Got her wet in her dreams
I think she ready for action
Ain't no lock on the door
She drop the top to the floor
There ain't no stopping us now
If somebody knock let me know
I'm taking you down
Slaying you now
She say she want me
She love to taunt me, yeah

[Verse 1: Yung Pinch]
Nightmares of you and I still haunt me
Long nights and a lotta spilled coffee (I don't miss it)
Yeah, I'm kissin' all those good days bye bye
Forget my name, forget the code to my wifi
Woah, I'm going stacked to the dance with a bag in my pants
Yeah, you had your last chance, yeah
Yeah
Now you sad 'cause I'm gone
Mad 'cause I'm on
And I'm glad to be fearless, of course it had to be me
It's scientifically proven, you took a toll on me (Took a toll on me)
I can't believe my homies fuckin' told on me (Fuckin' told on me)
Oh yeah, I did it, you knew it
Go 'head and cry about that (Go 'head and cry about that)
I admit it, I'm stupid
And I won't lie about that
But after all this
I'm okay, though
No way to stop me when you're this far gone
Catch a plane and find me, I'm the next flight on

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Watch as I step on the scene
This how we living, no actin'
Got her wet in her dreams
I think she ready for action
Ain't no lock on the door
She drop the top to the floor
There ain't no stopping us now
If somebody knock let me know
I'm taking you down
Slaying you now
She say she want me
She love to taunt me, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
I never post what I do
I really live what I'm rapping
She gon' tell you to wait
For me it's lights, camera, action
I hop right off the plane
I stash my racks in the mattress
I came in through the back and I still leave with my backend
Shawty turned this dream to a nightmare
You see me bossed up and you think it's not fair
I don't wanna hear your side 'cause I don't care
You jealous 'cause I went and felt the tension in the air
All the times I lost I could never get back
I will never tell lies, I shall only speak facts
Man, you said that you would ride but you left me on the flat
I stayed by your side even when I'm 'cross the map
Don't put blame on me
A lotta people hatin' on me
But you know I'm strong
I'm built for this shit
Step on the scene fly
It's Skies and Yung Pinch, you lil' bitch

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Watch as I step on the scene
This how we living, no actin'
Got her wet in her dreams
I think she ready for action
Ain't no lock on the door
She drop the top to the floor
There ain't no stopping us now
If somebody knock let me know
I'm taking you down
Slaying you now
She say she want me
She love to taunt me, yeah
