Snippet of lyrics

[Verse]
Before i scrape my plate, make sure I say my grace
Tryna see bright of day, my life be full of gray
No Fifty Shades of Gray, you sweet like creme brûlée
They tryna steal my swag, they tryna steal my sauce
I had to take a loss, that shit made me a boss
This journey took same time, we put in overtime
Make sure my brothers grind, so all my brothers shine
And they want me to fall, but I remain the same
I'd die for my bros, and that’ll never change

[Chorus]
You switched up for some hoes, but say you're with the game
I gotta keep my distance, ain't fucking with you lames
Got an expensive bitch, she like expensive shit
Is this the life you want, I’m tryna make you rich
I came up from the ditch, I like expensive shit
Got an expensive chick, she like expensive shit
Got an expensive bitch, she like expensive shit
Is this the life you want, I'm tryna make you rich
I came up from the ditch, I like expensive shit
Got an expensive chick, she like expensive shit

[Verse]
I'll let you drive my car, make sure you drive it fast
We smoking please don't crash, the cops be on my ass
Oh, you gon' do the dash, nigga what you want
My nigga, what you want, you dont wanna front
Rolling up the wood, that's the stuffed crust
She said she fell in love, I thing we fell in lust
No I don't give no fucks, I been ‘bout my bucks
You know it's hard to trust, they want me to fuck up
That’s why I get so high, I’m working in my zone
What's real is hard to clone, my heart made out of stone
Put my life in these beats, make sure I bring the heat
They gon’ jump out they cheats, I'm building memories
‘Cause they want me to fall, but I remain the same
And I'd die for my bros, and that will never change

[Chorus]
You switched up for some hoes, but say you're with the game
I gotta keep my distance, ain’t fucking with you lames
Got an expensive bitch, she like expensive shit
Is this the life you want, I'm tryna make you rich
I came up from the ditch, I like expensive shit
Got an expensive chick, she like expensive shit
Got an expensive bitch, she like expensive shit
Is this the life you want, I'm tryna make you rich
I came up from the ditch, I like expensive shit
Got an expensive chick, she like expensive shit
