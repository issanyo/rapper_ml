[Intro]
Yeah, ayy
Menoh!
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Wrists, dancing, sink your ship, Titanic
My clique full of bandits, grind for that lettuce sandwich
The coupe, it's tinted, she thought it was rented
I want it, I'ma spend it, live my life with no limits
I'ma do the damage, I'ma do the damage
I'ma do the damage, bitch I'ma do the damage
Know I'ma do the damage, just know I'm taking credit
I said it then I meant it, man, 'cause I'm so relentless

[Verse 1]
You want to hang with a rockstar, live a fast life and get high
We 'gon come through, shut the block down
Make 'em lay low like drive-byes
I don't fuck with them, they don't fuck with me
It gets to their heads but not mines
I'm my own man, I don't need no hands
Who go switch with me and change sides
Woah, it's lit, milk the game like a tit
I put my bitch in Rick, now she 'gon ride this dick
My gang, official, no, you don't want this issue
Blast off hard like a missle, real diamonds these aren't crystals
Lil' shawty, go crazy, pull up in black Mercedes
Thank god my momma made me, boy, you's a momma's baby
The throne was set for taking, I press reset on patience
The Percs makes her amazing, soak it up like a raisin

[Chorus]
Wrists, dancing, sink your ship, Titanic
My clique full of bandits, grind for that lettuce sandwich
The coupe, is tinted, she thought it was rented
I want it, I'ma spend it, live my life with no limits
I'ma do the damage, I'ma do the damage
I'ma do the damage, bitch, I'ma do the damage
Know I'ma do the damage, just know I'm taking credit
I said it then I meant it, man, 'cause I'm so relentless

[Verse 2]
Senorita, she a eater, my bitch a queen like Latifah
Roll ten woods of that reefer, smoke KK Wiz Khalifa
Got music blastin' through my speakers
In the game you was on the bleachers
I don't text her back, I don't need her
You really thought she was a keeper
Woah, not sorry, flexed up with my posse
Tattoos all on my body, diamonds is playing hockey
Cold, brr, let me go up her skirt, Louis V on her purse
Sunday she go to church, she fragile, but worth it
I know nobody perfect, not lying in my verses
Take credit like a merchant
Yeah, Immortal, bandit, bitch I'm not from this planet
I need that lettuce sandwich, don't think they understand it

[Chorus]
Wrists, dancing, sink your ship, Titanic
My clique full of bandits, grind for that lettuce sandwich
The coupe, is tinted, she thought it was rented
I want it, I'ma spend it, live my life with no limits
I'ma do the damage, I'ma do the damage
I'ma do the damage, bitch I'ma do the damage
Know I'ma do the damage, just know I'm taking credit
I said it then I meant it, man, 'cause I'm so relentless
