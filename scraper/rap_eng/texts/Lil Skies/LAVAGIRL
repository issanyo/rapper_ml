[Chorus: Sprite Lee]
And I've been up all night sweating in my dreams
Come and rescue me
I've had way too much of my Hennessy
And now I can't sleep
I thought I'd die
And yet I'm caught in your high tide
No, no, no

[Verse 1: Sprite Lee]
I've been up all night
I can't run away when they're on my mind
Got me caught in the rain where the sun don't shine
I know you wanna play, hop on my ride
I know youâ€™ll ride it for days, then you'll take my Sprite
Never wanted to chase, but you love to hide
Had to throw it away, lay to waste outside, yeah
I get a taste, I'm high
I get a taste, and I'm high
Just step on over to my side
We push and pull like a high tide
Girl, hold me down, you're my lifeline
I'm sweating, I can't lay down
You got me going insane now
No, no, no

[Chorus: Sprite Lee]
And I've been up all night sweating in my dreams
Come and rescue me
I've had way too much of my Hennessy
And now I can't sleep
I thought I'd die
And yet I'm caught in your high tide
No, no, no

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
Aye, rockstars getting high
Ask me how I do it, like I'm not afraid of heights
My dreams nightmares, this shit feel like real life
All she wanna do is party, she don't wanna sit tight
Outta town making plays, I was caught up in the moment
Ashed the wood in the tray, mix my cup with the components
Oh, oh, baby girl we putting on a show, oh
Something about her, I can't let her go, oh

[Bridge: Lil Skies]
Aye, aye, fell asleep and I thought I died
Said you were right, but you're never right
You can miss me with the fake cries
Fell asleep and I thought I died
Said you were right, but you're never right
You can miss me with the fake cries

[Chorus: Sprite Lee]
And I've been up all night sweating in my dreams
Come and rescue me
I hit way too much of my Hennessy
And now I can't sleep
I thought I'd die
And yet I'm caught in your high tide
No, no, no
