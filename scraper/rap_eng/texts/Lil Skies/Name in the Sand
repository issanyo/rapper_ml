[Intro]
Love, need your love
Menoh
Need your love

[Chorus]
Need your love, it's my drug
When I'm down, lift me up
That's eno-ough (That's eno-ough)
That's eno-ough (That's eno-ough)
When it rains, grab my hand
Spell your name in the sand
It's no ru-ush (It's no ru-ush)
It's no ru-ush (It's no ru-ush)

[Verse 1]
If I die, would you cry?
Shed black tears from your eyes
That make up (That make up)
That make up (That make up)
This for life, no more games
Feel the vibe through your pain
You're so clutch (You're so clutch)
Fuck me up (Fuck me up)
Me and you, Bonnie Clyde
We gon' ride to survive
No breaku-ups (No breaku-ups)
No breaku-ups (No breaku-ups)

[Chorus]
Need your love, it's my drug
When I'm down, lift me up
That's eno-ough (That's eno-ough)
That's eno-ough (That's eno-ough)
When it rains, grab my hand
Spell your name in the sand
It's no ru-ush (It's no ru-ush)
It's no ru-ush

[Verse 2]
You take my heart and say you love me, are you the one I should really trust?
Said I would stop, but I go right back to this double cup
Wood after wood, I take a puff, can barely feel my lungs
You gotta move on from the past and show yourself you're strong
I ain't tryna preach too much, I'm tryna let you know (Tryna let you know)
I would give the world to you if you would let us grow (You would let us grow)
Good vibes, good times everywhere we go (Everywhere we go)
Turn the music up, she hear me on the radio (On the radio)
Backroads on the east side, yeah
With my baby getting so high, everything is alright
We be stuntin' so fly
Know that we gon' catch a eye when we walk by, but they know she all mine
Nigga, yeah, she's all mine

[Chorus]
Need your love, it's my drug
When I'm down, lift me up
That's eno-ough (That's eno-ough)
That's eno-ough (That's eno-ough)
When it rains, grab my hand
Spell your name in the sand
It's no ru-ush (It's no ru-ush)
It's no ru-ush (It's no ru-ush)
