[Intro]
I, I, I, I, I, I

[Chorus]
Wanna make it with the people that was there from the start
I don't need no new people, they gon' tear me apart
You can't shine with me now, you left me stuck in the dark
Strictly business nowadays, I got no time for your heart
Wanna make it with the people that was there from the start
I don't need no new people, they gon' tear me apart
You can't shine with me now, you left me stuck in the dark
Strictly business nowadays, I got no time for your heart

[Verse 1]
Runnin' bands up with my bros, we be gettin' the dough
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes, keep my head on my goals
We was ridin' down the street makin' plays at the post
I can't even sit and count all the grams that I sold
Young nigga made a way, now they hate that we win
Try to stop me, I ain't cocky, you ain't boxin' me in
I got bitches say they love me and they still got a man
I stay focused, never fold, this shit a part of my plan

[Chorus]
I wanna make it with the people that was there from the start
I don't need no new people, they gon' tear me apart
You can't shine with me now, you left me stuck in the dark
Strictly business nowadays, I got no time for your heart
Wanna make it with the people that was there from the start
I don't need no new people, they gon' tear me apart
You can't shine with me now, you left me stuck in the dark
Strictly business nowadays, I got no time for your heart

[Verse 2]
I made my own wave, I'm with your boo thang
She havin' mood swings, she need a mood ring
A boss, she know I be, so run it up with me
I got the recipe, make you hit melodies
Get high and feel the breeze, I know it's feelin' nice
You wanna live this life because it's feelin' right
And when I'm feelin' down, will you still be around?
Or will you shut me down? Grab the gun and load a round

[Chorus]
I wanna make it with the people that was there from the start
I don't need no new people, they gon' tear me apart
You can't shine with me now, you left me stuck in the dark
Strictly business nowadays, I got no time for your heart
Wanna make it with the people that was there from the start
I don't need no new people, they gon' tear me apart
You can't shine with me now, you left me stuck in the dark
Strictly business nowadays, I got no time for your heart

[Outro]
Ayy, ayy, I got no time for your heart, yeah
I got no time for your heart, yeah
I got no time for your heart
Gotta, uh, ayy
I got no time for your heart, yeah
I got no time for your heart, yeah
I got no time for your heart, yeah
I got no time for your heart, yeah
