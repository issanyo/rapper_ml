[Verse 1]
Look, niggas hatin' on me I'm just trying to make a way
My bible and my demons make me pray for better days
Dark liquor, cigarettes, and some purple sprite
My life's a gamble, roll the dice, I had to pay the price
Cold hands, foreign bitches doin' slow dance
She a freak but I don't like the way she romance
Poppin' pills, catching chills from these xanny pills
Shawtey say she get a thrill, love the way it feels

[Hook]
Sippin' forties, rollin' doobies, man my life's a movie
I fucked a groupie, got the nudies, handprints on her booty
And niggas say I'm actin' different boy you never knew me
And bitches say I'm actin' different but you never knew me
Sippin' forties, rollin' doobies, man my life's a movie
I fucked a groupie, got the nudies, handprints on her booty
And niggas say I'm actin' different boy you never knew me
And bitches say I'm actin' different but you never knew me (huh)
Let me light another newport, dinner by the food court, ballin' I need two courts (huh)
Let me light another newport, dinner by the food court, ballin' I need two courts (huh)
Cigarettes, and henny bottles (yuh)
Cigarettes, and henny bottles (yuh)
Cigarettes, and henny bottles (woah)
Ciga... woah

[Verse 2]
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, menace like I'm Dennis
Lil Skies I'm in it, want green I'm talkin' spinach
See this is the beginning, the story that I'm livin'
I'm makin' bad decisions, still in my mind I'm gifted
I come from Chillenburg, crack needles on the curb
My niggas servin' herb, cops come don't say a word
This is the life I chose, I'm juggin' with my bros
And we don't love these hoes, they all about that dough
And she use me to get high but that ain't catch me by surprise
Used to hide her from my guys 'cause she was always tellin' lies
And the way she rolled a blunt bro she had me mesmerized
Used to look into her eyes and thank God she was mine
Now I'm smokin' good livin' great, took some time to concentrate
Rollin' up, takin' flights, Superman without his cape
Pourin' up, double cups, gettin' rich and buy some bape
Yuh, imma get rich and buy some bape

[Outro]
Until we end, until we fall, imma keep it real, girl I just want it all
Until we end, until we fall, imma keep it real, girl I just want it all
Until we end, until we fall, imma keep it real, girl I just want it all

Gold diggers and a bunch of broke niggas
I took some time to realize I was a born sinner
Now wash my hands before I sit and thank God for dinner
I know my heart is cold but it's shining like some spinnas
I told myself that I would make it if I stopped gettin' faded
Screamin' fuck my education boy I'm on my way to greatness
Victim of the slave ship, work harder for a better payment
Trying to find my placement in a world full of basic

Until we end, until we fall, imma keep it real, girl I just want it all
Until we end
