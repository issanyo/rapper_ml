[Intro]
Yeah yeah, ooh ayy
Man I just woke up like fuck it
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Wake up getting this cake
Oh she love me, no I can't relate
And they hate me cause I made a way
If you try me, I go where you stay
With my brothers pull up to the land
She gon' see me and fuck for the bands
I can't love you cause you is a fan
See me dancing, that's my money dance
I'm Italian, my shorty from France
I'm in Cali just getting a tan
Say she love me but follow my mans
Shawty high must be off of the xans
Say I rock and play her like a band
Just relax shawty hear what I'm saying
I got brothers like it's taliban
It's a party, bring you and your friends
Need a coupe but my bro want a benz
Fuck her sister, I thought they was twins
Fuck it, I'll probably do it again
Count my blessings, wake up, and I sin
I sip Henny, can't fuck with the gin
Sending shots, he won't aim for the rim
Sending shots, he won't aim for my brim
He a loser, I know he can't win
In all black and my car got the tint
Everyday I wake up and get bent
My life's crazy but I don't repent
Say he loyal, I know he gon' switch
Nigga either you real or a bitch
You a actor, just wanna be Mitch
Life's a game and my TV don't glitch
Rolling up watching Lilo and Stitch
I got juice and my shawty do too
She a rider, get high in my coupe
And I know niggas hate how I move
They be jealous and that is the truth
Boy I know I don't got shit to prove
She got blues, I ain't giving her clues
Pay attention, don't step on my shoes
I got swagger, don't mean to be rude

[Hook]
What, bitch I don't mean to be rude
I got this ice on my jewels
And I know niggas hate how I move
Oh that nigga he say he a goon
She gon' fuck me, she like how I cool
And my diamonds be wet like a pool
And I know I can't fall for no fool
What, what
Bitch I don't mean to be rude
I got this ice on my jewels
And I know niggas hate how I move
Oh that nigga he say he a goon
She gon' fuck me, she like how I cool
And my diamonds be wet like a pool
And I know I can't fall for no fool

[Verse 2]
Ayy, she wanna go to a party
She feeling good off the molly
She getting right off Bacardi
And now this girl acting so naughty
And I got my hands on her body
And she ride me, she feeling so jolly
And she know that these niggas can't stop me
I'm too humble for me to be cocky
I got a hoe up in aki
I got a hoe out the way
All these bitches be all in my face
Probably why they're easy to replace
Call my lawyer, I'm beating the case
I'm a loner, be needing my space
And these niggas want all of my plays
And these bitches be stuck in their ways
On my soul I don't talk to the jakes
You a rat then you hang with the snakes
Niggas change when they come to the cake
Say they down but they really be fake
Tell my brothers I got 'em always
We was trapping in all the hallways
And we had to learn the hard way
And my life they wanna take it away
I got your ho on a J, yaa
She be giving me neck, yaa
All of these bitches be pressed, yaa
I am not giving 'em checks, nah
She wanna ride for the set
And damn I hate when she upset
And she wanna make up with the sex
They some rookies, come fuck with a vet

[Hook]
What, bitch I don't mean to be rude
I got this ice on my jewels
And I know niggas hate how I move
Oh that nigga he say he a goon
She gon' fuck me, she like how I cool
And my diamonds be wet like a pool
And I know I can't fall for no fool
What, aye
Bitch I don't mean to be rude
I got this ice on my jewels
And I know niggas hate how I move
Oh that nigga he say he a goon
She gon' fuck me, she like how I cool
And my diamonds be wet like a pool
And I know I can't fall for no fool, ayy
