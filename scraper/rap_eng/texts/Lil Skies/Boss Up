[Verse 1]
Bossed up, I'm gettin' mines, I'm only in my prime
They tried to take my shine, I left them niggas blind
She say she fuck with me, it's hard to tell what's real
And I just popped an Addy, that shit gave me the chills
Dark life up in the Hills, go buffalo for bills
I fucked her for the thrill, girl, I won't pay your bills
I'm not these other dudes, don't hang with april fools
And if he bust a move, he might just make the news, yeah
Hopped up in the coupe, yeah, smokin' like I'm Snoop, yeah
Not for everybody, so tell 'em play it cool, yeah
These designer jeans, Jordan 1s for my shoes, yeah
Broski got a gun, you run up, he gon' shoot, yeah
Ballin' like a hoop, yeah, so cold I need a suit, yeah
My brother, that's my troop, yeah, try us, we gettin' loose, yeah
You live a fantasy, must have forgot the truth
I had to do the math, and I was smokin' boof
Ayy, must have forgot the truth
I had to do the math, and I was smokin' boof
Know they don't have a clue, we jumped up on the roof
And I was on my way to greatness, nigga, where were you?

[Chorus]
And she gon' fuck with me, she like the way I live
Niggas hate all the time, I got no fuck to give
Lil' nigga speak your mind, why you still bein' stiff?
Know it's the perfect time, yeah they know what it is
And she gon' fuck with me, she like the way I live
Niggas hate all the time, I got no fuck to give
Lil' nigga speak your mind, why you still bein' stiff?
Know it's the perfect time, yeah they know what it is
