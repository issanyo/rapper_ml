[Intro]
I think I might be happy
Yea, yea aight, look look, look look

[Verse 1]
Flexin I feel like T-rex
Me I step out like a vet my goons leave you wet
No I will not show respect
Honestly cut to the check, your bitch gave me neck
That bitch go crazy foreal
White bitch she kill it like bill, she drillin no squeal
He claim he real I can't tell
All of these niggas be lying I just want a mil
Fuck all your morals don't care how you feel
[?] are you signing you don't got a deal
I'm independent I just love the thrill
I smoked some gas now my mind got the chills
Call up my plug he got some sour d
Put my mans on now he good in the streets
Honestly all of my niggas gon eat
I am a beast and I'm fresh off the leash
Bang like finito pull up with my gang
John see a opp then he taking his chain
Fuck all them questions I don't know a thing
Niggas be snitchin don't let out my name
Nobody knows they ain't feelin my pain
Been through some rain so I smoke on propane
2016 and that thot didn't change
She say she love me and I don't feel the same
We bust the joogs on the low
Me I just couldn't go broke I had to get low
Me I just smoke on the dope
Look at that bitch like you already know
I been that nigga since I could remember
Live what i'm rappin you just a pretender
Diamonds so cold I bought them in november
She fuck with me cause she know I'm a winner

[Hook]
My niggas struggled now we love to hustle, I'm flexin on niggas I might pop a muscle, ahead of my business I feel like I'm russel
Bitch I feel like I'm russel
My niggas struggled now we love to hustle, I'm flexin on niggas I might pop a muscle, ahead of my business I feel like I'm russel
Bitch I feel like I'm russel

[Verse 2]
I'm like oh man, oh man hit the slow dance
We ain't gotta romance we ain't gotta hold hands
Niggas quick to speak about what they don't know
Shawty quick to give me brain like she honor roll
Young nigga and i'm from chillinburg what's the word might pull up then (skrt skrt)
Been the realest nigga since birth I could show you how to do it but you know you gotta put in some work
Bitch I been hungry since 1998
I ain't never been a fake, I worked hard to be a great
Niggas in they feelings they be acting like they drake
I can never hesitate when it comes to the cake
I always been humble you can see it in my face
Used to pray for better days now I'm running relay
Around everybody out here acting cliche
I've been ballin on these niggas dunking like I'm MJ
I jumped in the water and I swam with the sharks
Momma told me stay inside I went out after dark
Kept a couple niggas with me riding by my side
I just want to get high, stack money, stay fly
Boy you know it's going down
Boy you know it's going down
Tell her that I need her right now
The industry full of fake smiles, everybody run they mouths when you ain't around they some fuckin clowns

[Hook]
My niggas struggled now we love to hustle, I'm flexin on niggas I might pop a muscle, ahead of my business I feel like I'm russel
Bitch I feel like I'm russel
My niggas struggled now we love to hustle, I'm flexin on niggas I might pop a muscle, ahead of my business I feel like I'm russel
Bitch I feel like I'm russel
