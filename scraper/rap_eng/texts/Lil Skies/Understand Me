[Intro]
Ay, I said do you understand me (Yeah)
Do you under (Ay)
I don't think you understand me
Imma get these millions for my family
And I was trapping riding round in a (Ay)
And I was (Ay, ay, ay)

[Chorus]
I don't think you understand me
Imma get these millions for my family
I was trapping riding round in a Camry
I need a Bentley fuck a friend no I'm not friendly
Tell me you got me but I know you just pretending
Imma get these millions for my family
I was trapping riding round in a camri
I need a Bentley fuck a friend no I'm not friendly
Tell me you got me but I know you just pretending

[Verse]
Oh yes going down they see me turning up
Get that bag and lay low I don't know who to trust
I had nothing now for fun I like to run it up
I'm tatted on my face I beat myself don't give a fuck
And I stay down even when them hoes don't show me love
That nigga flexing with no money guess he thought he was
I was driving down the street I had to meet the plug
I'm at the crib smoking pack cuz I don't do the club
Let her roll my Backwood, she want the lavish life
I just bought a pint of lean so lemme grab a sprite
In the cloud with the stars like I'm taking flight
Up all night working hard tryna find the light
Lifes a gamble when its ready gotta roll the dice
Now if I like it imma cop screaming fuck the price
Cops lock my brother up they tryna give him life

[Chorus]
I don't think you understand me
Imma get these millions for my family
I was trapping riding round in a camri
I need a Bentley fuck a friend no I'm not friendly
Tell me you got me but I know you just pretending
Imma get these millions for my family
I was trapping riding round in a camri
I need a Bentley fuck a friend no I'm not friendly
Tell me you got me but I know you just pretending

[Verse]
Waking up chasing money its a new day
These niggas fake I see right through them like its Blu-ray
And I aint never paid attention to what people say
When you don't have it you gon get it so I made a way
In the field like a quarterback was making plays
Three seconds left I'm shooting I aint fade away
I'm serious about my art you see it in my face
I put my money in my craft now watch me elevate

[Pre-Chorus]
But do you understand me (Yeah)
I said do you understand me (No)
I said do you under (Ay)
And I don't think they understand me
Imma really go and get a grammy
Imma imma imma do this for my family
And you on me when you know I got a

[Chorus]
I don't think you understand me
Imma get these millions for my family
I was trapping riding round in a camri
I need a Bentley fuck a friend no I'm not friendly
Tell me you got me but I know you just pretending
Imma get these millions for my family
I was trapping riding round in a camri
I need a Bentley fuck a friend no I'm not friendly
Tell me you got me but I know you just pretending

[Outro]
Nigga why you just pretending
Shawty why you just pretending
All of these people be pretending
And I don't think they understand me
No, no they don't understand me
