[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
They come around me, they come around me
I don't ever doubt it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Paranoia (paranoia), yeah yeah
I can't never be there for ya, yeah yeah
But I'ma pull up on ya, yeah yeah
Just to show you that I love ya
I walk outside, throw my hands to the sky (to the sky)
Let my heart spill, I know you can hear my cries (hear my cries)
Demons in my eyes, seen them hiding in disguise (in disguise)
Yeah, paranoia for my life, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I walk outside
I just caught the wave, seen attention in their eyes
Flying like an owl, I stay confident and wise
Smoking all the time just to hide my bad side
Mama said that she gon'-gon' pray for me, but I know how that goes
I spent too much time around fake niggas and fake hoes
I feel like time flies when your life's on a tightrope
I see my problems and think I got the antidote
And yes I'm still faded
I wish I could make it but I ruined my relations
People think I'm playing when I tell 'em I'm the greatest
So much on my mind, it's hard for me to even say it

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I, wear my heart on my sleeve
Four grams in my leaf, blessed up like I sneezed
They don't know what I know and I know I believe
So I'ma go'n recieve, everything that I need, but my

[Chorus]
Paranoia (paranoia), yeah yeah
I can't never be there for ya, yeah yeah
But I'ma pull up on ya, yeah yeah
Just to show you that I love ya
I walk outside, throw my hands to the sky (to the sky)
Let my heart spill, I know you can hear my cries (hear my cries)
Demons in my eyes, seen them hiding in disguise (in disguise)
Yeah, paranoia for my life, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm counting all my blessings
Praying every second as I fall in deep depression
And lately I been gone, feeling like I'm second guessing
Everything I worked for, is that even in the question
And I know they act like they care but they all show fake love
I need to get high so point me to the plug
I need a strong buzz so give me the right drug
I feel like nobody and that I'm good enough, huff
I had to make some changes
Wake up every morning mad because I haven't made it
See my family stressin' out, I'm working hard to change it
Go and get the stainless, take a shot until I'm painless

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I, wear my heart on my sleeve
Four grams in my leaf, blessed up like I sneezed
They don't know what I know and I know I believe
So I'ma go'n recieve, everything that I need, but my

[Chorus]
Paranoia (paranoia), yeah yeah
I can't never be there for ya, yeah yeah
But I'ma pull up on ya, yeah yeah
Just to show you that I love ya
I walk outside, throw my hands to the sky (to the sky)
Let my heart spill, I know you can hear my cries (hear my cries)
Demons in my eyes, seen them hiding in disguise (in disguise)
Yeah, paranoia for my life, yeah yeah
