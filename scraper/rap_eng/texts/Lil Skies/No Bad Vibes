[Intro]
Yuh, woah, hey, hey, hey, hey, yuh
Yuh, yuh

[Verse 1]
Aye, look at life like it's so amazing
Half famous but I knew the fame wouldn't change us
Lil Skies what they call me yeah that's what my name is
And niggas still want beef but where the fuck an angus
I'm peepin' all the fake shit, I got my eyes open
They see I play for keeps like I got the wooden token
My life fast, I'm outgoing, guess that's why I'm open
I'm single for a reason, fuck havin' my heart broken
I turned nothin' to somethin' it's crazy how it goes
From same clothes, to now I'm fuckin' the baddest hoes
From bein' lazy, to now I'm focusin' on my goals
From bad grades, to finally makin' honor roll
I made my mom proud it feels good
My chest hurts, guess I smoked too many backwoods
I'm tryna blow up do an interview with West wood
Until then I'm workin' hard because I know I should (nigga)

[Hook]
(Yuh, yuh) It's okay, and it's alright (yuh, yuh)
I made my way and still I fight (yuh, yuh)
All the pain and all the lies (yuh, yuh)
I spread my wings and still I fly (yuh, yuh)
Tell my momma, yuh, tell her, yuh, no bad vibes (no bad vibes, yuh, no bad vibes)

[Verse 2]
Look, fuck your feature I don't need your clout
'Cause to be honest I'm the greatest thing comin' out
I work hard when I say it I don't have no doubts
I took chances when they told me we was in a drought
My little brother looks up to me, gotta be cautious
I brought the wave to you niggas, made you all nauseous
My dad got himself a girl, glad he doin' well
Remember six years ago when he went through hell
As times change and my little sister is growin' up
It hurts my heart knowin' that I'm not around as much
Remember when she was little, was playin' barbies with her
Perfect Kodak moment, I wish I could paint the picture
But life's short so I'm livin' mines day by day
I'm askin' God to look over me so that's why I pray
And people look at my tweets like is that really you
Actions speak louder than words and here's my fuckin' proof

[Hook]
(Yuh, yuh) It's okay, and it's alright (yuh, yuh)
I spread my wings and still I fly (yuh, yuh)
All the pain and all the lies (yuh, yuh)
(oh shit I fucked it up) No bad vibes
No bad vibes, all summer '16, no bad vibes
