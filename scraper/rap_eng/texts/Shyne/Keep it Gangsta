[Verse 1: G. Dep]
I got enough flows to spit, the coldest shit
Give you what you supposed to get, to close ya lip
I got enough O's to get, and hoes to hit
Try to stick ya nose in shit, get froze and stiff
Talkin' 'bout load ya clip, and O's you flip
When you ain't holdin shit but droze and dick
Roll the spliff, take the toke
You either gettin cake or broke, you can stay awake or croak
Take a note, take a vote
By a landslide, tell ya man slide or I'll shake ya boat
Take ya toast, this rap shit I make the oath
To get cake or estates by the lake or boat
Bad hoes, insatiable
See the snake, eat steak, leave faith they hate to go
Yo, its to late to blow
Ya run around pay for hoes, that's why ya paper low

[Hook: Shyne]
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Flood ya block, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Coke them rocks, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Drop the top, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Wylin, stylin, keep it gangsta

[Verse 2: Shyne]
Shyne Po, I keep it gully like im supposed too
In a hard top something frontin
I must of fired, died, came back as a rapper
Scarface, smith and eights, in my life after
Bone crushers on my hip, cause shit get thick
In the mist of killas tryin to get rich
I'm two shells from hell tell 'em I'm made for this life
District attorney, tryin' to indict
But I don't give a fuck, cause I'mma do me
Till them hollow points, rip through me
I was born to die, live for what?
Plush slut, bucks, guns and dust
Spent late nights in the kitchen, wishin'
Watchin the pot boil, mixin, sniffin
Keepin America high, and why wouldn't I?
Gangstas don't talk, we beat the case and walk

[Hook: Shyne]
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Flood ya block, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Coke them rocks, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Drop the top, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Wylin, stylin, keep it gangsta

[Verse 3: G. Dep]
Yo, I got wild fed to earn, lead to burn
Slot time, dead ya turn
Lotta cats gotta wait til they dead to learn
Pastor Rev. Sermen, ya learnin'
I'mma wild card to play, guard ya pay
Goodbye's hard to say, cause ya moms to pray
Ya lookin odd and gay, I'm modern day
I'mma rep till im hard and gray, pardon me
I'mma make it hard today, bombs away
Launch grenades, at your entourage and blaze
Calm ya rage, I ain't even on ya page
Ya see-thru like lingerie, guns in a large array
Hit the door, kick the raw, spit that law, then spits some more
Everybody hit the floor, I'm quick to draw
Flows like hittin bitches raw, to sick to cure

[Hook: Shyne]
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Flood ya block, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Coke them rocks, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Drop the top, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Wylin, stylin, keep it gangsta
