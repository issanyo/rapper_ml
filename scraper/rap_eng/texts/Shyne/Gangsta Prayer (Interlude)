The lord is my shepherd
Let's get this coke measured
And as I walk through the valley of the shadow of gangstas
I fears nothin but God and bein broke
I stack paper and flow to fast cars in the presence of my enemies
Niggas waitin for me to break
Shit, ain't nothin foldin but my money
We them niggas wit big guns and big dicks
We afraid of bein broke, so we shed bricks
This thing of ours, will never be devoured
Bad Boys,we move in silence
In the name of power, money, and glory forever and ever
Amen
