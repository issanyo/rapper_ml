They say that I'm a euphemism for a new religion
Praying that my comrades all get out of prison
Stuck in Clinton, in a system where they’re thinking that I did it
Deserve to be born in the first place, ‘cause of my pigment
Darker than the Caucasoid complexion kind of different
On a Harley David is King David saying my tehilim
Pistol in my waist still wrapped in my tefillin
On a camel with the Arabs cause Ishmael is my sibling
I’m on my own thing, yes, Moses
I don’t part the sea, I fly a jet across the ocean
Yeah, God the one that wrote this
So make sure that you’re listenin' ‘cause I’m just an instrument
I’m from the block where ain't no scholarships
Guess she only knew the things I do make my momma sick
And Larry Hoover was my tutor
Now I made teshuva from the King Crown of Judah

Beware that you’re not listening to the king of Judah rhythm
Running over pigeons in my Lamborghini engine
Try to make a billion, middle finger to you critics
I'mma always be the illest, whether mobster or Hasidic
Don’t care about no image, bro, I’m runnin' buildin' bridges
For the people desert equal cats, who they were on the pavement. (?)
Trayvon Martin, Martin Luthor King they wanna kill us
Star of David in my visions, ya'll be knowing who the king is
Yes Moses, I’m on a boat, get shot skin ya
Hundred million on the ocean
Yeah, black diamond, red roses
Whoo for Africa, oh, hail the Ethiopians
I’m all about philanthropy
Money for the Po', big talk, can you answer me?
