Walking out of sing sing
500 horses, porches on the engine
Bussing multibillion thoughts and killer instincts
We win, we win
Money pile to the ceiling, ceiling
Bury enemies in the ce-ment, ce-ment
Money, money, money yeah in that sequence
Man I been unruly
Coming on your block with big bad toolies
We don't want to talk when we swing that Uzi
Fuck the DA, the judge and the Jury
We up, we up
These rappers soft like a B cup, C cup
World cup you could never, ever be us
Badman song, wheel it, wheel it
