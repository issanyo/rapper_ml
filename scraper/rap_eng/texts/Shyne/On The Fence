[Verse 1 - Shyne]
Yeah
I know we slip and I know we fall
And I came a long way watched Kobe ball
On TNT late night
Made it to a place where I don't hate life
In my room playing Ja Rule tunes rule 316
Couple years later about to be 16
With a fresh whip, and a fresh bitch
Weren't a sneakerhead but I had fresh kicks
Done sprouted up since I was a freshman
Still writing rhymes but afraid to express them
No confidence that I will impress them
Perfection, a quest I'm obsessed with
Till my nigga Bless came through with a blessing
Told me always have answers, never have questions
Like the '01 Sixers squad
Don't be scared to take the shot
Man keep the pistol armed
In this game, no one gets along
Just don't get pissed off
I don't want you pissing on
I write the script alone
You rip the song
No producer I just mix at home
And it still sound better
Now they mouth got the zipper on
I spill blood when I crip walk on
These instrumentals
Keep your dental plan tight
Heavy punch lines [?] like a [?] fight
And your boy cold like a winter time night
And the flow like a river out in Amazon life
And I did it all for you
Best believe I did it all for you
And that's all the truth
And part of me that this love was so hard to lose
Got a new chick
But a part of me
Still wants a little part of you
I'm tryna keep this shit from falling through

[Hook - Bless Da Gawd]
Don't hurt me no more
Is what she screaming to me crying
As I'm walking out the door
It may seem like my heart is there no more
But my heart is blare for sure
For things that weren't so pure [x2]

[Verse 2 - Bless Da Gawd]
Tired of crying
And so tired of lying
Next to a nigga
That she don't trust
And she know he lying
Except when he say "I love you"
That I really want us to
But I really want us two
To fix this problem that's in front of you
These days I can't stomach food
So sick [?]
Oh shit
You done moved on to something with your girls
Moulin Rouge
Don't get nobody hurt girl
Don't get nobody murked girl
Take the too far pain from these scars
We'll leave him on this shirt girl
But I chill for you
Fuck that I kill for you
No mask, No glove, That's proof
That I reveal to you
This a bitter nigga with a sick flow
Push you away so it zip close
Ran down on a nigga cause he exposed
Get the shirt off my chest so I quick fold
Uh oh

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Bless Da Gawd]
It's a cold world
For old girl
Rhinestones and broken hearts
No diamonds or pearls
She fell in love fast
Forward now she got a little girl
That look too much like her daddy
So the mama mind is in a whirl
Baby mama drama
Got more beef than Benihanas
Ironically, she brought me out my shell like Ms. Obama
Please your honor don't judge me
But if you do it won't budge me
Sip a cup of this muddy
And now my vision is fuzzy
Yesterday you yelled fuck me
Now you whispering fuck me
You get me so confused with this bad luck girl I get so lucky
Now some lines you're not supposed to get
The others you can keep
At the altar altered tailored suit
I'm sowing what I reap
Now some lines you're not supposed to get
The others you can keep
At the altar altered tailored suit
I'm sowing what I reap
Let him preach
Yeah yeah
Let him be
Damn that felt good
