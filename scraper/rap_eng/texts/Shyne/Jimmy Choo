[Intro - Shyne]
Yeah
Shyne, gang land, murder inc
Haha
Alright, turn the beat up
I see you, ok!

[Verse 1 - Shyne]
Alright, turn the beat up
I see you
Ok

I see you ma, in your thoughsand doller weave
Master P's diamond face on your sleeve
Def Island, waist petite
Alright, Jimmy Choo shoes on your feet?
Shoot, right!
Slide inside the spider
I know you tired of guys who try to lie
To slide inside you
Forget about that, lets go
Forget about rap, I'm Po!
I mean really, I been gettin money
Since niggas is rappin for me
Its fast as shit
Coz you dont look like, you got your head right
I just hope you can give head right
Breezin through Eggshell headlights
New York is mine, relax your mind

[Hook - Ashanti]
Oooooooooooooooo
Can't nobody
Do them things we do
And can't nobody
Touch me like u do
Can't nobody
Love me like you do
And can't nobody
Be like me and you

[Verse 2 - Shyne]
This is Me!
I'm mostly respected
Ring down to the necklace
Some hoes say I'm sexist
Coz all I wanna do is stuff coke in they breastes
Sit back, lift stakes, count money
In the zone, roll that dope
Like this, come on
I need a prada chick
To take this dick, and take this script
And flick this shit, base this shit
We can go shopping and buy some things
Up in Harry Winston ma, try some rings
How you feel like you is Princess Di
So much cuts on your wrist
They could draw suicide
No lie, you ain't heard?
Extensive trips, expensive whips
You ain't seen nothing like this
Not in your life
If I ain't that nigga, shit you fuckin right

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Shyne]
Who gon' cop them hoes? (Po)
Who gon rock them clothes? (Po)
Who gon' pop them fros? (Po)
Well I'm glad you know
No need to ask who holla'd
You ain't nada, me alotta
Shyne Winton gotta
See you niggas in hell
Now lets prevail, feds on the tell
Just post bail, a million in cash
Now you know that ain't rappin pimpin
Please believe that
Body smoked like we was just ganna clap em' up
That ain't enough? then why you backing up
Niggas talking real greesy on them rap records
Look I'm strip you naked, take your necklace
Give it to my soldiers like "hold this"
Fuck you nigga you could never fool this
But anyway back to business
Lets play
One CPW come through
I like girls that like girls
That like girls that like furrs
Ok
