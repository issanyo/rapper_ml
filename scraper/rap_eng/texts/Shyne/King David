You never met a roller like me, its unlikely half of them boys is trying to idite me
You entice me, I let them have them 9 years never mind the fact you was rolling with the right breed
They pale in comparison, now turn you on to something we could burn down Madison
I have you looking like Marilyn Monroe in this bitch yea its Po in this bitch
Get your Louie 13 and ro'se too sip, presidenal suite Barack O in this bitch
Listen ma, the motion is this, just long hard dick ain't no roses and shit
Ain't another like me, its unlikely half of them boys is trying to idite me
You entice me, I let them have them 9 years nevermind the fact you was rolling with the right breed
I'm on the move, what you wanna do
5 inch mules yeah I take it to the moon
To the dark side, you rolling with the shyne
Half them bad boys but they never get a try
Never will I buy the notion i should die,If im formed to the system that will sentence me to die
Take it as a sign, preferences that I die, young counting ones, I'ma live a life of crime
I'm away to the Tolomac, in that all black, Monsoon jet fuel yea we charter that
G5 New York caught a heart attack
Since I've been gone, she was dead but I brought her back
Where them carters sat
â€¦ where I murder that, same cell that I live, what you call a rap
You see that blogger crap I don't want no part of that
I speak for the kids and you're wondering where their father's at. Roger that I'm on a corner track, ain't no turning back from this money that i made from rap
And a couple weeks, couple millions I squander that partners in the prison screaming fuck obama at
I'm falling back, why you ponder that
I'm sunset boulvard looking for a rat, for a cat
Sit here on my lap and tell about the max ma
They will have to kill me, I ain't never going back
King of the jungle one eye on the vultures other eye on the legs
Ma you can call me Moses
I don't park the rigs see I fly across the ocean, in a g50 fit out, they like Anita Joseph
Kennedy run the world from the Caribbeans, 300 foot boats, this shit is simply riveting
Monte Cristo, take a puff of this living in my own fucking world
Where only the villain wins
10 years, striped of all my rights but tonight, I just wanna stripper for that tight
Get your modeling legs in the air, screaming east side, watch me hold it right there
10 years but I never lost sight, now we're living for today so let's fuck all night
I embodied that buggati dope gang boy life, you can say it's wrong but ain't nothing alright
Ain't another like me, its unlikely half of them boys is trying to idite me
You entice me, I let them have them 9 years nevermind the fact you was rolling with the right breed
