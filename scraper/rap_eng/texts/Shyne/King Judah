They say that I’m an euphemism for a new religion
Praying that my comrades all get out of prison
Stuck and clicking in a system where they’re thinking that I did it
I deserve to be born in the first place, ‘cause I’m a pigment
Talking in the car is all blessed and kind of different
On a holiday, ‘cause they can’t say how much I heal ‘em
Preston in my way, still bet on my fulfilling
On a camera with the arrows, ‘cause Ihmail is my sibling
I’m on my own thing, yes, Moses
I don’t part the sea, I fly a jet across the ocean
Yeah, caught it when they want us
So make sure that you’re missing me, ‘cause I’m just the instrument
I’m from the blackway, no scholarships
Guess she only knew the things I do make my momma sick
And the rehuva was my tutor
Now I meant to shoot her from the king crown to Judah
Beware that you’re not listening to the king of Judah rhythm
Running over pigeons in my Lamborghini engine
Try to make a billion and I think that you did credits
Imma always be the illest, with the maps to the ceiling
Don’t care about no image, bro, I’m in to down the bridges
For the people desert equal cats, who they were on the pavement
Drave on, I’m a new king, they wanna kill a star
David in my visions, I’ll be knowing who the king is
It’s Moses, I’m on a boat, care shots, skin ya’
On a million on the ocean
Yeah, black diamond, bad poses
Whoo for Africa, oh, hail the Ethiopians
I’m all about philanthropy
Money for the pope, big talking, you against me?
Smoking on a cuba, lying in a cougar, king crowned Judah
