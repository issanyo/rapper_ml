I guess you must to say, they won’t listen to me
Said is to die in this chair where they gonna cook me
Where did I go on this road to start it
They got me payin for what didn’t got it
Hard my heart it’s no longer thrubin
I’m racin to a place where I embrace my cuffin
I’m in, man whatever you callin
To guards in the cherry it’s screw to penny list
For now my try to turn in the streets
They say rehabilitation don’t apply to me
Is it I’m black is it my color I’m in prison
’cause my picnic got me sitting to destruction
Since my day is an infant

Hook:
Hell Lord, dear Lord we did the let me get a pardon
So hard in the streets but we ain’t fallin
Screw to y’all I’ma eat blood we ain’t stoppin
Left the bottles in the sheets blood we ain’t talking
Hell Lord, dear Lord we did the let me get a pardon
Ain’t got a jump shot me and Jordan
He ain’t go to..blood we ain’t harve it
I talk for the streets solo ones and..
Brrr brr smoke ball cry, blood the rhythm of the streets since the sin of the east
They say I’m wrong ’cause I’m on
But nobody say nothing bout duffing the on
They never say nothing bout ..
Free seat murder and the wallins
Little busters thinking they gonna come up
Bout catching the chargement
And when the jer won’t make you a star
And when the jail gonna make you like ..
Tear it to the ..glass behind the beat ball
Ain’t no business, ain’t no women blood ain’t no three wishes
Is a big standing over probably told you why you whistle
Listen I give it all just to be on the town with my moms
This this hell for me, this is hell for me
Mama pray for me

Hook:
Hell Lord, dear Lord we did the let me get a pardon
So hard in the streets but we ain’t fallin
Screw to y’all I’ma eat blood we ain’t stoppin
Left the bottles in the sheets blood we ain’t talking
Hell Lord, dear Lord we did the let me get a pardon
Ain’t got a jump shot me and Jordan
He ain’t go to..blood we ain’t harve it
I talk for the streets solo ones and..
Caution, baby the..kings as they lobs and now trade marchin
For those that don’t know this is die mood talking
Lot of bad but to fight for the black is McCalin
Like..started before you was mallin
I’ma be guarded against the garden list
Bang on them bigs that’s a pressing as
They afraid ’cause the way is in my DNA
Look into my eyes you can see God face
Ain’t no case that could change but it’s in my DNA man
Screw to bad boys in the..police
God bless IG no G supreme
If now for curtains Jackson now it all be free
But the crip made the deal with the feds and square
Michael and Gabriel help me
What they gonna tell me, he?
