This little buster name the Game wanna rhyme like Po
Cuz I rhyme like gold
I rhyme like, I be climbin' out that rolls
The nine I let it blow
Put 5 up in ya clothes
Head shots leave you slumped, dumped and reclinin' at ya door
Oh'
This is blasphemy
Ya whole entire career patterned after me
I got shooters out in Cali that will blast for me
Your forgot, I put your chest where your back should be
Tech squeeze off rapidly
I'm in Paris at the Plaza, blood, ask for me
You little ungrateful bastard forgot to say your grace after me
Now bow down pay homage and ask to breathe
Yea'
Shyne Michael or Moses
Homicidal motives
You thinkin' this is showbiz
I will put you with the blowfish
Hand on my toasters
Lamborghini roasters
I gave these rappers life but I will turn them into ghosts
Maloy apostle gospel new god flow
I blew breath into your nostrils
Only god knows I'm the idol that you bow to
Realest alive, your red flag is a costume
This mobsters jewish
The talk is useless
You wanna box? I put you in a box with embalming fluid
I bomb with Rugers
Dump you in the pond with sewage
I put that on Big Wolf: I ain't suin'
Hold up
Get what you came for
You the big bad blood, what you scared for?
Shoot the butterfly off your face
Tell Jesus Peace and I will smile at your wake
