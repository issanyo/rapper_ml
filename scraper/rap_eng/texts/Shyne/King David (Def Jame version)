5 inch mules yeah I take it to the moon
To the dark side, you rolling with the Shyne
Alphabet boys, but they never get a trial
Never will I buy, the notion i should ride, or conform to a system that will sentence me to die
Take it as a sign, preferences that I die, young counting ones, I'ma live a life of crime

Father's at
Roger that I'm on a corner trap, ain't no turning back from this money that i made from rap
And in a couple weeks, couple mill I squander that
Partners in the prison screaming fuck obama at

On sunset Boulevard looking for a cat, for a cat
Sit here on my lap and tell about the max ma
They will have to kill me, I ain't never going back

King of the jungle one eye on the vultures other eye on the legs
Ma you can call me Moses
I don't part the red sea I fly across the ocean, in a G50 fit out, they like Anita Joseph
Kennedy run the world from the Caribbean, 300 foot boats, this shit is simply riveting
Monte Cristo, take a puff of this living in my own fucking world
Where only the villain wins

10 years, striped of all my rights but tonight, I just wanna strip off all that tight
Get your modelling legs in the air, screaming east side, watch me hold it right there

10 years but I never lost sight, now we're living for today so let's fuck all night
