Chorus:
Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rustler
I used to be a mobster burning at the block
Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rustler
I used to be a mobster burning at the block
Don't judge a book by the cover
Everything will be in this world is your brother
When I lost the fun... uncover
Ancient words that... me to love ya!
So we're born to return to the mother
And we earn to told what I told ya about yourself
Who you are,what you should be
I'm gone to be ... leave it up to me!
Shouts through the sky, look out to the night
Feel alright!
Stars burn bright, I like the moonlight
You'll be alright!

Chorus:
Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rustler
I used to be a mobster burning at the block
Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rustler
I used to be a mobster burning at the block
Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rustler
I used to be a mobster burning at the block
This is the medicine, I'm not like the...
With this life I'm... and this life I'm treasuring
This is the medicine, I'm not like the...
Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a monster
Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a monster
Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a monster
I went runing away to the cave
..came out all flames
I went running away for the hills
Back to my roots and I'm running still
But now I'm running to face my dreams
Found my place and what it means
Find yourself and no one else
You have to leave it up to me, leave it up to me!

Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rustler
I used to be a mobster burning at the block
Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rustler
I used to be a mobster burning at the block
This is the medicine, I'm not like the...
With this life I'm... and this life I'm treasuring
Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rustler
Buffalo soldier, you know I'm not a rustler
I used to be a mobster burning in the block
...the DA and the depute
Sorry... and I know you didn't lecture me
Maybe I stopped talking about guns
When you talk about the... that they cut for the youth
Let's caught to the truth, ain't enough for the youth
So tell me how you... stuck in the shoes, yeah!
Where the Congressmen, where all the Senate men?
We're thinking about that green, not the color of the President?
This is just a relevance..
...you know that I'm a measure it!
They say that we are in a post Obama era
Well exactly what that mean? you needn't make it clear
Doesn't mean that the...
..make things...
..but now I'm such a hypocrite and..
In the... nobody never loved us
I am just the result of pain and hunger!

Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rustler
I used to be a mobster burning at the block
Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rustler
I used to be a mobster burning at the block
