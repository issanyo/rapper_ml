[Hook]
Close your eyes and turn off the lights
Listen to the words that this author writes
Seen so much, so many poor to life
Darker life, wrong's only God can right
Think back when I was loose, rolling around
Extra?, bout to gun something down
Ain't care about a rap career cat
You violate I go twist ya bedcap
I'm kinda blessed that night in that club
Nobody died from that slug
I think about the way that I was
I tell ya I was on one, cuz
Bout to catch a few bodies, woulda probably caught the chair
First album ya'll woulda never got to hear
I can't believe that I'm here, I should've been buried with my pad

[Hook]
Close your eyes and turn off the lights
Suffering all my life
Listen to the words that this author writes
Close your eyes and turn off the lights
And listen to the words that this author writes

[Verse 2]
I guess everything happens for a rhyme and reason
Still don't excuse the lying and treason
You could face 100 years in the precinct
Keep your mouth closed, ain't no speaking
When you in the streets, this is how it goes
Police ask you say 'you don't know'
Make sure the witness all follow same code
Death before dishonor 'til they take away your soul
I need to know, how my co-d called witness to sacrifice me
Just so he can get away free, this does not comply with the streets
But he ain't from there, this is not a smear
This is what they fear, the whole truth, I swear

[Hook]
Close your eyes and turn off the lights
Listen to the words that this author writes
Close your eyes and turn off the lights
Man, only wrongs God can right

[Verse 3]
Look, one thing about me, I was never naive
I might've played dumb to get what I need
But I could see, who was he, nothing ain't surprise me about this creep
Ha, I from the land of the east, all up in the streets
Man mi nuh skin teeth, eyes wide shut shotta don't sleep
Look, I seen the plot. What he did to Mase, and he did to LOX
What he did to Wolf and he did to?
God bless the dead, Notorious PAC
Why would I think that I was different, so I just sat in the distance
Kept my mouth closed, looked and listened
Learned all the trades of the sharks and fishes
Turn off the lights
Suffering all my life
Wrongs only God can right

[Verse 4]
I got partners go to jail for bodying?
Get shot, know who shot him? I won't testify in court
This kid got millions, that's how he talks
Should've took that paper, made his soul walk
Talking about he ain't responsible for my actions
Man, if I was yapping the world, woulda knew what happened
Them kids was about to wrap him
Shyne, they should thank him. But nooooo, they hate him
I hope I ain't rambling, ya'll got questions I'm just answering

[Hook]
Close your eyes and turn off the lights
Listen to the words that this author writes
Suffering all my life
Man, wrongs only God can right

[Verse 5]
Alpo did it to Rich, Brutus did it to Caesar
Throughout history, the thing is repeated
In a world where Sammy the Bull is leaders
Frank Lucas' and Joseph Massino's
Nooooo, that ain't my world
All I got is my... and my word
Until the electric chair burns, I don't bend I don't turn
You ain't to blame for the witness you called
To say it was me, naaah that ain't your fault
The lawyers you paid, I mean that you bought
To sacrifice me in open court, ha
I moved on, I promise no more songs
Blood, I wish you well, haha, now watch me sell
