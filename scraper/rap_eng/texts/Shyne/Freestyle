I-Live-and-die for this shit, get my bitch ? this shit
Black cartel I be selling coke in hell
Go to war with satan over blocks like 'you can't be serious?'
I need them spots!
Keep niggas brains on drugs, so I can keep that chain on stud
Never had much to live for, till papi showed me how to take that pure and turn 1 to 4
Now im in the 6, cause the Bentley to hot
Hard top niggas kill you quicker in the drop
It's hell up in Babylon, y'all stupid niggas is sprintin'
While this shit is a marathon
See me in 10 years and 10 cars late, a 1000 bricks stronger, all the money I can launder
A bad bitch sniffin' coke of my tip
Quintin Tarantino couldn't write this shit!

I just wanna mobve mad bricks, for all the days I never had shit
Now I'm young heartless and rich, pistols and pussy straight from the door, brown paper bags full of blood money I need more
Too much ain't enough, high off dust
The greed is never ending, catchin bodies I'm what gotti supposed to be, Is overgrowing
Face smothered in coca√Øne, against all odds
Life is what you make it so I made it, leaving motherfuckers naked
Get exited watching niggas bleed helplessly so I kill 'm  put 'm out their misery selfishly
All gangsters is dead or in jail except for me I posted bail, all hail

Bad Boy 2 triple 0

Greeting niggas with a smile like Ha My name is, Mister leave you brainless with this motherfucking stainless, fuck you bitch in the anus, playboy we gangsters nigga, we ain't no fucking entertainers
Rap 's my alter ego, missles and torpedos is what I'm working with
Tell me how you love that, RAW
Screw the law we above that
Boy you front, get dumped boy
We plug that
These brooklyn niggas on some shit keep loadin' them clips black
Talons and them hollow tips that explose when they hit
The lord is my sheppard let's get this coke measured
Cause all I want is plenty of guns and diamonds to flaunt
Screw a 9 to 5, I've got a 9 and a .45 rip your meat
You will be cold cheeks and closed eyes
All I want to be is a G left the Judge in a pool of blood now I'm free
Bad Boy 2 triple 0, can't be stopped
Not by the feds or the fucking cops
My watch got rocks you can spot from a block
Bitches stop and me get up in they crotch
Another day another shootout- homicide
Kicking in the door shit, desert 4 shit
Putting everybody on the floor shit, sneaking UZI's up in court shit!
Bitches sniffin' coke off each others breasts, real niggas bustin tecs
Sendin' threats with bullets, putting niggas in ambulatz
Fuck a dollar and a dream, I've got a 17 shot magazine that 'll materilize everything to cream, gangsta lean and continental laws
Fucking R&B stars, Yeah I like that, black Donald Trump, I hold more weight then the clumps Nigga
