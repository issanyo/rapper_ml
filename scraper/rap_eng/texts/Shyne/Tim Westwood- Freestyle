P diddy verse:

Not going to add this

Shyne:

The hottest nigga to do it since Nicholas Barnes, poppin' and choppin' until the day that I'm gone
Shyne Po, a players dream coming true on vinyl
Prominant premiere premium prime flow?!( like whatsup)
Washing and spending nothing but blood thug crime
Shots in the spinal for my rivals, just cross the T's and dot the I's and
Pay the Judge, drop the top and let's ride
Shit, It's the kid rapper fearin' if cowards don't know I rather be racketeering somewhere bustin' shots in the atmosphere and not caring fucking the prosecuter at my hearing
Money launderin', honeys wonderin'
Who me? I reply casually, I'm what god would be if he was a straight G tonight too tight, arrogant bitch you right!

Diddy again…

Shyne second verse:

Shyne 's hotif you commentary you can find my LP in the commisary
A Dudes LB/will be? in the yard like well he sounds like but I don't give a fuck that dude Shyne's nice
No disrespect to you Poppa great one
We all know ain't never gonna be a great one like you
So screw haters, drink gasoline, rape a non and go to hell
For all I care..
Cettulini?! when you c me, is all I wear, God and being broke is all I fear so screw it
Had a Mill I blew it, so foul, snort coke, mink short coats, postal bitch
You like the profile, so bow, brooklyn nigga never blow trial, jewels with no clouds, make hoes go Auhw, sniffin and grippin, whippin, my guns go pow, Ooh now
By the time you hear that you be on the flo' niggas like
Nah dawg, don't get near that, swear that
When I hit you, rip through tissue, split you, lift you, miss you
Nah, but your moms will
Is the S slash princess cut pross Po
Them 2 cars you leased
Please, I bought 4
And also, in case y'all forgot
BAD boy ain't never gonna stop

I pop pussy, I pop 9's and I pop pain
I'm not sane, cop aim leave your nuts stained
In the dot range, chop caine
No shoes player, leave the drop plain
Got game last name should be obtain
Open my mouth spit nothing but hot flames
I'm what you not, that's on too hot
No way you 'round it surround by riches and bitches
Flaming when I spit the slugs
A dude like me turns crips to blood (fire)
You go from he is to he was, in memory of
Etcetera, gun cocks like Deborah
Push up on broads, like bra's
The motive to get up in they draws and jaws
Shyne, by any means necessary, kidnap your moms and your pops it was necessary..


Verse 3:

I spit guns run up in the spot like wich one, this one? Cock the Sig back then I spit 1,2,3 now he's like Yo I'm hit son, I'm like you still talking and squeeze till the clip done
There 's a few thing I like to adress, Like how fucking with me you can lose your life in your vest
Brain splattered, that's my motto, skiptalk
My gun jam, get your throat slit off
Better Kriss Cross and Jump Jump when the guage pump
Or find yourself, slump, dumped in the Benz trunk
Leave your block cut up
Sleeping on me ?????????
Sweep the Streets when my wolfs pop up
Ask 'm who want it
Niggas debating, death waiting like not us, not us
Niggas never respect your muscle till you demonstrate venom hate
Deliver 'm straight to heavens gate
This goes out to whoever and my snotty nose Combs
Beefing with me is like AIDS, something you don't want
Niggas get it, they dreaded, leave your vest shredded
Yeah I said it, fuck you John Wayne niggas bustin' pallets
Shyne 's that fine cat, 10 times that, 9 clap, nigga spine crack
I'm that, same motherfucker from Hollywood to Harlem
Touch my C's on my G's, Imma harm 'm
On that Shyne you may have to kill type shit
Let you grimey, slimey dog, niggas  bite clips
I'm a product of high pressure and horrific abuse
Didn't get knowledge in school so I learned to shoot

The bridge like outro…
