Ain’t no cure for this name that you put on me
You’re the only thing that look good on me
On my way to the hopper to make a motion picture
Three hundred foot boat, ocean from villa
Let’s be fruitful and multiply
I’m looking at our future with a vulture’s eye
Can’t describe how it feels when I’m sitting here
You’re the one, we’re the pair
Pushing in your lips, ‘cause my drug is your kiss
I’m pushing in your body, give you the feel that you need
Pushing in back door, on the elevator to the top floor
I’m pushing in, need to rush, the way that I’m in your body, the way your body touch
I need them not ten wife, and you were downtown, off the block, ought you off the tax
Long skirts and Channel all the tabs, got them been in a zone in the parking lot
Black diamond earrings, bootine wearing, Felanciago bags have my name in
Incline them a mourning to them lonely nights
Close my eyes, hear your voice through the stereo, like
I’m nothing, but maybe I am, I applaud your existence, I’ve been knowing this thing
Pink lipstick, etcetera, holy matrimony, forever us
Pushing in your lips, ‘cause my drug is your kiss
I’m pushing in your body, give you the feel that you need
Pushing in back door, on the elevator to the top floor
I’m pushing in, need to rush, the way that I’m in your body, the way your body touch
You’re the superstar queen
Can’t nobody mess with our thing
Sitting in myself block I saw things
The young boys ain’t what the boys is
You was made for the whole gun
Your skin complexion and your eye color
Your Louis flats and your flat stomach
I might wanna make you my baby mother
‘cause, baby love, imma seen them all
R&B, actresses, pop, superstars
But none made me wanna give a ring
What’s a man’s world without a queen?
