Dear america, im only what you made me...
Young, black, and fuckin crazy
Please save me

Im dyin inside
Can't you see it in my eyes?
Im hopeless, fearless on the outside
Gun on my side, shit

Maybe if y'all niggas build schools instead of prison
Id stop livin the way in livin
Probably not
Im so used to servin rocks and burnin blocks
I ain't never goin stop
Been doin this shit all my life
Im a lost cause
But what bout the rest?
Don't them suckas deserve a chance?
Somethin better then shoot outs,liquor stores, and food stamps
Maybe if y'all teach them niggas a craft and a trade they wouldn't have to play that corner
You know wha i mean, servin that yay

America, you got a fuckin problem and i ain't never goin away
There's bout 20 million other motha fuckas just like me
Reperations is due
And y'all goin pay
