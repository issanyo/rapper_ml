I spit and reload things
Since livin was gold rings
Fuck a piece of the pie nigga
Gimme the whole thing
I done seen death, seen less, seen more
Feed morphine to more fiends than you've ever seen
It's pain I deliver reflection
Every word like a mirror
Bigger picture I try to keep shit in perspective
Dumbs out, guns out til my time runs out
Capitalistic driving force got no remorse
But I feel shit catching up
Time wrappin' up
Shyne had enough, still I can't have enough
Something bout the engine roarin'
Soarin', wind in my face
Top down, take me to another place

[Hook]
Diamonds and Mac-10's
Tell a friend
Yellow bottles, models, hollows
Til my very end
Catchin up to God quicker
High off this liquor
Niggas come to get yours betta
Know theyre comin with ya

[Repeat]

The day I stuck my head out my mother's womb
I was doomed
Repeatin' the lords prayers sittin' in this court room
I'm cursed
We havin dreams of leavin here up in a hearse
I wonder when I close my eyes will it hurt?
I'm suicidal
Can't take this pressure or this pain
Too much for these young eyes
Real G's don't die, that's a lie
Cuz I'm dyin inside, cryin' inside
Look at me sweatin', palms shakin, hidin' inside
Drive bys and quarter ki's
This ain't what it oughta be
Almost caught a ki
Theyre tellin me that theres more to see
God listen, it was him or me
Sorry for the choices I chose
The bricks that I sold
The voices I rolled
The concrete roads
Accept me as I come into your presence

[Hook x2]

What's it all about?
Sittin in this jail house
Eleven counts, but only one count
Thats the color of my skin
Black robes, white justice
Clarence Thomas is a motherfuckin puppet
Murder anyone over 21
Through my travels I've seen barrels and gavels
Diamonds and Castles
Caught up in this solution called life
When you bitch niggas is shootin', aim right
Say goodnight to the bad guy
Last time you're gonna see a bad guy like me
I'm the last of the dying breed
Hope these words burn your brain
Find a place in your heart
Close my eyes and pray in the dark
Ask God what's the meaning?
Leavin niggas screaming
Bullet holes bleeding, I see demons

[Hook x3]
