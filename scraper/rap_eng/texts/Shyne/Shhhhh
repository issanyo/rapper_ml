[Verse:1]

Must I really state my name, state my claim
What I'm into, things I've been through
More or less, you know about the cases
You know my life is these rapper's career's basis
Behind the wheel with them faces
Foreign broads and them foreign cars
Pray and hope that I'm falling off
Nah my man, I'm holding on
Something new, in that Bugatti blue
Boss, boss, I leave them boys sick
Forty-eight bosses just to prelude to
The evils these cold streets made me do
Ratchets I've blazed, rivals I've buried
Millions I've spent to story-line buries
Y'all be knowing how hard I roll
Ain't got to tell you young bloods, Ya'll all know!


[Hook]

I ain't got to talk about it
Tell New York about it
California know about it
H-Town know about it
Arizona know about it
Chi-Town know about it
Ain't got to flow about it


[Verse:2]
Must I really go on, on a song about my time
And fights on all amounts, bidding with lights
Old timers keeping my head to the script
Let this time serve you, have faith in God kid
Must I really say, I shot a few goons
But for the most part, think the realest is cool
Guess I'd say I searched my soul, but found nothing new
Just what was already there, things that I already knew
And must I talk about my time in the box?
Doing sly feds, twenty-three on the cops
In the next cell, my partner was locked
Going through hell, since the rock
