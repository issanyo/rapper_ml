Yo This is the remix

[Shyne]
I'll pop Pussy
Pop Nine's and I'll pop Pain
I'm not sane
Cop aim leave U not stayin'
In da dark range, Chock pain
No shoes for ya, leave da drop plain
Got game, last name should be octane
Open my mouth spit nuttin but hot flames
I want you now, dats why I'm too hot
No way around this surrounded by riches and bitches
Flamin, when I'll spit wit slugz, A nigga like me turn cripz to bloods
You go from he is to he was
In memory of, ecetera, gun Cox like Deborah
Push up on broads, like bras
My mode is to get up in they jaws and drawers
Shyne, by any means necesarry
Kidnap yo momz and yo popz if it's necesarry

[112]
Here we are, all alone
You and me, privacy
And we can do anything
Your fantasy
I wanna make your dreamz come tr-u-u-u-e
Can you hear?
She's callin me between her legs loud and clear
I wanna talk back to her
Make love to her
I wanna hear you scream my name

[Chorus]
We can make love
In the bedroom floatin on top of my waterbed
I'm kissin you, runnin my fingers through your hair
In the hallway makin our way beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere
I can love you in the shower
Both of our bodies drippin wet
On the patio, we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor as I softly pull your hair
We can do it anywhere
Anywhere

I love the way
Your body feels, right next to mine
So take your time we got all night
Girl you know, I love you so
And I know you love me too
Baby
Please don't stop, I feel it now
You feel it too, you're shivering
Oooh you're puttin me close to you
Just let it flow
There's no other place to go

[Chorus]
We can make love
In the bedroom floatin on top of my waterbed
I'm kissin you, runnin my fingers through your hair
In the hallway makin our way beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere
[Dru-Hill]
We can do it baby
Baby, tell me, tell me
Do you wanna be a freak
Wanna be a Freak wit me
Said, baby, baby, tell me, won't you tell me
Do you wanna be a freak wit me

[Lil' Z]
Z too hot to stop
I'm celebratin while u niggas be checkin me
Tell me the deally while brothaz is tryin to kill me
Cuz they sisters wanna feel me
She bad to the bone when daddy's gone
You call from yo job but she don't pick up da phone
You know it's on
Strip naked, tease me, touch me, don't rush me
See me in da video, honeyz wanna rub me
Popz don't want me around dats why we go through all these ups and downz
He know you sneakin around
But if he found out I was your first
Would he be hurt?
And add locks to all your tees and skirts
Or even worse
Keep you in da room, doors locked
At 12 o'clock, I'm at yo window like, Knock Knock
He cock Glock
But worldwide playaz get around
His defense was clowned and then I touchdown
Know that
I'm a don guess he doesn't notice
While you lack, I'm all smooth
Come on

[Chorus]
We can make love
In the bedroom floatin on top of my waterbed
I'm kissin you, runnin my fingers through your hair
In the hallway makin our way beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere
I can love you in the shower
Both of our bodies drippin wet
On the patio, we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor as I softly pull your hair
We can do it anywhere
Anywhere
