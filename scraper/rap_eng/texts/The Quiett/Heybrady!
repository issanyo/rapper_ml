[Hook: BRADYSTREET]

[Verse 1: BRADYSTREET]
세 번째 눈뜨고 내 정신은 올라가
미래의 내 모습을 보고 난 oh my god
부정하는 새끼들은 절대 몰라봐
뜨고 싶다면 어서 내 배에 올라타
Blowin up like C4, cuz I got the cheat code
지갑을 더 키워, 볼륨을 더 키워
Started from the zero, 기억들을 지워
Blowin up like C4, cuz I got the cheat code
오늘도 내 머릿속엔 돈
Flipping shipping packs all I know
Get the bag and I’m fuckin gone
Fake friends I’d rather be alone

[Verse 2: Jvcki Wai]
(woah) 기억들을 지워, 전부 reset
(woah) 다시 일어나서 일해, replay
(woah) 몰아치는 후폭풍, hurricane
Burning out 또 I gon burn out, 냅둬 지금 위태
Hit me up nah, plz don’t hit me up
Don’t hit me up, 아니 친구 hit me up
놀고 싶지만 일하고 싶어
일하고 싶지만 뭐
