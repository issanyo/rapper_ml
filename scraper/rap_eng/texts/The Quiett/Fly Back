[Verse 1]
What's up, ATL? I'm flyin' back
18 years, I ain't lying, man
Felt like Daniel in the lion's den
My flows on fire like a frying pan
And since I'm high, let's make a movie
I'm in the air, George Clooney
I'm staying fly, no Kamikaze
Please don't drop atom bombs on me
I come in peace, no need for hammers
But can I meet with DJ Green Lantern?
Man, I missed the Old Country Buffet
And the nice Korean girls American made
The ones that come home back from college
I liked their heads filled with better knowledge
My fans all pitched in to get me here
"Make sure you get an autograph from Britney Spears"

[Hook]
Hop on this big old plane
Close your eyes and get high, high, high, high
It's like a video game
When you glide in the sky, sky, sky, sky, sky

[Verse 2]
They say, "Stay away from Crack and AKs
Wake up early before the day breaks"
Yeah, "Work hard, my son, Ji Hooni
And if it don't work out, go back to Uni."
Body is with Seoul, flows across the globe
Two places at once
This feeling everybody gots to know
Yeah, its way better than blunts
Working my way from Kimchi to butter
Stretch my reach from Asia like rubber
Can't look back and see tears from mother
Spread my wings, now watch me hover
Land of oppurtunities it's America
I'm on Cloud 9, yes, I'm very high
Committed to my dream like a married guy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Man I used to live in a dream
But at this moment I'm livin my dream
I'm sayin I used to live in the past
And right now I'm just playing it back
What I mean is this is the sequel
Like the Bible it only got better
My New Testament
Used to be lactose intolerent, but now I got cheddar
My voice to your ear at the speed of sound
I'm airbourne now I ain't need no bounds
My lyrics are deep, heavy like Iron man
But flow thru these waves like Iron Man
And everything I do, science can't
Ya'll gonna hear me like a siren damn
I'm doin my thing
My heart is royal like a suicide king
I need to catch up, but my skin's mustard
To be hot, dog, ya need hoes and cuss words
That's what "they say" said ordinary John
I guess I gotta spit way more than every one
To prove myself after all I'm new here
Brown ain't the only sweet around like root beer
My brother wanna to be a pilot, he wanna touch the sky
I'mma let his dream fly
