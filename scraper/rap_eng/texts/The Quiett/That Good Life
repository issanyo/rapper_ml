[Intro]

WE LIVE THAT GOOD LIFE!

[Verse 1] (A-Game)
Yeah! Let's get it
I got (what?) winnin on my mental, never gonna quit
Killin instrumentals, better leave the evidence
So it's evident, that we'll be better than
Most of our competition, no trippin, I ain't embellishin
No hate, so if you hate me? That's irrelevant
I'm speaking from the heart, you speak with a speech impediment
Bet we'll get attention like the President
After winnin elections, or bombing people like terrorists
The Good Life is round the corner, I'm feeling it
Fresh like listerine, me and my team we livin it
Gibberish, is what you spittin on the microphone
You ain't dope I recommend you leave the mic alone
I'm livin this satisfactory lifestyle
Droppin tracks now my homie's rollin a White Owl
Right now? I'm fully focused with my rap
Leaving the ones who did me bad up in the past, fuck'em all man!

[Hook] (Skrewz Loose)
Yeah you know we liiiiiiiiive thaaaat

[Verse 2] (T.O.T.)
T.O.T.!
I'm a be blunt like a baseball bat
You and your whole crew? That's a pack of rats
And I don't ever beat on bitches but I smack the track
And in fact, I'm bringing it back I used to listen to that old school rap
A Tribe Called Quest that shit was the best
Then I heard that Wu-Tang and that Smith & Wesson
New York is in my blood I feel connected to the legends
Tellin stories is an art, and most just don't sell it
Y'all just don't get it, I want this more than you
Money in other countries they love me because I'm rude
I may be rude, but I got places I can take you
And we can hit up San Remo too
Get anything you want me to get you, money is no object
And you can show me all the innocence you haven't lost yet
Got them new Nike's with the strap and yellow check
Girl, That Good Life I can have you screaming "We The Best!"

[Hook] (Skrewz Loose)
Yeah you know we liiiiiiiiive thaaaat
Good Life, Good Life
And we got some goooooood weeeeeeeeeeed
Get high, get high
And we keep it reeeeeeeaaal
No lie, no lie
Yeah you know we liiiiiiiiive thaaaat
Good Life, Good Life ayyyeee
Yeah you know we liiiiiiiiive thaaaat
Good Life, Good Life, Good Life
And we got some goooooood weeeeeeeeeeed
Get high, get high, get high
And we keep it reeeeeeeaaal
No lie, no lie, no lie
Yeah you know we liiiiiiiiive thaaaat
Good Life, Good Life, Good Life

[Verse 3] (Bird)
Ain't nothin perfect but I live a Good Life
Don't worry about me, worry about yourself aight?
Feelin right I been up all night, writin rhymes sniffin WHAT?!
Trust in yourself put in work till the job is done
Be your own boss, grow up and be in charge
If you talk the talk, walk the walk even if it's far!
When I get a gun, I'm a shoot for the stars
Keep it real homie, I will never be flaw, hell naw
I smoke good and drink good yeah I'm living good
Fuck with my life? Shit, I wish somebody would
I'm in the best mood yeah I love what I do
I smoke dope and rap, I smell weed in the room
I live a Good Life and I hope you do, too!
Here's some good advice don't drop out of school
Bird, T.O.T., A-Game we Skrewz Loose
Fuck a boring life, we got fun shit to do tonight!

[Hook] (Skrewz Loose)
Yeah you know we liiiiiiiiive thaaaat
Good Life, Good Life
And we got some goooooood weeeeeeeeeeed
Get high, get high

[Outro] (T.O.T.)
Yeah, T.O.T
I'm chill with it, cold like a fridgerator
Ain't playin with you haters, I live That Good Life
My house a igloo, I got penguins for my neighbors
I am so so cold, but I live That Good Life aye!
Burr!
