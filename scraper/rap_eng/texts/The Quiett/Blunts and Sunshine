[Intro]


[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Good morning, Cheers

Cool breeze new steeze with them UV's
Feeling blessed but who sneezing the same flu season
Bubba kushing them blue dreaming that good life
Got them nugs that make ya bug your buzz light
My homes home to "what up holmes" and orale's
My K-towners my little brothers and protoge's
In Cali just spit that relax flow yoga flame
A Mac pro while Zo tracks my vocals mang
I knock steady with steady knocks and machete chops
I'm gettin' props like Carrot Top with His treasure box
I've been rocking while you're just getting your cherry popped
And every spot is my stomping ground triceratops
Start off every morning with Bloody Mary's and Mary Jane
End every night with a flock of birds canary gang
I'm very spaceship you're very plain
Your Mary Kate and Ashley's are actually very same
It's hard to tell apart, now watch me teleport
Towards the top of the charts it's in the tarot cards
Twenty four carrot bars, platinum punch lines
Lets have fun, half drunk blunts and sunshine

Yeah
