Don't you ever worry about your pastor being rivaled or worried or unsettled or unnerved. I sleep fine. Too many people worried about, uh, uh, uh - somebody the other day asked me, they, uh, this, this reporter, he said, um, "I heard that you," um, "that you wouldn't - that it'd be a cold day in hell before you get your theology from a woman." It'll be a cold day in hell before I get my theology from a woman. I'm a preacher. Was it "Mama called, Papa said"? No woman ever got me involved in ministry. I didn't follow a woman in the ministry. A woman didn't write this book. Not one woman wrote the scriptures right here! A man wrote the Bible! Got it from God! A man hung on the cross! His name is Jesus Christ! And God called a man to lead the church here! Hey! I'm glad I'm a man!
