Who confused our economy for the Blue Collar Comedy
They got billion dollar jokes and two dollar apologies
That right there, that’s funny
Smack a dummy to fix stupid, looters cash money then git ‘er done
Where will you hide when the revolution comes?
When the banks get ganked and you lose your funds?
When the neck that gets red from the noose that is hung
On the branch of the family tree is your sons
Deadbeats walking livewires in dire times
Risking life and limb to say ‘That ain’t no child of mine!’
While the poor kids try to call dibs from the drinking time that’s all fit from vile faucets
Hide the forests from guys with corporate tax cuts
They claim death is an expense even before the axe struck
I’m actually inspired to have canned goods stacked in my cupboard
Half the world’s on fire the other half is flooded
We let the flames build
We remind ourselves they’re all dead, they’re all gone, they’re all killed
They’re not though
And they rise from the toxins
Running their marathon with no finish line in Boston
We occupied empty fanfare
The waterline was rising and all we did was stand clear

Every time you hear that man you cry (From the origin)
You run from school with teardrops in your eye (To the descent)
Every time you hear that man you cry (From the origin)
You run from school with teardrops in your eye

From the origin of species to the descent of man I present this plan
Come from protecting represent this land
If it fails us ‘c'est la vie’
And if you feel crushed then hate on me
Cause I’mma fly off the handle by the seat of my pants
Hold a fire to my candle try to leave with your hands
See the dance of the flickering flame spark your interest
The answer is simple- plain dark and intent
I won’t invest in reactionary kneejerks
There’s Chinese blood on your Che Guevara t-shirts
‘Me first! Me first!’ mentality gimme gimme
Every single form of government works in theory
I take your life’s deeds and I put em on paper
Apply equations to that shit to make me seem like your savior
Til you all see- nature’s a manmade wasteland
With a God that’s recycled, modernized and replaced again
(Yeah, man)

Every time you hear that man you cry (From the origin)
You run from school with teardrops in your eye (To the descent)
Every time you hear that man you cry (From the origin)
You run from school with teardrops in your eye (To the descent)

Every time you hear that man you cry (From the origin)
You run from school with teardrops in your eye (To the descent)
Every time you hear that man you cry (From the origin)
You run from school with teardrops in your eye
