[Sage Francis]
My name is Sage Francis
Hello Saadiq
And my man, DJ Abilities, brought in the beat
We're about to creep up into a freestyle cipher
My man right here, he brought the lighter
Wanna see me blaze one
You can't take Sage, son
He's amaz-un!
Come here, share my mic
Wanna hear you get hype
(What's up with the, uh, the distortion, is that cool?
Is it all right with the levels and all that?)

[Aesop Rock]
Just keep it even six inches
Just to deal with your interests
I'm Aes Rock, I hate cops
It's simple
I stand for the Def Jux/Orphanage posse
And ya'll can't stop me
When I creep through the see-through styles
That got smashed through the glass
And backed off
I attack soft MCs too easily
MCs be sleazing up on my territory
I scare 'em with the glory
It's all my allegory
As the story's told from the city that's cold
Minneapolis
Tackle this like it's all good
Coming from a tall hood
Yo 'Print, you on the mic with me?
What's up baby?

[Blueprint]
Hi everybody
Let me introduce myself
Deduce myself
Blueprint, speak to the newest health
Fly with it, fly exhibit
It's way past your rhyme limit, speed limit
Weak MCs is timid
They're weak with it
They grab the mic, I frequently freak with it
Tickle it, riddle kids with illness
Grab the mic, can you feel this?
Hold my mic like my dick
Might trip out on your girl
Slap her across the face with it
Your flow is basic
You're about to get laced with it
Printmatic, flow-tratic, go at it
For ten minutes or more
I'm getting ready to finish
And you're barely starting to score
Ten rounds more
I'm like seventy pounds more at the weigh-in
Bitch-ass MCs is soft, stay patient
Datin' 'em
Drunk 'em off with the date rape drug
MCs ain't thugs
I scope them out
Go about my business in an orderly fashion
Mashin', smashin', askin'
Catch they ass cause they're has-beens
They never have been
Fuck it, I'll take it a step further
Mic murder
Sorry about cussin' over the air
Flowin' over the stair
Eyed' is over my left
And I bring it def

[Eyedea]
I bring it def, I bring a rapper to his death
I guarantee no MC could ever step
Because the first time he hears my beat
He bobs his head and breaks his neck
I take his reputation when he's facin'
On the mic he's never patient
When he's takin' and he's breakin'
So erase him from the basement
You know MCs is facing
I erase 'em with my pencil
And the instrumental with the stencil
I beat their mental and defeat the wack
Eat 'em up like lentils and rice
I'm bendin' the mic
You spendin' your life trying to bein'
Me and your wife
But huh, we in the same bedroom
So give me head-room
Let me just consume
MCs feel the boom like:
BOOM BOOM
He's the dopest on the planet
That's why MCs swing from my nuts like a hammock
Like schwing
Swing back and forth like a yo-yo
I got the flow, yo
I can even do it in slow motionnn
Listen to the way he flowin'
Smoother than the ocean
And rub it on like lotion
All over their skin
If they're flowin' they winnin'
Not: they losin'
Rockin' bruisin'
Got to use
I messed up, yo
Even though I'm chokin' on my, um, mint
Listen to the style
In your pocket like lint
I bent MCs who think that they can transcend
Space and time, I break their rhyme
My friend up from the pig pen
And that's the dirtiest place
Nerd gets ripped out of the microphone
I take it from the face
Feel the bass
Yo that's what
My man Illogic just walked in the room
When we talk we consume
MCs ain't understanding
I'm human from the box
Not assumin' I'm a human
But you know I just will rock
In a room and my man Sage Francis is next
So grab the microphone and let go
Get a fresh flow

[Sage Francis]
Let the friend flow
Jump into the river
Kid that jumped out, though
Started doing that silly little dance
Like he lost his spine
Forced a rhyme to come out of his mind
His brain started to explode
Put him into sex mode
The went down to the commode
Flushed the toilet
Didn't mean to spoil the situation
But I know that kids in this nation
Are heading to the foster home
I'm not a member of the Orphanage
But when I'm done, that's where I toss the kids
I kill their parents, kill their balance!
Came back to knock them off balance
Chicka-chick - GOOD!
I go to your neighborhood and clear it out
Run up inside of the building
Then I take out the rest of the children
Then I start filling coffins that are man-made
Who's this man Sage
Francis? And he's got the answers to the questions
That have never been asked
Couldn't get surpassed on the highway
This is my way
Why would the flask even be filled up
With the liquid that comes from my mouth and oral?
They want to battle; nah, they want to quarrel
You want an argument
But they can't come as hard as this
Who else wants some of this?

[Slug]
Wait wait, wait a minute Mr. Sage Francis
I just want to ask you one question
What's up with all the rhymes that you have in your possession?
Tell me something:
What you got going on? What are you running?
How do you do it so quick?
How do you do the rhymes cunning?
Answer my question, just cut me off
It doesn't matter about the flowing until the break of north
Of south, of east to west
Who be the best
All we want to do is relieve some of the stress we possess

[Sage Francis]
Yo, some of this stress could just be relieved
If you could come around with the rest of these MCs
And please let rhymes out of your head
And if it leaves you dead, then fine
That's all you needed to have said
Since you were born, the word was borne
Or maybe the word was hatched
It didn't matter cause the thoughts got dispatched
They came up out of the head like a crack does an egg
The yolk was drippin' from the nose
They know the flows could come from within me

[Illogic]
Hold up, hold up, let me step in to the circle
Hurt you, turn your face purple, work you
Town, down, the city
It's me, gritty and grimy
Rhymin' Illogic you can't find me
Stymie, heh, twins
MCs stepping to me, I got mad ends
Fucked your friends
Can we curse on the radio? I'm sorry
Oh no, never step to me if you're warring
On some other ish
Some other kids mashed your ... punk-butt into some other....

[*laughter*]

[Slug]
Where does it come from and tell me what you saw
Maybe I ain't got that much rhythm
I've got bad hearing as well
But I've got really good vision
Everything that I see in front of me
Is everything I want to be
So tell me what you want from me
I'm just having a good time
Trying to kick out some good rhymes
Yes we can climb this mountain and hound 'em
All down to the bottom of the underground
To the top of the surface
It doesn't matter
I'll be the elephant in your circus
Spinning around in circles until my head turns purple
Until I can't breathe
Until ya'll leave
Until I, behave incorrectly
All I want to do is inject me with the rhymes
Infect me with the rhymes
Dissect me with the rhymes
Wreck me with the rhymes
Correct me with my rhymes!
If I'm incorrect with my rhymes, it doesn't matter
Just as long as you hit the deck
When you hear me and the crew hit the set
From the Orphanage....
