[Sample]
I don't know if it's the pretty face
Or the expensive taste

[Verse 1: n8ball]
Hi, how you're doing? My name's Nate, can I take your order?
Just a large soda that's a dollar and a quarter
Customers come and go like seasons of the year
Fat paycheck at the end of the week's the reason why I'm here

Mix powder with water and it turns into gravy
Pour that all over your motherfucking food, we do the chicken right  baby
Serving more wedges than a rebel alliance
Fleet of X-Wings, honey barbecue rings
Customer complaint pierce my ear like a ring

We got all the secret spices and herbs, working for the Colonel
Popcorn chicken, similar to popcorn, but it got no kernels
Here's your cup and a straw
No skill lacking, ever customer service slacking

Kid you know I'm packing, coleslaw
If there's time to lean, then it's time to clean
Team KFC makes the barbecue beans
The boost spray and wipe down the window and doors

Do my job keep from the firing squad
M-O-P the floors
Sweep up the bathrooms clean the poop off the seat
In the bathroom shoot a few hoops with the leftover meat
Clock out for the night, it's the end of the day
Grab a parfait as my employee meal and I'm on my way

[Hook]
Butter for your biscuit, biscuit macaroni and cheese
Everybody wants a little KFC
Come down, buy a bucket, you'll get to meet me
Everybody wants a little KFC
For only six bucks you can eat at the buffet
Everybody wants a little KFC
Tender roast extra crispy original
Everybody wants a little KFC
