People seem to be real curious
What it's like living the life
Of an underground super star

I awake around eleven or so with a kitten in my face
And that's not innuendo
I shake the cobwebs out my head
Live alone so I don't bother making the bed
I change sheets once every other week
Making four cups of coffee before I brush my teeth
Should I shower? Hell no
Use a little baby powder to cover the smell though
Check the cell phone. Ring out! Ring out!
To hell with these text messages from Twitter
Gonna block QuestLove. I ain't hating his game
I'm just not ready to play
Simple and plain. Everything's strange

Strange. Fame. Makes a man take things over
Things are getting
Strange. Fame. Lets him loose, hard to swallow
The business is
Strange. Fame. Puts you there where things are hollow
Even homies get
Strange. Fame. Strange, baby!

My oven is busted
The bathroom sink's in the fritz
And my dryer's broken so my clothes stink
The fridge stopped workin (Workin!) and it ruined my food
We beat the shit out of it and put the video on YouTube
People made comments like:
"Is this what people do because it's boring in Providence?"
No. It's what I do because I'm excited
And I don't have time to refute your writings

Go get out my business
I ain't paying for 1000 listens
I ain't clearin no sample for this song
I just give it away
David Bowie ain't my homie
Is that strange?

Strange. Fame. Makes a man take things over
This industry's
Strange. Fame. Lets him loose, hard to swallow
The lawyers get
Strange. Fame. Puts you there where things are hollow
Even my fans get
Strange. Fame. Fame. Fame. Fame. Fame. Fame

Don't give yourself to these unnatural men
Machine men with machine minds and machine hearts
You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men

I got the world at my fingertips
But me an my girl got some shit to fix
We battle on Facebook, updating the status
When I was on Friendster my friend said
MySpace was fuckin full of bigots
Now they talk about Widgets
Wikipedia won't even let me correct the false tidbits
Of info on my own bio page
Like I don't know my name
Like I'm the ripe old age of fiddy-somethin
So be it
Download my dick!
Don't give me nothin. I don't need it
Cause the more that I get, the more people complain
That they should have shit, like I have shit
That shit's strange

Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame. Fame. Fame. Fame
You gotta hope for the best and expect the worse
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
This one is free. Next time better empty your purse
Got kids to feed. in the future..
..personal life..
..total stupidity that I have to deal with
On a day to day basis..

Greed has poisoned men's souls
Has barricaded the world with hate
Has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed
Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want
Our knowledge has made us cynical
Our cleverness, hard and unkind
We think too much and feel too little
Don't give yourselves to brutes
Men who despise you, enslave you, who regiment your lives
Tell you what to do, what to think, or what to feel
(What's your name?)
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world
Millions of despairing men, women and little children
Victims of the system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people
To those that can hear me I say do not despair
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed
The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress
