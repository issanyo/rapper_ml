[Intro] [Sample of a man talking]
...tension, that kind of dialect between, what's out there in the popular culture
And what's going on in the more traditional...arts
Then you have something that is mind blowing

[Verse One] [Sage Francis]
I see the moon rise before the sun got a chance to set
I use God's tool to play a game of advanced Roulette
The romance of sweat got me feelin' things I can't forget
I question life but ain't been asked for answers yet
Inventing dance steps

[Vocab]
Your man slept
On my appearance and got his pants wet

[S] My third eye will magnify while you get burned just like ants get
[V] Spread the message, period, but haven't felt the cramps yet
[S] But yo, you're lookin' bloated but you know kid I canceled your check
[V] I wish this underground art would have kept its
Origin and essence
Fuck a Lexus, champagne and a diamond necklace
Yo, stop being restless
Commercialism's hip hop's death wish
I battle both sex for a Rolex on your left wrist
[S] Just to show y'all what time it is
[V] Vocab is divine with his
[S] Sage is who this rhymer is
[V] Y'all be lyin', we're just tryin' to live
[S] Cause MCs
Run some crazy shit
Rappin' like they're in a Scorsese flick
Lazy with their lyrics
[V] Raise your spirits
[S] Cause they're sellin', the audience is buyin'
The predicament that I’m in, they’ll be rhymin’ in I-talian
[V] It's all Greek to me
[S] So I'll flip it in Sicilian
Millions of civilians became Godfathers with no children
[V] Microphones are placed with cigars
[S] Kids in bars
[V] Thinkin' they're hard
[S] Singin' wack songs
[V] But won't listen to ours
[S] Yo they won't listen to ours
[V] I heard the system in their cars
[S] Bumpin'
[V] A whole lot of nothin'
[S] Makin' me hold the mic like prison bars

[Hook] [Both]
Ignorance has been driven to far
It's givin' my wisdom a Scar like the one on your Face
Smokin' izm with y'all
That ain't the system of Allah
Ha ha
I love God, while you love to drop bass
[V] I heard that Sage Francis, he loves to drop bass
[S] I heard that Vocab was so bad that cracker dropped bass
[Both] Non Prophets, awe shit, we never drop bass
Too busy pickin’ up the treble cause levels are out of place

[Verse Two] [Vocab]
While heads disgrace I catch a redface from stress signals
The music’s just a way to make the women’s ass and chest jiggle
Most of these rap stars can pass as sex symbols
More publicity, when the industry flash the next single

[Sage]
It's simple but you don't know if they laugh with or laugh at you
[V] Specifically, past issue
Their activity is ass tissue
[S] Son, I'd break their jaw but I'm not sure if it's glass or crystal
Blow a fast whistle on ass nipples who say they blast a pistol
[V] It's a cash scandal, their career is a juggling gamble
[S] Too much struggle to handle
[V] Our commercial ca-ca command you
[Both] Ca-Ca, commercial, command you, what?
[S] To be a trend
[V] To be a fad
[S] To be something brand new
[V] The origin was underground
Why'd they have to shape shift?
You went from up to down and couldn't elevate with a face lift
So, take this message as a tasteless breakfast
To feed your mind while Sage and Vocab made this checklist
[S] I'm no sexist
But rap tramps would rather blast stamps with a lap dance
[V] But they write their own lyrics!
[S] Fat chance
[V] But they think their own gimmicks
[S] No, creative control
When I'm in good spirits, maybe I'll save their souls
[V] When these days get cold
[S] I can hardly speak till I feel my girl's body heat
Manifesting the form of a hip hop beat
People swarm if they stop in the street
Before I'm gone I got 'em clappin' their hands and stompin' their feet
[V] They're torn
[S] Between what they like
[V] And what' they're told to like
[S] Never too old to fight
[V] If you're known to bite
[S] Then what's your soldier strike?
[V] I show the light
[S] But you don't know it right
[V] Cause someone stole your sight
[S] Leavin' my wisdom scared
[V] Like prison bars, that's how I hold the mic

[Hook] [Both]
Ignorance has been driven too far
It's givin' my wisdom a Scar like the one on your Face
Smokin' izm with y'all
That ain't the system of Allah
Ha ha
I love God, while you love to drop bass

We're too busy pickin' up the treble cause level's are out of place
[S] Level's are out of place
[V] Devil's are hard to trace
[Both] Hip hop is a disgrace
[S] No doubt, no doubt, level's are out of place
[V] But Devil's are hard to place
[Both] Hip hop is a disgrace no diggity
