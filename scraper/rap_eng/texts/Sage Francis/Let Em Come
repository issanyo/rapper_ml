[Verse 1: Scroobius Pip]
When it's cold, we bite the top of our zips
Pull it up with our teeth 'til it covers our lips
Then exhale; central heating for the weather beaten
No feet are beating, this street in to stand by us like Wil Wheaton
Walking these streets with that distant stare
No one likes us but we don't care
Maybe our kind don't fit round here
Our minds find conflict round here
See we choose to cruise a route that ain't paved with gold
So our shoes don't slip they stick and grip this road
Our tools are ink slicks that we engrave and mould
For an end goal you maybe can't spend or fold
We won't settle for unsought careers
Or forty years of salty tears
Like a battered up mix-tape with a long faded label
When I'm old and decaying I'll be decaying and able

[Hook]
If the bad times are coming, let 'em come
Let the death drum break the slump
Before the once young braves succumb
The fickle flicker of desire expires
If the bad times are coming let 'em come, let 'em come

[Scroobius Pip]
I see so many kids that love being writers more than they love writing

[Verse 2: P.O.S]
Bad times coming
Bash up a castle
I know the zoo keeper
Line em up
Lions on em
I haven't slept yet
Ever, crust
Kickin up dust
Leave em sickin up rust colour
Let it come
Let em run
Let me laugh at it
Smash like it's rampage
Live it up
Grasp at it
No pill for the whirlwind coming
Let it come
Spin with the rush no fun till the times up
Run against the flood
All stroke no float
For the hope for the coast pump blood
Stump fuckers on the daily
Dump lungs
Volume is up
Watch em hush for the lump sum
But not around here
Around here we steer clear
Of holding our tongues to stack funds
When bad times come it's like some old news
New shit
Choose yours
New whip or brick?
Thank you

[Hook]
If the bad times are coming, let 'em come
Let the death drum break the slump
Before the once young braves succumb
The fickle flicker of desire expires
If the bad times are coming let 'em come, let 'em come

[Verse 3: Sage Francis]
Quality home life, living a lie now
Take it to the road certain women would lie down
Haunting images I witnessed in my town
Are floating through the night with a knife and a white gown
Gotta dig a bigger hole
But I can never climb out, just burrow and burrow
Or stand on the high ground while pulling the sky down
Wait for the high tide and try not to drown
You're waiting another day with eyebrows furrowed
Just say what you gotta say... like right now, fucko
Or pipe down bucko, I'm doubting what many say
"Why do you think they call it a burrowing owl  anyway?"
Feed the lion despite what the sign says
Act defiant and impolite to my friends
While making side bets in a risky gamble
Save the wild sex for the filthy animals
I switch the channel if the nature turns mechanical
Become detached like your snake mandibles
The slack jawed yokel is practising his cat calls
It's got the lab rats bounding off the padded walls

[Hook]
If the bad times are coming, let 'em come
Let the death drum break the slump
Before the once young braves succumb
The fickle flicker of desire expires
If the bad times are coming let 'em come, let 'em come
