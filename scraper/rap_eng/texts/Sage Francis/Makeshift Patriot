[Intro]
I’ve heard enough of you young fellas, who think you know it all
You know nothing, you have not seen a shot fired
And you’re waving the damn flag
Frank, what’s up man?
Watchin' some bullshit, on the news
Fuckin' bullshit. Reporters, tryin' to win a fuckin' Emmy

[Hook]
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself via live telecast

Coming live from my own funeral
The beautiful weather offered a nice shine
Which is suitable for a full view of a forever-altered skyline
It's times like these I freestyle biased opinions every other sentence
My journalistic ethics slip when I pass them off as objective:
"Don't gimme that ethical shit."
I've got exclusive, explicit images to present to impressionable American kids
And it's time to show this world how big our edifice is

That's exactly what they attacked when a typically dark-skinned Disney villain
Used civilians against civilians and charged the Trojan horses into our buildings
Using commercial aviation as instruments of destruction
Pregnant women couldn't protect their children
Wheelchairs were stairway obstructions
Now I have to backpedal from the shower of glass and metal
Wondering how after it settles we'll find who provided power to radical rebels
The Melting Pot seems to be calling the kettle black when it boils over
But only on our own soil so the little boy holds a toy soldier
And waits for the suit and tie to come home. We won't wait till he's older
Before we destroy hopes for a colder war to end
"Now get a close up of his head"

Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself while the stock markets crash

The city is covered in inches of muck
I see some other pictures of victims are up
Grieving mothers are thinking their children are stuck
Leaping lovers are making decisions to jump!
While holding hands, to escape the brutal heat
Sometimes in groups of the three
The fallout goes far beyond the toxic cloud where people look like debris
But all they saw after all was said, beyond the talking heads
Was bloody dust with legs looking like the walking dead calling for meds
Hospitals are overwhelmed. Volunteers need to go the hell home
Moments of silence for fire fighters were interupted by cell phones
Who's going to make that call to increase an unknown death toll?
It's the one we rally behind
He's got a megaphone, and he's promising to make heads roll
So we cheer him on, but asbestos is affecting our breath control
The less we know, the more they fabricate. The easier it is to sell souls

Talking Interlude:

"There is a new price on freedom, so buy into it while supplies last
Changes need to be made: No more curbside baggage
7PM curfew
Racial profiling will continue with less bitching
We’ve unified over who to kill, so until I find more relevant scripture to quote, remember; our God is bigger, stronger, smarter and much wealthier
So wave those flags with pride, especially the white part"

We sell addictive 24-hour candlelight vigil in TVs
Freedom will be defended at the cost of civil liberties
Viewers are glued to television screens
Stuck, cause lots of things seem too sick
I use opportunities to pluck heart strings for theme music

I'll show you which culture to pump your fist at, and what foot is right to kiss
We don't know who the culprit is yet, but he looks like this
We know who the heros are. Not the xenophobes who act hard
"We taught that dog to squat
How dare he do that shit in our own back yard!"

They happened to scar our financial state and char our landscape
Can you count how many times so far I ran back this same damn tape?
While a cameraman creates news and shoves it down our throats on the West Bank
With a ten-second clip put on constant loop to provoke US angst

So get your tanks and load your guns and hold your sons in a family huddle
Because even if we win this tug of war and even the score, humanity struggles
There's a desperate need of blood for what's been uncovered under the rubble
Some of them dug for answers in the mess, but the rest were looking for trouble

I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself, don't waive your rights with your flags
