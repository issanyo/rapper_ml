[Verse I]
I got nothing to teach the learning curve of your body
I got teeth that could hurt you probably
With one bite
A tongue with spikes, a rusty knife
I wish you'd take it from me
An gut me like a fish, up tight and selfish
Got a lust for life and a death wish
They're husband and wife and they
Fuck like they're helpless
Am I a product of uninteresting sex?
If I'm bored by your pillow-talk and Newport cigarettes?
She chews on fiberglass like a teething infant
He breathes in her stink and seems indifferent
She dreams of children
He hears the pitter-patter of little fetuses
He's like "stand by me
There's a leech in my briefs and it's bleeding like a stuck pig
Come quick!"
Think of a baby's name, she wanted to call it "Quits"
Imma name him Raymond and raise him
Like I don't know my own strength
And bench-press the baby naked
Hold it to the sky, like "look what I did!
It's mine, and you can't have it."
Until it rains, and when it rains
He sticks out his tongue to catch it
The baby stays
The baby stays

[Verse II]
He just stares into the abyss 'til the abyss blinks
Instincts pop up to the surface like pinpricks
Still flinch
Manhandle the kill switch
Peg meet square, get dismantled by drill-bits
The deconstruction of a functional addict
Leaving assumptions to a bunch of fanatics
It's just standard procedure
With a automatic pilot light
Hide behind a white lab rain coat cause the water broke
Press eject
First comes the head, then the neck
Then the body avalanches out the tape deck
Flappin' on the ground like a fish out of its element
No one wants to acknowledge the carnage, the mess or elephant
That's in the room
Connected to the womb with a lifeline
Labored all day through the morning noon and nighttime
Then we cut the cord, fully aware
What we keep on the inside's too personal to share
Now we hold it in the air, like "look what happened!"
If we throw it out with the bath water
Will you catch it?
Or let it go down the drain
If it goes down the drain imma snatch it
The baby stays
The baby stays

And I'mma hold it to the sky, like "look what I did!
It's mine, and you can't have it."
Until it rains, and when it rains
He sticks out his tongue to catch it
The baby stays
The baby stays
The baby stays
