She said forever..
I said forever?
Forever ever? forever ever ever ever ever ever ever?
Apparently forever only means four year!
This is the rewrite... this right here
This is the rewrite... this right here
This is the re-write, to anyone who has been fucked over in their life

This to the woman who I used to respect
Now I call her a bitch cause I'm constantly upset
So this is to the +bitch+ who cut communication
For a new relation
Selfishness spread through the nation
All I ever wanted was a hug
To wrap my loving arms around you, you blew it off with a shrug
So all I ever wanted was a hand to hold
I ain't the man to scold
Your plan is cold but god damn its old
It's about time get inside of my head while I'm out my mind
As I scream cry yell shout and whine
All I ever asked for
Was an ear to hear me
What you really have to wear that mask for?
You straight shattered my glass jaw
I'm picking up the pieces of my past, what you last saw
But see this, needless to say, you went astray
And all people ever hear Sage say is
I don't give a damn, I don't care
That's what I hear from myself tryin' to make things clear
Yeah, I don't give a FUCK for real I don't FUCKING CARE
You know why?

The pain stops with the end of raindrops
But this cloudy weather just reminds me of the time we spent together
And how you left forever like that with a snap of fingers
Pain lingers, this is to the
Woman who I made my family
Now I call her a bitch just to save my sanity
So this is to that +bitch+
She be right here, a monster in my reoccurring nightmare
Now when my grandfather died
And my grandmother died
And my dad fuckin' died
You saw me and just ignored me like "Sorry end of the story"
My family's dropping like flies somehow I got to rise
But nobody's by my side, can't look straight into my eyes
Nobody's by my side, look straight into my eyes
My fist grabs air, stare into the lies
I never felt more lonely, I made you the one and only
Individual to know me. This is the thanks that you show me?
I never felt more lonely, I made you the one and only
Individual to know me, never thought that you'd turn phony
But you did, I'm going all out kid
And I got mad hate to deal with
Yo,I'm having trouble letting anyone get close to me
And that's a major problem because that's not the way it's supposed to be
Supposedly, I should keep my composure
Right now, I'm like "wow", it's time for me to seek closure
Pictures are destroyed - overexposure
Ever get that feeling that nobody really knows ya'?
This is to the woman who I called my best friend
Now I call her bitch, because she made the switch to that +bitch+
Who I shouldn't disrespect
So now I call her woman just to keep myself in check
Fuck that
{this is the problem that's all inside my head
She said to me "the answer's easy if you take it logically"
I'd like to help you with your struggles to be free

Without calling her a bitch
