I got rap control with a whack patrol
In a industry where they give me cash for soul
I ain't buyin' into the fashion show
I got a big foot, I could kick your whole asshole
Spaghetti, spaghetti, tuna casserole
They force all their rhymes while I grab his balls
They don't care what I have to show
I'm lucky if a single of my albums goes Gold
Talkin 'bout Platnium Plaques you hold?
Like McDonalds talkin 'bout how many Big Macs sold
It don't matter, Fuck Yeah I jacked your flow
Ask Biggie and Pac how many raps you stole fucka
I'm just having some fun
For real, I ain't trying to have beef with anyone
6 million ways to die, choose none
I like 99 rappers but Jay-Z ain't one HIT ME!
If you hate Hip Hop i feel bad for you son
I like 99 rappers but Jay-Z ain't one
