AUTHOR: Sage Francis

By the time the flags rotted off of their antennas
They were questioning who the real threat is
Big Brotherly love is the 21rst Century's plague
No matter how bloody the glove, question evidence displayed

Don't forget what two plus two equals
Don't let them upgrade your math no matter what they have as proof of evil
Remember when they went after the Jewish people?
You don't recognize that same black mask as see through?

Attack of the eagles. If they don't fall dead
Before they reach me, I'll be damned if I don't shoot one in its bald head
Fuck what we're force fed. All I ever wanted
Was a warm bed and a house that wasn't haunted

I'd rather die for a cause than to die just because
We exhaust natural resources forced into wars
Restoring wasteful ways, keeping other countries poor
"Monkey see, Monkey do" I wonder what those fucking monkeys saw

Keep rethinking the still-frames in your mind
And guarantee they will change with time
Your outline is pixelated with poor resolution while
Downtime is simply wasted. You were born execution style

Head first in a trial. I'll second the motion
'Til the jury's bored to death and puts your neck in a notion
The situation's volatile. A naked problem child
Is trying to find the right clown costume to make his father smile

So he bombs while he tries to tell jokes
This ain't a false alarm, can't you smell the smoke?
You're in the line of fire where they buy and sell votes
Our sense of liberty doesn't ring true, stupid, that's why the bell broke

Trench coat Mafiosos propel rocks
At recruitment officers and rebel against cops
'Til they hurdle infinite circles in small cell blocks
Turtle upon turtle 'til they're all shell shocked

This so-called president got elected in a court room
With the war efforts of pops he inherited a fortune
We "talk, talk, talk..." so the veterans of war assume
The revolution stopped. This ain't a protest tune

"Hey, Bobby...the Masters are back. They're up to no good just like the old days
They played dead when you stood over their grave, Bobby. They played dead when you stood over their grave
"Hey, Bobby...them bastards are back. It's our turn to stand over their grave
I'm a do it right this time...I'm awake...I'm a wait until their fuckin' skin decays."

You can't roam a lost land as the last existing dinosaur
There's no escaping ass kickings in these times of war
Replacing apples with hospitals...where doctors are hostile
Killing two pterodactyls with one fossil

I got you. If they don't fall dead
Before they reach me, I'll be damned if I don't shoot one in it's bald head
Fuck what we're force fed. All I ever wanted
Was a warm bed...and house that wasn't haunted

Thumb through novels to have your fingerprints match
The description of criminals committing innocent acts
Of compassion for tired civilians crawling with pistols
While we fire million dollar warning missals

Force the issues in the back of your head where eyes roll
Brain wash yourself out of that mind control
Or act a fool like you're told
But we won't see no type of justice 'til that bitch removes the blindfold

This ain't a "Love it or leave it," it's a "Change it or lose it."
I'll never sing the anthem of a nation who never faces the music
Chasing an ever-elusive caveman
In space ships that makes trips to the futures that are name-brand

Faking progress...but we ain't advanced
Enough to change the posture of our ape stance?
They've got the key to the city but they prefer the break-in entry
Duck and weave, I'm shedding light in their shadow box to make it empty

"Hey, Bobby...the Masters are back. They're up to no good just like the old days
They played dead when you stood over their grave, Bobby. They played dead when you stood over their grave
"Hey, Bobby...them bastards are back. It's our turn to stand over their grave
I'm a do it right this time...I'm awake...I'm a wait until their fuckin' skin decays."

Attack of the eagles. If they don't fall dead
Before they reach me, I'll be damned if I don't shoot one in its bald head
Fuck what we're force fed. All I ever wanted
Was a warm bed...

There's nothing scarier than the human stories I tell ghosts
Chilling accounts with my tongue frozen to bed posts
The catharses of carcasses whenever threats are close
Shows a heartlessness that doesn't register on stethoscopes

Sell your hopes for a homeland security chart
'Til your sense of self is broke and no man's pure in the heart
Preventive detention for the folks who never left home
Tensions have grown into a 24/7 red zone

Scare tactics...have got you under control
The fear factors of a color code. The uppers know
They can't hold you down without having anchors attached
"It's all the same." Nah, balls and chains on ankles don't match

So drag your torso back to the off road
We may have lost the fashion battle but we ain't lost the wardrobe
Go window shopping for your next free meal
Cuz when we start the revolution all you'll probably do is steal

"Hey, Bobby...the Masters are back. They're up to no good just like the old days
They played dead when you stood over their grave, Bobby. They played dead when you stood over their grave
"Hey, Bobby...them bastards are back. It's our turn to stand over their grave
I'm a do it right this time...I'm awake...I'm a wait until their fucking skin decays."
