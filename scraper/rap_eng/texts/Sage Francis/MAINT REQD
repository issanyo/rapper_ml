[Hook]
MAINT REQD, push through the pain
What the flame does not consume consumes the flame
We're burnin’ at both ends, it's safe to assume
What doesn't consume the flame the flame consumes
MAINT REQD, push through the pain
What the flame does not consume consumes the flame
Burnin’ at both ends, we're hoping and praying for rain

[Verse 1]
Listen: a lie is just a lie: if you believe it they'll believe it
Otherwise it's just some sly legal speak, so we keep our secrets
I wrap mine up in a silk robe
They prance around the home like princesses obsessed with kissing every toad
But ain't no prince here
In fact, I had to slay the dragon I was chasing for the warts to disappear
And dissect the frog, cut through the fog and do my thing
In the land of the pigs, the butcher is king
This is two-hundred and sixty pounds of ground meat in a town sound sleep
Countin' cards while they count sheep
Now I'm on a sacrificial lamb, it's collapsing an iron lung
Had to remove the mask and ask what kind of trash am I among
Caught in the widow's web the black spiders spun
Taking a beating that’s so ancient that it's basically a tribal drum
I'm seeing stars and constellations
Seeing warning signals in the universe's dashboard they're all saying

[Hook]
MAINT REQD, push through the pain
What the flame does not consume consumes the flame
We're burnin’ at both ends, it's safe to assume
What doesn't consume the flame the flame consumes
MAINT REQD, push through the pain
What the flame does not consume consumes the flame
We’re burnin’ at both ends, we're hoping and praying for rain

[Verse 2]
Paint me like one of your French girls
Use my neck as a scratch post to rip out every last one of them red curls
Knit me a sweater with the intestines of attention whores
I’ve no expectations of the tribe I'll have to settle for
Circular logic is foul talk (It’s mental sex for sport!)
Abuse me like customer service (I'll be your tech support!)
I'm sorry to hear you're having problems
It must be difficult.  Let me see if I can help you like… figure 'em out
Have you listened to Biz Mark's "Just a Friend"?
Have you tried turning me off and back on again?
If you Make-A-Wish on a foundation, there's maintenance required
All I ask is you be careful when you state what you desire
They said Satan is on fire without breaking a sweat
All that pagan shit is tired, so I'm taking a rest
I met my date at the pyre.  She was shorter than I like
But wore a dress that's as long as the night.  Then I saw the light

[Hook]
MAINT REQD, push through the pain
What the flame does not consume consumes the flame
We're burnin at both ends, it's safe to assume
What doesn't consume the flame the flame consumes
MAINT REQD, push through the pain
What the flame does not consume consumes the flame
Burnin’ at both ends, we're hoping and praying for rain

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I’d settle on a bed of rusty nails instead of roses
Cause a thorn by any other name is so honest
So forth and so what, I got blood on my mattress
Got a harem full of knife throwers who use my back for target practice
I fucks with them budget types
Inherited this cutlery along with the scars, and they all look alike
Used to write confessions in between the lines
And wear long sleeves so no one else could read my mind
Now I exercise my right to bear arms when I write words
The last polar bear taking a final stand on a melting iceberg
Where nothing is exclusive—when holding confidence
Sex could get abusive—but everyone consents
Anything that’s lucrative—gets reduced to checks
And now you’re wondering where your fair share of the bit of profit is
Sorry kids, the piggy bank's depleted
Had a million dollar smile, but not the pretty face that’s needed
I’ve seen toward me, doggy, I’ve never tapped a bottle or twisted the cap whenever they passed the forty
I’m fat boy disorderly.  Nothing fun about obesity
But recently, I toyed with it morbidly
Cordially invite you to the incredible, mind that bends metal
No spoon is safe, no fork is too special
Essentially we all know how the story ends
How heavily the plot twist depends on a little bit of
Maintenance, maintenance, maintenance

[Outro]
My house bitches lololololololololol
