Maze broken

She's runnin'

Feet swollen

He's commin'
She's stolen

And before he even knows it she's gone

Tea cups sittin' on the hollow tree stumps
He's dumped, and can't seem to swallow these lumps

The best goes on...

Same fire

New passion
Old flame

Trade it in for a summer fling

There's nothing like that sweet old song...

Tip over

Root the trees
Bend the leaves

Blend in with the open wound

The freeze frames keep him warm...

The day's frost is scrapped off the weight loss

The new sign that says keep off
As he speeds off into the storm...

Out of sight the lighting strikes him twice

He's peeking out on the pike and cheatin life

Pealing out on the lawn

Now he's idling
In his mind he's figuring out life's about the little things
His time is dwindling

And his labyrinth

And all his magnificent can only keep the mike straps
The princess is innocent

She doesn't belong...

(I never thought I'd miss you)

They had a ceremony where he put her in a bridle, the headstall...
She stop to think for a minute, and in a split second went a wall

(I never thought I'd miss you)

He draws in the chin as in a expression of resentment or scorn

He's pullin' on the rains, the bridle, the shower the storm

The maze, the high tower, clouds are at war...

The rains, the bridle, the shower, the storm...

The maze, high tower, clouds are at war...

The rains, the bridle, the shower, the storm...

The maze, the high tower, clouds are at war, clouds are at war, clouds are at war...
