That's dope, that's fresh

The way you boil Broccoli
Its texture, the color is so wonderful
I'm simply amazed
As a housewife right now

Why don't you serve this to George Bush?
You know, he once told the press
That he wasn't too crazy about Broccoli
And it actually made the news

I never imagined Broccoli
Could be put together
With something so sweet like this
And the yogurt isn't so overpowering either

To think he went to the extent of being
Well, you could say, an evangelist of Broccoli
An ambassador of some sorts
Now, that's just greatness, really?
