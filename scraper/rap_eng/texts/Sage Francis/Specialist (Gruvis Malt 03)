The one that I'm with thinks sex is a beautiful thing
And that's simply adorable
When my time is affordable
Dimes pay the price I get abusive and that's the truth
It's just a fucking shame this is how I choose to communicate
Excuses I produce have their roots in the music I make
She's not a fan nor am I famous
I may just change and adjust when I branch out
Leave, get off my damn couch and achieve
What I dream about leave my house hand out my keys
To the sleepless beauty who failed math class and can't count her Z's

The tree dies
She says that she's mine she's my proprietress
Can't hold on to most of what I owned
Besides she likes to kiss and that's cute
I hug her till I start to hurt her
She wants to dance to my pulse but I've got heart murmurs
A shark circles our lifeboat till its fin folds
The monster we created might choke in clothes
I'm naked walking tight ropes without big toes
Couldn't see this with the night-scope bid my skin glow

Fallen
Calling for a safety net
The great white might drain me of my life
Bite into my veiny neck where dreams are falling asleep
Could dry up once she sees that I bleed off beat
Head over heels cause she's tripping on her own feet
That puzzled look on her face still isn't complete
She gives bits and pieces of herself
While I'm breaking myself open I pour my contents to her shelf
Pardon me but is that me wearing my heart out on my sleeve
With razor sharp teeth gnawing at my wrist how beautiful is this
The most beautifulest thing in the world
Is making up words when I have none else left to say to a girl
Making her curl up in a ball in a corner of my eye
Taking a time out I don't want her to cry
I don't ever want to be considered the sort of guy
Who says, "I just might break your face tonight"

I spread my love like the legs of a crack whore
We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple
You dance around me like a fire blow me away, blow me away
I spread my love like the legs of a crack whore
We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple
You dance around me like a fire blow me out
When I send you love poems in the form of smoke signals

Over average marriage materialist mister righteous
A savage miscarriage of just us just us
And a dust that never settles
I'm restless spread some metal to make it weep
Cause discussing the ugly nobody wants to fuck with
Don't touch me
Under appreciative with a with a hundred weaknesses
What do I need to live?
The blood I bleed is thicker than the skin I shoot people with
Need a fist to the air
Pretend to make believe she cares
To open up old wounds and usual bruises on my ego up here
I'm a low self-esteem engine in need of a horsepower
Out of sleeping powder
Dark clouds follow me with heat seekers
I need a colder shower
To showboat when exposes my phonetic quest
Cause it won't float if it turns out these are permanent echoes in his chest
I think its best to turn the reverb down
Kill the delay
Get me the fuck out of this cave

I could paint you pictures all day
I'm not gonna pander to Neanderthals that way
I'm not gonna pander to Neanderthals today
The one that I'm with thinks sex is a beautiful thing
She thinks I'm something special
She's my specialist
More beautiful than sex
Cause only something like sex
Makes something so lovely turn ugly and fuck up shit
I'm holding a sleepless beauty pageant
On my shark-infested waterbed until it's punctured

I spread my love, spread my love, spread my love until I pull a muscle
I spread my love, spread my love, spread my love until its see through
Spread my love like the legs of a crack whore
We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple
You dance around me like a fire
Blow me away blow me away blow me away blow me away

I spread my love like the legs of a crack whore
We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple
You dance around me like a fire blow me out
When I send you love poems in the form of smoke signals
