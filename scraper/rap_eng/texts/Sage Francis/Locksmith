[Verse: Sage Francis]
Dade county
Miami, 1976
A baby boy living in a hotel with his parents
Mommy was a maid there, don't really know what pops did
But, he was training to be a locksmith
We moved up the coast
Back to where the grandparents live
Perhaps for cash
I didn't think to ask as a kid
And I don't know where pops went, but things seemed stable
Even when he left his keys on the table
My single mom
She was able to make it
Without relationships
Every so often
Pops would show up and babysit
It never made me think about his day-job a lot
Until the day when my mom changed the locks
In those days
When he watched me
When I think back in some ways
Were, made up of coffee, six packs, and gun-play
Pornography and projects
Step-siblings and half-relatives
But having kids was bad for business
Girlfriends were the rage then
Babies in the playpen
Toddlers were plopped in front of television stations
There wasn't just one way to say things
Between the two households I outgrowed all types of combinations
Breaking these codes and peeking through keyholes
Finger on the pulse, stethoscope, stroke the needle
Put my ear to the ground and hear the pins drop
Gears in the clock turned like my stomach
Turned like the dial on a padlock
Rhode Island was the backdrop
The world was the oyster
Crack the shell
Hand the pearl over to the lawyer
In family court I make judgments
I'm a product of my father's trade
And my mother's substance

[Chorus]

[Verse: Macromantics]
1980
South Africa
Johannesburg
Little Lucy in the sky with the blackest birds
Where planets turn
Crash and burn
Her mother gave birth
Landed face first, Terra Firma, came to save Earth
But wait, first
She was raised there til '86
Parents altogether two siblings and a baby sis
Then fate had fixed the next stage of her destiny
The decision to move dad made it an [?]
They migrated to
The place that shaped her core
Time ticket taper wars, that caved towards herself
Introverted, binge and purge a dirge a spoon of hers
So she tried to make sense
Of the purdy doom and dirt
Of the universe
How she fit the pandemonium
Writing saved her life, she took the pen and pad and wrote in them
Sentences [?] structure and sufficiency
The one the got away from the usual fishes in the sea
Swum toward the underground of culture and mental webs
Erased bad thoughts and guilt she used pencil lead
To draw her own conclusions and
Shade in the absolutes
Finds herself in tracks and [?]
Damn that's the truth
She's come a long way
To be here this very minute
And continues until she meets her grave buried in it
Every instant is a [?] potential we control
She tries to capture the magic moments secrets hold
In the heart, emanating love and self-discipline
Right now she's standing in front of a well wishing in
Throws the keys down
Wow, head came and picked the lock
Time heals with open arms
Spread straight at six o'clock

[Chorus]
