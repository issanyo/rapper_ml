Lights flicker on the frame of a light sleeper...watching sports
In a stained wife beater and boxer shorts
Night creeps in-between the uneven slides of venetian blinds
And it sees signs of struggle

He resides in a jungle where the weeds dry and tumble
Every time he deserts love and leaves behind his troubles
This time it seems he's finally humbled;
Defeated by the feline he's been trying to subdue, beaten while they cuddle

Now subtle differences got him running from images
Weird as it is, circus mirrors are a serious fear of his
He stays a safe distance from the scary kid
His beard is big and he wears a wig in public appearances

Here he is...half alive in the flesh suit
Curious and appetized by the fresh fruit
Served on a dish at his nightly help group
Who dreamt of catching better Z's? Most people would've slept through it

If you ain't been through it, then you don't know the way the days
Just waste away. A change of pace needs to take place
I play with razor blades and I shake
Until I shave my face and the break....

Of day lights flicker on the frame of a light sleeper...watching sports
In a stained wife beater and boxer shorts
Sun rays creep in-between the uneven slides of venetian blinds
And it sees signs of struggle

He hides a bundle of demons behind the stubble
Sleep dehydrates him 'til the dreams dry and crumble
Bleeding from his eyes, the scene of the crime's a puddle
Where he cries Uncle...and doesn't realize he's lovable

Lover girl doesn't purr because she sees
Something of hers stuck in a world that needs to be freed
This cat's got tongues tied 'til she leaves
A curiosity that could kill an entire species

"See these fingers of mine?" Yes
"It's time to see if one of them fits the dark ring around your eyes," She says
So she sends me to a guy who signs permission slips
And if his finger fits...

He's going to poke inside to see what's alive
So I went to where she sent me only to find a blind man
With worn down fingertips
And his neck was a library full of razor bumbs
He placed a cup on a tabled labeled "Talk to Me"
And he snuck a smile passed the customs of his scruffy face
He just stared in my general direction and said...
