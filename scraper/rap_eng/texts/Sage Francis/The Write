This is to the woman who I loved but lost
Intertwined souls of the universe got divorced
But it wasn't forced. got single thoughts of being double crossed
Still there's no love lost

Now I can't even start this. I see no light inside the darkness
So whatcha want, miss? don't check my pulse because i'm heartless
You were my life support. And in a sense my defense fights the thought
I'll try to keep this one nice and short
Our four chambers beat in unison
I'm wanting you to listen to the dead silence in my defiance
I used to sin and be intrigued by violence
Now as I glimpse into the past I thank God for your guidance
Alas, I give my eyes a rinse
Blink and think in retrospect...realize you need to get your respect
I apologize as I holler cries
Cause it's you and not these college guys that keeps my knowledge wise
You're my crutch. but now I fall cause you're someone i can't touch
Now no one wants to help me up and that's too much
Even my wisdom fell. i'm in a living hell
Throw my inner child back in the prison cell
Incarcerated hatred is causing conflict
With the free love sentencing death to the convict
My soul is on skid row, where can this kid go?
I'm homeless, how could you notice when this whole world didn't know?
It's time i make public just how personal we got in private moments
Because lies are our opponents
Forget material or superficial stuff
I either let you know too much or not enough

This is to the woman who i loved but lost
Intertwined souls of the universe got divorced
But it wasn't forced. got single thoughts
Of being double crossed, still there's no love lost. There's no love lost

I can't pretend this. The impact on my life has been tremendous
It can't be fixed with a friendly kiss
What's endless?
Questions, pain, grief and misbelief?
I'm so faithful all I grind is my teeth
But what I find beneath the surface has changed from priceless to worthless
This three ring circus of clowning around is what hurts us
My brain short circuits as my mind starts to wander
To discover another lover. I'm isolated, living somber
She's whispering "come hither from there yonder."
I don't think i wanna. The pressure ain't gettin' lesser
Open my dresser...it overflows with memorabilia
Momentos of our success now symbolize my failure
I took time to write you diaries when we couldn't speak much
According to you that was a weak touch
Cause "actions speak louder than words." Turn up your hearing aid
You made this man afraid. Put the pin back in the hand grenade
There's not much time left til I'm left with nothing but a broken promise
While every syllable I said was spoken honest
We expected each other to be a physic mind reader
Don't tell me "life goes on." I need her...
Next to me...
So once again I can feel the high of ecstasy...
We tripped...walking down the aisle of destiny
Respectful sexually, because see...I understood
And I don't know too many people who would
Have done anything to get a laugh from their better half
I should have sensed it sooner...when you lost your sense of humor
Now let my soul speak, I couldn't eat for a whole week
With no sleep. The price I pay for being a control freak
Now I'm screaming inside my pillow instead of dreaming
I must have said "I love you" so much that it lost it's meaning
But no one's perfect, so where's my chance to make adjustments?
It's worth it...if our romance had substance
Because with purity we conceived marriage
Til insecurity caused a miscarriage

This is to the woman who i loved but lost
Intertwined souls of the universe got divorced
But it wasn't forced. got single thoughts of being double crossed...

I was in it for the long run
Now who's the weak and the strong one?
I tried to be Mr. Right, though things were wrongly done
But ummmm...When it was time for sacrifice
Straight up, you didn't have to ask me twice
I put off this rap device
I wasn't ACTING nice, all my feelings they were genuine
You got me open and I let you in
But now you're screaming bloody murder. Used the entrance as the exit
Now you're absent like my mind, i'm on a head trip
You never said shit. Used then misused the entrance
And never let me get in one sentence
Forget friends...you were my best one
Now I'm depressed, son. It didn't take long for the stress to come
Memories be my arch nemesis
As i sit and reminisce, wondering if you remember this:
Our genesis. First experiences on old dates
Got cold shakes and tingles, never single, we were soulmates
That term used to hold weight but now it's temporary
And lately I've been making trips to the cemetery
Ain't nothing evil in death, but this feels devilish
I'd never wish this on my worst enemy
Remember me
