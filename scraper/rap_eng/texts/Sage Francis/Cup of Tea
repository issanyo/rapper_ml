Every midnight we sit at the coffee table and we share a cup of tea
He stays up with me and we discuss things
Most of the time he just listens
Other times offers suggestions or he just ignores my questions
It gets more depressing as time passes
Every night I ask this one question
And all he does is wipe his glasses
It's aggravating as hell
I'm just waiting to tell
Whether or not he can even remember the answer
Whether or not he's choosing not to tamper with his memory
Whether or not he can even fucking remember me
What a waste of time!
But every night it's that same damn routine
One green cup of tea
And me stuck all by myself once its empty
And then I'm off to bed with plenty of caffeine to keep me up and thinking
The cup I'm drinking from is never clean
I can't remember if it's a dream once I awake and I walk
From my messy bed and anticipate our next late night talk

(You don't scare me
Why are you still sitting here
I'm not afraid of you
You are not intimidating!
What is it that you want from me
I'm not leaving
I want to stay, I want to stay...)

Every midnight we sit at the coffee table and we share a cup of tea
He stays up with me and we discuss things
Most of the time he just listens
Other times offers suggestions with his awful expressions
Altered reflections
His whole aura is see-through
With more confessions, I don't want to leave you
This cup should be bottomless!
As my insecurities spill
I see his face fading away, I surely need a refill
I purposely keep still and don't move much
Except to wet my lips with sips
With every kiss of death I lose touch
I sip the tea carefully
Because its at the degree of separation
Tasting the forked tongue in bilingual conversation
Waiting for his answer still
And at any given chance I will
Sweet and Low my bitter past, let the cancer kill the small talk
Alright man, this bitter taste in my mouth needs to get washed out
Ghosts in this house don't have anything timely to talk about
The concept is dead, there's nothing death should interrupt
I went to bed last night with one sip left in the cup
