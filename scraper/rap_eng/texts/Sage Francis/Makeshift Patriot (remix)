(People talking)
I'm tired of hearing of young fellows, who think you know it all
You know nothing, you have not seen a shot fired
And you're waving the damn flag

Frank, what's that man?

I'm just watching some bullshit
On the news. It's fucking bullshit
Reporters trying to win a fucking emmy

Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half mast
(3x)

It's the makeshift
The patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself for your live telecast

Coming live from my own funeral
Beautiful weather offered a nice shine
Which is suitable for a full view of a forever altered skyline
It's times like these I freestyle biased opinions every other sentence
My journalist ethic slips when I pass them off as objectives
Don't give me that ethical shit
I've got exclusive, explicit images to present to impressionable american kids
And it's time to show this world how big our edifice is
That's exactly how they attacked
When a typically dark-skinned disney villain
Use civillians against civillians and charge the trojan horse into our buildings
Using commercial aviation as instruments of destruction
Pregnant women couldn't protect their children;
Wheelchairs were stairway obstructions
I had to back-pedal from the shower of glass and metal
Wondering if after it settles
We'll find who provided power to radical rebels
The melting pot seems to be calling the kettle black when it boils over
But only on our own soil
So the little boy holds a toy soldier
And waits for the suit and tie to come home
We won't wait till he's older, though
Before we destroy hopes for a colder war to end
I'll get a close-up of his head

Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half mast
(3x)

It's the makeshift
The patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself while the stock markets crash

The city is covered in inches of muck
I see some more pictures of victims are up
Grieving mothers are thinking their children are stuck
Leaping lovers are making descisions to jump while holding hands
To escape the brutal heat;
Sometimes in groups of three
The fallout was far beyond the toxic clouds where people look like debris
But all they say when all was said
Beyond the talking heads
Was the bloody dust with legs
Looking like the walking dead calling for meds
All the hospitals overwhelmed
Volunteers need to go the hell home
Moments of silence for firefighters were interrupted by cell phones
Who's going to make that call, to increase an unknown death toll?
Its the one we rally behind
He's got a megaphone, promising to make heads roll
We'd cheer him on, but asbestos is affecting our breath control
The less we know, the more they fabricate
The easier it is to sell souls

(Man talking)
There is a new price on freedom, so buy into it while supplies last
Changes need to be made;
No more curbside baggage
Seven pm curfew
Racial profiling will continue with less bitching
We've unified over who to kill, so until I find more relevant scripture to quote
Remember, our kind is bigger, stronger, smarter, and much wealthier
So wave those flags with pride, especially the white part

We're selling addictive, twenty-four hour candlelight vigils on TV
Freedom will be defended at the cost of civil liberties
The viewers are glued to television screens, stuck
'cause lots of things seem too sick
I use opportunities to pluck heartstrings for theme music
I'll show you which culture to pump your fist at
Which foot is right to kiss
We don't really know who the culprit is yet
But he looks like this
We know who the heroes are
They're not the xenophobes who act hard
We taught that dog to squat
How dare he do that shit in our own back yard
They happen to scar our financial state
And char our landscape
Can you count how many times so far I ran back the same damn tape?
While the cameraman creates news and shoves it down our throats
On the west bank, with the ten second clip put on constant loop to provoke US angst
So get your tanks and load your guns and hold your sons in a family huddle
'cause even if we win this tug of war and even the score
Humanity struggles
There's a need of blood for what's been uncovered under the rubble;
Some of them dug for answers in the mess
But the rest were looking for trouble

Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half mast
(3x)

It's the makeshift
The patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself
Don't waive your rights with your flags

(Two people talking)
Seriously, if I want to find out anything, I'm not going to read Time Magazine
I'm not going to read Newsweek, I'm not going to read any of these magazines
I mean, because they've just got too much to lose by printing the truth
You know that

What kinds of truths are they omitting?

Well, anything
Even on a worldwide basis
They'd just go off the stands in a day if they printed really the truth

What is really the truth?

Well, really the truth is just a plain picture
