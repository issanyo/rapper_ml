[Verse I]
Had one too many one way conversations
With the licky-licky lord
'Till I grew a scissor tongue
And c-c-cut the cord
Put the phone on the floor
Detach the wires in my head
Took awhile to accept that that line was dead

[Hook]
Didn't never wanna not live forever [x3]
Didn't never wanna not not wanna live

[Verse II]
Nah, it didn't matter if the laughter didn't come after the bad joke
If i was down with the filthy rich or flat broke
Accepted by the Aryans or black folk
Cause i was carrying this weight until my back broke
Wasn't trying to be no hip hop god or raps G.O.A.T
Shootin' to be a rock star like its my last hope
Eyeballin' that pack of smokes, do me in!
Graduatin' on the crack coke, do me in!
Knocked of a paddle boat in the middle of the castle moat
Kings men are yelling GRAB THE ROPE!

Three sheets to the wind!
Three sheets to the wind!

[Verse III]
I talk like a sailor, my mother is one
That's why i got this sixth sense of direction and my split tongue
Taught me how to go with the flow when the winds come
Curled up in a ball and tried to hide inside a kick drum
While the crew is gettin' piss drunk i had to purify my own and drink up
I had to save and conserve recycle my salty words to keep the meat on my bones all pres-s-s-served

[Hook]

[Verse IV]
It was a tug of war and we all fought together
'Till we went our own way when the c-c-c-cord was severed
The stormy weather would begin, we'd all succumb to this sin
Any bar within reach, Three sheets to the wind
From a back pedal the backstroke got traded in my life jacket for a mask and cloak
Three sheets to the wind
I had to go, watch the sail grab the rope
See shanty ending on a sad note
Three sheets to the wind
Malnutrition (Pull me in)
Bad Religion (Pull me in)
Fact or Fiction that's addiction
Three sheets to the wind

[Hook]

Pick it up, put it down

[Hook]

Three sheets to the wind
