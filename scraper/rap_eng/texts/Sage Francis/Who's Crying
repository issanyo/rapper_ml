      Ay yo, cavemen used to drag their women by their hair
Because if they dragged
Them by their ankles
Their cracks would fill with sand
That ain't right
I go to the water park to show off my altered cock
To any whore in a halter top who likes to talk a lot
I force a sock into her mouth hole
Keep her gums from flapping
Strip her of her south pole
And bust a fucking backspin
On her north face
Turn this court case into a dragged out lawsuit
I’m attracted to her dad now he’s more cute
I heard the guy cums quick from hand speed
I’m a have to fertilize his stomach with my man seed
Implant trees
My broccoli crop needs watering
Cry your eyes out above my rotting crotch and feed it awful things
Love and affection
Pop the erection
She went down under I fed that Aussie slut some vegamite
Get in fights every night because of my heavy metal persona
With rapper stars but battle scars of my medals of honor
We’re rappers without a consciousness
I’ve had with all this pompous-ish
I’m just gonna’ get obnoxious with repeatedly calling your moms a bitch
