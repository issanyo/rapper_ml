[Intro]

[Sage Francis]

I have entered
This wonderful world of politics
Where white collar tricks got me on a proper fix
Til' they want me to talk about
Hollow tips, ganja hits and vodka sips
They got sick of topics like the apocalypse
So I start to mix lots of shit suggested by outsiders
Who should get off on the(?) open their mouths wider
I'd rather go down on the vagina of little Kim during her period
Then be forced to make a joke of my existence and be a silly kid
Who never questions the placement and purpose of each Egyptian pyramid
I'll stick to eccentric epics and construct another Iliad
Turn on my television and channel Homer
Ward off the evil spirits with some incense and candle aroma
That's not as sellable as a vandalist persona
So to hell with them
I'm a tough guy
Watch me crush this can of soda
Rrrr
Tin is putty in my hand
I'mma continue to sit over til' everybody understands
That sincerity is sincerely lacking in show biz
Talking about walking a route of evil giving your ho HIV's
I'd rather be having you walk the avenue of insight that my flow gives
When an MC records records question his motives
When a DJ plays that record question his motives
See you don't understand
I know kids who say they're addicted to sex
When in actuality they're addicted to sexual images
Masturbating
Their brain in intellectual scrimmages
Inside of every conceptual lyricist is a thug rapper
And in every gun-clapper there is a metaphycisist
Heads listen to this knowing there is truth in the sarcasm
But who's hearts spasm
When they hear us execute arts to the maximum potential
Blast an instrumental
Find a self professed freestyle king
And ask him to get mental
Confiscate his writing utensil
Dental records link the teeth marks he left biting his pencil to his crab actions
Another fraud is identified
Now when there are ciphers, he is no longer let inside
He shall remain an outsider
Feel the pain of a pariah
If you've got a closed mind
Then I'll open your brain wider
Say hi to your jock writin' counterparts
As I rip your town apart
With people you consider confidants
After my mantra starts
Bask in my nonchalance
And creates a relaxing ambiance
As I drip wax on your body parts
The rapture hardly stops
I capture hotties hearts with a spatula cause it's probably hot
Catapult some ish
To.. Milosevic
Til' he stops acting like such a bitch
Trying to make cultures switch
And that'll end the sorrow
Inside of Denver, Colorado
Servin' secrets you do not know
ADM spit a hot flow
