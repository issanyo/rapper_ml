[Verse 1: Ceschi]
Another year gone, stomach fatter, beard fully grown
Waiting for the nothing and I'm awfully alone
Sunday went and visited your grave
Put a wild rose on the Virgin Mary engraved
Mother sang her song, brother kneeled
And I just kept on wishing that the last year wasn't real

Teeth have sunk into my neck, teeth have sunk into my neck
Build us a holiday out of stones and holograms
Holy relics and hummingbirds all to fill this hollow man
I'm alright, I'm alright, but don't fuck with me tonight
These fists are clenched and I will fight for every breath left in this life
All the mosquitoes in Saskatoon couldn't quite suck the tough out of me yet
Although I know I'm a three-legged dog hopping and begging like Vietnam vets
These years were only appetizers swallowed quick and wet
But I will not forget the remnants that were left
Build us a holiday out of straw and out of sticks
Out of claws and out of bricks, out of gauze and spit

[Hook]
We're alive, barely alive, but we're alive
We're alive, barely alive, but we're alive
We're alive, barely alive, but we're alive
We're alive, barely alive, but we're alive
We're alive, barely alive, but we're alive
We're alive, barely alive, but we're alive

[Verse 2: Sage Francis]
I make a fist, stare at it and think
This is how big my heart is and I'm scared of it
'Til they use scissors to open my shirt
I go to work overworked
In the business of holding a smirk
Private jokes telepathically shared
From the present me to the past me
When I had more hair
The tub remains clogged
Sloshed through the memories of hooking up friends in need of jobs
Didn't stop them from requesting loans
It started with them calling me "Boss" in a condescending tone
Put an indefinite extension on the zero interest
Better business bureau better be damn well prepared to be impressed
We're reporting back to duty, heavily wounded
Steadily losing our gains
The enemy moves in
Gotta choose your weapons wisely
When I bust open my rib cage and I unleash the fist that's beating inside me
It'll punch more than clocks
Check your peephole, cause there might not be more opportunity that knocks
Door to door I'm selling artificial tears for your eyes
Using a stethoscope just to hear your cries
We're alive, barely alive, but we're alive...
Surprise

[Hook]
