This is to the woman who I loved but lost
Intertwined souls of the universe
Got divorced when it wasn't forced
Cause single thoughts of being double-crossed
Till there's no love lost
I can't even start this

She said forever..
This is the rewrite.. this is the rewrite
Yo, check this out!

This to the woman who I used to respect
Now I call her a bitch cause I'm constantly upset
So this is to the +bitch+ who cut communication
Caught in a relation
Selfishness? Best in the nation
All I ever needed was a hug
To wrap my loving arms around you, you blew it
Off with a shrug
So all I ever wanted was a hand to hold
I ain't the man to scold
Your plan is cold but god damn its old
It's about time get inside of my head while I'm out my mind
As I scream cry yell shout and whine
All I ever asked for
Was an ear to hear me
What you really have to wear a
Mask for?
You straight shattered my glass jaw
Now I'm picking up the pieces of my past what you last saw
But see this, needless to say, you went astray
All people ever hear Paul say is
I don't give a damn, for real, I don't care
Let's pull the hair from myself and try to make things clear
Yeah, I don't give a FUCK for real I don't FUCKING CARE
That's all I hear..

The pain stops with the end of raindrops
But this cloudy weather just reminds me of the time we spent together
And how you left forever like that with a snap of fingers
Pain lingers, so this is to the
Woman who I made my family
Now I call her a bitch just to save my sanity
So this is to that +bitch+ who I thought would be right here
She's just a monster in my reoccurring nightmare
Now when my grandfather died, you weren't there for me
When my grandmama died, you weren't there for me
When my natural dad died, you weren't there for me
You saw me and just ignored me like "Sorry end of the story"
My family's dropping like flies ???
Somehow I got to rise
But nobody's by my side, can't look straight into my eye
Nobody's by my side, can't look straight into my eyes
My fist grabs air, I stare in through the lies
I never felt more lonely, I made you the one and only
Individual to know me this is the things that you showed me
I never felt more lonely, I made you the one and only
Individual to know me, never thought that you'd turn phony
But you did, now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad hate to deal with
Just ask ???
I'm having trouble letting anyone get close to me
And that's a major
Problem because that's not the way it's supposed to be
Supposedly, I should keep my composure
Right now, I'm like "wow", it's time for me to seek closure
Mental pictures are destroyed - overexposure
Ever get that feeling that nobody really knows ya?
This is to the woman who I called my best friend
Now I call her bitch, because she made the switch to that +bitch+
Who I shouldn't disrespect
So now I call her woman just to keep myself in check
This is the rewrite..
