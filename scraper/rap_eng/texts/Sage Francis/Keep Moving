I keep moving, I keep moving
I keep moving I keep moving

I keep moving, I go from house to house
I stay committed like one foot in, one foot out
I bounce (bounce), yeah I'm leaving this place
Divorce papers falling out my briefcase

Miss intuition, the half truth harlot
Got her suspicions, lacks proof but wants it
I've been practicing grabbing the noose when the knot slips
Rewiring my mind to make the firing squad miss
And while they're busy reloading
I'm decoding the messages you sent with this key that I keep holding
But it's a copy and the lock seems broken
Got me choking on discussions I cannot keep open

I'm fully clothed in this cocktease moment
The last cigarette sits between my lips but I will not smoke it
And while it dangled I got strangled by a secondhand
Broke the rope, held my breath, and let my chest expand

Through the stogie, to the lonely hitman for hire
Told him he owed me, showed me that his hand's on fire
We didn't shake on it, he nodded, I nodded back
Lit the cigarette with his fingertip and dropped the gat

I started walkin the tracks you shoulda tied me to
Waited for the train to hop or stop to say goodbye to you
When I turned my head heard what you said
"Murder him dead, tried to do it with the girl in his bed"
So I fled, remembering one should never look back
There's no direction home only blood on the track
Stuck in the past, I jetted, I left the red footprints for them to follow
Headed for tomorrow where I take sips from a flask
You bought me for my sober anniversary
Her dad tracks my scent, she's got her old man in search of me
He knows where I'm headed, he's been there
King of the home, sits on his throne like it's an electric chair
I'm the heir to that domestic death sentence
I see people accepting lethal injections dead in seconds
They confuse prison for a bed and breakfast
Check my voicemail see you left a message

Could it be her, could it be? The desperate
Mad at me because they lack a strategy for exit
Huh, nobody pregnant, nobody get burped
I got lost on this head trip but I won't talk to an expert
My legs hurt cause I've been walking with cement boots
Ever since you lured me to the water bed to get cute
She had a wet suit and dry disposition
But couldn't execute this type of mission

It's no small time thing organizing my ending
My book of life is a choose your own adventure with a circular section
You told your friends I walked all over you
But you know that's not what these boots were made to do
In fact, you had them crafted at the store
You said, "Baby, put them on", I don't know what you take me for
Knew something was up when they got nailed to the floor
Since the key didn't work, I kicked my way through the door

I keep moving, I go from house to house
I stay committed like one foot in, one foot out
I bounce (bounce), yeah I'm leaving this place
Divorce papers falling out my briefcase

I keep moving, I go from house to house
I stay committed like one foot in, one foot out
I bounce (bounce), yeah I'm leaving this place
Divorce papers falling the fuck out my briefcase

I am no destination
I am just a journey
So don't go settling on me, love
No, don't go settling on me

I am no destination
I am just a journey
So don't go settling on me, love
No, don't go settling on me

I am no destination
I am just a journey
So don't go settling on me, love
No, don't go settling on me

Speak of me in your travels
Take pictures if you please
But don't go settling on me, love
No, don't go settling on me

Don't go settling on me, love
No, don't go settling on me

And I found something here I want you to have
It's not much, just a story, but it's all I got so take it
It's called Dylan
Dylan's drug of choice was "more"
So Dylan took more and more and more
Until the day he woke up babbleling in the pool of his own traffic jam
Realizing he is killing off the best parts of himself
And claiming he could read peoples skin

When he looked down at his heart flap, it said "boy, go find your spine, and ride it out of here."
