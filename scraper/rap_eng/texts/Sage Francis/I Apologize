      No one else make notes to know thyself
Those who loathe?...love them
Those who love?...show them what it is to loathe
If they don't show you love still...fuck em
Everyone's potential enemy who loves to diss
Virtual acquaintances only exist on a buddy list
I'll hug and kiss myself to sleep
While needing something else to eat
While needing someone else to feed
But eggshells are stuck in my feet

I'm sick of beating around the bush
While needing to push past creative limits
And I don't have anything else left to say to the critics
Is it just because we're different y'all can't stand it?
Or that I backstroke against the current and the culprit is aerodynamics?
Heroes might panic though I clown around to be the silliest...
Man alive, well I'm dead serious
Take me for a jokester and you'll only miss the punchline
Every friend of mine has dissed me at least one time
I've come to find life is consistently unkind
I've kissed the sunshine. sip it sometime until your lips become blind

Now i've lost it, or am I losing it, or did I never have it?
Aspirin addicts are avid advocates of happiness in tablets
They're adamant about their acid trip
I want a bite of the apple Adam bit. Catholics don't know the half of it
Immaculate magic tricks. experimenting with alliteration and assonance
But speaking too many cold words chapped my lips
There's an asterisk up on my left arm
But my foot notes are out of tune from my music always getting stepped on
Should've kept calm when I was granted the chance
But that's my song getting me amped, so god dammit let's dance
Dammit, bring this stuff to fisticuffs if that's the only thing that'll help
Someone like you feel good about yourself and the things your dealt
I'll win the belt but if you need to keep your pants on...
Here another battle for you to talk about in your damn song
Here another battle for you to talk about, wow, look at that...
Another...battle...rap

You won't have to duck, i'll just talk over your head
Knowing your dead career has one year left
Til everyone else knows what I said
They're laughing at you but you don't know it yet
I'd say it to your face but I don't want to waste the moment. Let...
Everyone first understand the open threats that poets get
Who's wet behind the ears? who broke a sweat?
Jiggy man - sip your moet
Thuggy dun- hold your tek
Netcee - go on the net and keystyle '
Bout how we gets no respect
