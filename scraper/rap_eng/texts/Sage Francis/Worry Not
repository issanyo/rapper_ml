[Hook]
Worry not, keep your stress in check
Anxiety's a disease, you gotta learn to live with it
Cancer spreads, it'll eat right through
There oughta be a quarantine for people like you
[Verse I]
I keep clenching my jaw while I sleep
I ain't got no dental insurance, so I purchased a mouth piece
It helps me collect all my teeth, cause they keep falling out in my dreams
Repeating each step till I'm knee deep in sweat
Till you need deeper sleep between sheets who need sex
If you need to eat meat then just feed on the flesh
If your will power's weak seekin' ye shall find death
It'll rent it'll lease it'll own you
You can't teach new tricks to no old fool
I've been banned from the bible
But I stand on my own two
Running from something my legs have no clue
Burning through every last nerve that I got
This condition is more than deserved but I'm not
Killing the time I'm ringing it's neck
Choking it out and I'm stealing its breath
Sucking it in and then blowing a kiss
To the caution I tossed to the wind like this

[Hook]

[Verse II]
Oh you're scared of the dark? then sleep in the light
You came for the bark but then leave when I bite?
Breaking a sweat
Your faint and awake wit a fang in your neck
And a pain in your chest
Losing your power your drained and your wet
When you threw in the towel I caught it like rent
That was well played, you ain't self made
You went from daycare to preschool from K through 12th grade
And that's hard wiring in your brain
Not to mention the rules of the house where you stayed
Synagogue mosque or the church where you prayed
As a child tamed like your wild!
Reprogram, deprogram
There ain't nothing they say we don't know man
They been preying on vulnerable people
And claiming that everything in us is evil
I see them in hell then - but until then
You should chill friend (Just chill!)
Play pretend with the forces of organized
Superstition and get played in the end
We were killing the time I was ringing it's neck
Choking it out and then stealing its breath
Sucking it in and then blowing a kiss
To the caution I tossed to the wind like this

[Hook]
