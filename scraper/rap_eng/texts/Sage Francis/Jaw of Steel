Everybody want Kevin but nobody want fed
I played cemetaries, been heckled by the dead
But Jeckel never Hyde. Every rhyme that I said
Was part man, part wolf. Fight. Never fled

Tighten up the rents on little leather boots
The type to make advances but then never recruits
Loosing to the man while the independent groups
Got a bullet proof plan: "don't meddle with the suits"

My peddle got the loops. My chamber got the echo
Invensted way too much in this here anger to let go
My vicious cycle is a calm steady tempo
I always extinguish birthday candles with a death blow

Dim mark. Hand touch of the faithful
Secrets never leak. Keep the Mescalito playful
Devil on my shoulder saying "I don't need no angel"
Other shoulder's cold silence hanging from a halo

It's the Jaw of Steel

Swing low sweet chariot of fire
Let me know if you need any help carrying it higher
Had it up to here with this valley of desire
Being fearful of a god, and married to a liar

Now daddy's tired of the war that he feels
Mommy's defenseless with a cross on her shield
The golden glove champ born in a field
Backed into a corner, it's the Jaw of Steel

Rewind, Selector. Run that tape backwards
Reverse the curse and become radioactive
It takes practice just excaping these straight jackets
In a land full of snakes without no Saint Patricks

My Irish temper is a curse that is a blessing
A sign that I'm alive although at first it gets upsetting
A burst of addrenaline that then turns to depression...
And I only go to church for a funeral or wedding

Sometimes I can't tell one from the other
The type of place where you could loose a best friend or a lover
A bunch of people crying, keepin stuff under the cover
Confess all your sins, mother fucker

Come down, Selector. Boom! Bye bye to the emperor
Would you die? Die for his leather?
Rely on the weather. They manipulate it with machines
Parade around naked til you freeze

Tornado chase her. Drink with your rival
Listen to the wind get caught in the spin cycle
Worship the idol American psycho
Portrait of a boxer trading in his golden gloves for a rifle
