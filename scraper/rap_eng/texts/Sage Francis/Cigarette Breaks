A room full of happy sot
Come see what daddy got
Players on the sideline
Screaming out "That ain't hot!"
Drama, what got you the answers in the first place
Pants held tight with a shoelace
Keep life in a suitcase
Handle broken off
Dick stay soft and a brand new smoker's cough
Over and over, dodge that boulder
The best type of baby powder pimp man soldier
Wake up from sleep, climb down from my treehouse
Get into your lawn and pull the weeds out
If it ain't been fixed I ain't gon' break it
But hot damn, woman, you look good naked
(Take it) off the record, I got them records
I'm not impressed
I want my fucking hasenpfeffer and my Dr. Pepper
Doctor, doctor

What's the deal, dunny?
You got some real problems?
Show me some real money

I like my black girls clean and my white girls dirty
Doesn't matter, either way they're all out to hurt me
So what's the deal, girl, can I talk to you?
Cause I got a head full of voices telling me that that's what I ought to do
(Why don't you give that girl shit a little bit of a break?)
I do, twenty times a day - I call 'em cigarette breaks
But my heart, my head and my balls ache
From trying to pile on the weight to see how much she can take

[Sage Francis]
Mama never told me all they wanted was a daddy
Baby I could look just like him, maybe even act exactly
How he did. Uninterested, out of touch with what your mama needs
Hard to get through to, hard to please
Hard at work avoiding the family, talking to his secretary's tits
Measure the distance of pleasure mixed with business trips
As usual eyes wander, unscrupulous minds ponder
Possible outcomes over time('s on our side)
Some stop to smell flowers but they're toxic
I don't punch clocks, I knock 'em out the box, Rick (knock 'em out, Rick)
Then some jock until I start the moshpit
Ladies' night at CBGB's hitting on punk rock chicks
Like blaow, how you like me now?
Inscribe my digits in my steel toe so you don't have to write 'em down
Embed it in your head to help you remember, it might help
Slight swells on your back from the cracks of a spiked belt
Trendy poser, she ain't mad at me
"Bend me over, spank me, daddy"
Disciplinary measures existing in every treasure
That's why I keep digging (digging, digging, digging)

[Slug]
You better kill me now before I turn around and blow up right in your face (4x)
