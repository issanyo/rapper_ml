[Intro]
Sometimes a girl
(I want you to be happy)
Will come and go
(And that's like really what it comes down to)
Sometimes a girl
(But as one of my good friends in this world)
Will come and go
(And I hope that whatever happens, that)
Sometimes a girl
(You will be like, real happy)
Will come and go
(Not sort of fake, like that kind of happy)

[Sage Francis]
Maze broken, she's running, feet swollen, he's coming, cheese stolen
And before he even knows it she's gone
Tea cups sitting on the hollow tree stumps
He's dumped and can't seem to swallow these lumps; the beat goes on
Same fire, new passion, old flame: trade it in for a summer fling
It's nothing like that sweet old song
Tip over, root the trees, bend the leaves
Blend in with the open wound; the freeze frames keep him warm
The day's frost is scraped off; the weight loss
The new sign that says "keep off" as he speeds off into the storm
Out of spite the lighting strikes him twice
He's peeking out on the pike and cheating life, peeling out on the lawn
Now he's idling; his time is dwindling
In his mind he's figuring out life's about the little things
And his labyrinth in all its magnificence can only keep the mice trapped
The princess is innocent; she doesn't belong

I never thought I'd miss you
They had a ceremony where he put her in a bridle, the headstall
She stopped to think for a minute, and in a split second went AWOL
I never thought I'd miss you
He draws in the chin as in a expression of resentment or scorn
He's pulling on the reins, the bridle, the shower, the storm
The maze, the high tower, clouds are at war
The reins, the bridle, the shower, the storm
The maze, high tower, clouds are at war
The reins, the bridle, the shower, the storm
The maze, the high tower, clouds are at war
Clouds are at war, the clouds are at war

I never thought I'd miss you [3x]
