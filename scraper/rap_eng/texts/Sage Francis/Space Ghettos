(Mic check)
(Microphone checker!)
(Conceptual rhyme wrecker!)
(Perpetual line stepper!)
(In Ibeca!)

There’s no supply for your demand better try better
Try harder (Permission walk into Tribeca)
Their turnin’
You gotta pray to your mind Mecca
(Never waste energy I’m a valuable time collector)
My agenda will set off a nine-decker
When the die was cast (Hit the brass)
Left the cast (The director)
Write a letter of recommendation to the future generation let em know that you’re comin’
(And they should stay patient)
Never rush greatness (It blossoms slowly)
How could you possibly feel lost and lonely?
You’re takin’ through (No, that’s a rock)
No that’s country blues in jukebox (Naw, that’s graffiti)
Nah, that’s a painting (No, that’s an eco-phenomenon the wall is wailing)
Natural laws are breaking (No, that’s a B-boy routine)
Nah, that’s a space ghetto in Aberdeen

(Proceed ahead to the preferred destination
With the will and determination and desert vegetation
We inhabited dilapidated house of holla holograms)
The apostates loss 50,000 dollar scams
(They called us invalids)
We called in a favor to the department of gravity in inverted pyramids
(A topsy-turvy industry won’t spin me)
I’d make a radio clean getaway but hey…
(It’s a blessing)
It’s a curse
(It’s a wedding)
It’s a hearse
(It’s the hate for hospitals)
It’s the bedding of a nurse
(It’s the setting of a standard happy ending hospice)
Landing on this rock making motherless, godless
Joblessness is a choice more than we care to admit ‘cause most jobs are SHIT
*door knock*
(Who is it?)
It’s the school of fishes
Paying you a visit with their cruel indifference
Ready to do business the cruel and vicious
Far as I’m concerned you got two decisions
Take it to the land and find shelter in some safe meadows
Or make an escape plan to the space ghettos

(Digital minded, you’ve been blinded)
Lookin’ for a star online and when you find em
Goin’ viral cause of a sidenote
(Like everything’s an inside joke for the white folks)
Some of us are laughing but not to the bank
Set your so-called social experiment (Another cheap prank)
You can be apart (But you’re a part)
Believin’ your remarks and territory’s reserved for the pure of heart
(If you don’t earn or deserve the spot)
You should learn to appreciate dissent or desert the lot
(It’s not a riddle) It’s not a maze
(And you don’t need a legend to find your way)

Sometime’s art…is just art for art’s sake
It’s not a safe space to crack, it’s not a lock to break
But when it is
And you’re lost for a reason
Don’t expect the warden just to hand out the key
You can steal things when you exit through the gift shop
That’s where the property owner sings
So blame it on messages to sell novelty decoder rings
That’s graffiti (No, that’s a painting)
Nah, that’s an ecological phenomenon, the ball is wailing
(Natural laws are breaking) Nah, that’s a B-girl
(Bullshit, that’s the oldest space ghetto in the world)

The scientific emcees died a nasty death
Don’t be the last space man gasping for breath
The scientific emcees died a nasty death
Don’t be the last space man gasping for breath
