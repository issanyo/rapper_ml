Bang, bang, boogie
Up jumps the party

I know your name, and the hours that you operate are grave yard
Shift my body weight out the gates
He came, huh, like a thief in the night
This hell hounded off his leash, teeth clenched tight
You might know my face, not the expression that it's left in
When I taste a loved ones blood, my forked tongue
Make sure protect your next of kin
Take it like pain killers
Spill the pills of medicine right down the drain
Flush the evidence then claim your innocence
This shit just isn't their game
In fact, their rules don't apply here
It's a shame that you're going to die here
Underneath my thumb print
All over some dumb shit
Run quick cause you're about to get your punk ass beat in public
Like bang, bang, boogie

He beat down her door with an alibi full of childhood
I killed time while it stood still for her
Moments must have adjusted accordingly, but on his watch
The minutes were fast, giving him whiplash
Beat by the hands of my clock
Lots can happen in an hour
For some days don't fly by, they make a crash landing
I flee by night and only return for emergencies
Just so I can listen to the ambulance sing
Sirens rang, the colors of the flashing lights
Painted the town red in the blackest of nights
So i will not taint beauty in the ugliest of moments
Its that strange side of a poet
I'm writing you out of my will to live and let live
And to give you some perspective, I'm a changed man in that respect
You best get professional detectives and motion detectors to protect your relatives
That's as much warning as your ass will get
I hold my aim, this is an invite to my domain
Pick me up while I hitchhike on memory lane
Sit tight while I back seat drive you insane
And beat your brains until you see nothing but pitch white
And keep you breathing just long enough to have you explain what its like
And how you like it. Convince me

I want to believe
I want to believe that you bleed
I want to believe that you're bleeding
Just as much as she did
I'll experiment with your life until I find it's fucking meaning
You will hang, hang
Bang, bang, boogie

She beat back her attackers with a childhood full of alibis
As I understood, she had to lie
The battle cries must have adjusted accordingly
Her stopped calls for help never were answered back
And for that beat by the hands of my clock
Lots can happen in a matter of seconds
Ask for a repentance from a looking glass
Self shattered reflections
Before you blame your anger on adolescence
Listen to the symphony of ambulances sing

So beautiful
So nice
Tell me where were you last night?
As usual
You lied
Tell me where the fuck you hide

It goes bang, bang, boogie
Up jumps the party
I always notice when she has new marks on her body
