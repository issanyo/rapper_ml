Call me Xaul Zan, a person cursed to remain faceless
In a small van with curtains and it's her fame that makes this
Even more grand it's all planned, the worst shame is i'm paceless
Her doorman and I are on a first name basis

I kick the worst game in cases that are up close and personal
I'm the utmost personable person who won't converse when I don't have my curtains pulled
At least that's how I picture it
