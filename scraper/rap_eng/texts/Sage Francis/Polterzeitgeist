[Intro]
While you're going around trying to keep people outta hell
I'm going around trying to keep hell out of people

[Verse I]
Your evil sends chills through my bones and it flows through the back roads of my arteries
Genetic memory fights technology administered by moral midgets
There are picket signs in my eyes and when they strike you'll wanna talk business
Note to self, go for self, go for broke no one else ever showed you the ropes or helped
And what are they supposed to do?
Of course they gotta rebuild every wall that you broke on through
Drugs won't get my thoughts runnin'
I need em to make these thoughts stop comin'
Last night I had a dream I shot someone
When I awoke my hands were full of the fluid my heart's pumpin
I went to get it tested, the doctor was not so interested in analyzing the message
He had a pill, that if he issues out, he gets paid on the side
I got a lifetime supply

[Hook]
Maybe he's a ghost, and maybe I'm the host
The polterzeitgeist who know the right price to pay the priest to release me from these ropes
Maybe I'm the ghost, and maybe he's the host
The polterzeitgeist who knows the right price to pay the priest to release me from these ropes

[Verse II]
I fell into a Venus fly trap with a nicotine eye patch
Pirate of the ship sippin' Listerine nightcaps
Disguised her voice with the breath of a clean slate
Awake every morning to the death of my dream date
Selling sex to cheapskates with rusty blades
Fuck to forget and call it lay away
Got an addiction to thin ice
The whisper of wind pipes
I'm master insight
This social costume is skin tight
Nah, I don't believe in you
And you don't believe that I'm leaving you
As you shrink away to nothing in my rear view
Too close to call Too far to be hearing you
Singing my meoldy, I heard it subconsciously
When you spoke in your sleep it sounded like honesty
When you awoke you said it was not for me
I said "Oh I know obviously"
You're not my Yoko so I cropped the photo and I rocked it solo
Now you gotsta go, GO!

[Hook]

[Verse III]
Maybe you're a ghost and I'm the conduit
The common thread in every superficial compliment
The loose string in your moral fabric
Hole in your logic
Hopelessly romantic in Woonsocket
Leaving notes for the next to come
Written in blood from the wound that they'll exit from
I don't compose prose or sonnets
I just write like my life depends on it
Front like I'm agnostic
But I don't believe in you
You've got a transparent nature that I'm seeing through
Somebody spiked the punch that you beat me to
Sometimes I'm not even sure it's even you

[Outro]
Maybe you're a ghost, and maybe I'm the host
The polterzeitgeist who know the right price to pay the priest to release me from these ropes
