I've been patient
I've been a mental patient
I've been a parental replacement
For kids sent to the basement
I'm a has-been. I've been had
I've become best friends with a pen and pad
Understanding the logic of an inanimate object
Standing in the projects with a sign around my neck
Saying "Show me my respect!"
They thought it as a setup, upset
I've been unusual
I've been an unusual suspect
You're beautiful, just check
To make sure that you're musical on set
I'll be back in a minute
React to the limit
And find out if ya act offended
Asking me if you can kick it?
I said "No you may not."
Cause your flow just ain't hot
So you busters stay shy
What the fuck do they got?
Watch your mouth. What'd that bitch say?
That went way out
No doubt hit by the ricochet
Kids today. I just don't trust em
When I have mine I'm a make him speak in rhymes
He'll think that it's custom
I'll tell him that he's Muslim every Christmas
So on December 25th he'll be giftless
Then I'll convince this dumbass
He's actually a witness of Jehovah
Flip mat sheets on the sofa
Have him bring fat chicks on over
Give em drinks if they're sober
We'll make some noise soon
If she stinks up an odor
Send it to my boys room
This is my house
You don't like it you can get the fuck out
Cause under my roof, you live by my rules, son
I make you want to bounce

Sage Francis makes you wanna bounce
Joey Beats makes you wanna bounce
Non-Prophets weathered and deep cuts
We send battle rhymes to shatter minds
The Secret Service Crew
But they'll all fall through
Non-Prophets
If you're jumping up and down right now
Stop it

I've made a man mad
I've been a mad man
I've been a goody two shoes
Who walks bare footed in a bad land
I've been to Madison
"What's up?" to my Boston heads
I came to visit y'all
But you know me I got lost instead
I toss in bed
Keep myself awake at night
Worried that I might not fall asleep
Until I see the light
My friends wanna see me fight
Cause I'm a Black Belt Karate Master!
I'd rather have my freestyle raps
Sale the party's laughter
Plus I'm out of shape
And haven't trained in months
Can't count how many times
My face has been punched
I'm feeling cranial lumps
They made you a chump
I left you walkin a course of
Mind anguish with sign language
Is y'all def or what?
That depends. You mean the d-e-a-f kind?
He must've read my lips so hard
That he was left blind
I've never been signed
But I've been signed off
Cause I never rhyme soft
Or wore designed cloth
Every time I cough
I swear to God that it's a cardiac arrest
Feel my chest
Make sure it's not a heart attack
I'm stressed
It's rest that I probably lack
Yes. I'm a full fledged
Over the edge hypochondriac obsessed
With cleaning the rims on my Pontiac
Rollin through the plaza asking
"where tha party at?"
Come in hardly last
But hardly fat
Buying oil in Iraq
To get him violent
And his car keys back
My wife don't want me back
I want to hold her
It's a shame she ain't been the same
Ever since I told her
"This is my house
You don't like it, you can get the fuck out
This is my roof, you live by my rules bitch."
She said I had to bounce

Sage Francis makes you wanna bounce
Joey Beats makes you wanna bounce
Non-Prophets weathered and deep cuts
We send battle rhymes to shatter minds
The Secret Service Crew
But them all fall through
Non-Prophets
If you're jumping up and down right now
