[Intro]
You gotta love the lie
You gotta love the lie

[Hook]
Love (love) life (life)
Love (love) God, girls and lies
I can't hear through those veneers
But you keep speaking with those pearly whites

[Verse I]
Love the life that you live if it gives love back
You ain't gotta stay together for the kids
If you want to disappear don't announce it
Vanish in thin air and bounce quick
Fix the cowlick slick your hair back
Ride the rim bare back you stared at
Lady Godiva might have been an exhibitionist
I'm not here to judge voyeuristic fetishes
If nobody looked its a closed book
You could put your hang ups on a coat hook
I'm from a puritanical land where they burn witches
I'm the result of a welfare running up your sickness
Cure never came Jesus never helped
We were all to blame god beat us with a belt
If I heard your name I'd retreat into myself
I won't hurt your name I'll keep it to myself with

[Hook]

[Verse II]
No legacy to claim no enemies to squelch
No chemical imbalance that could remedy yourself
Pedestals for the parents medicine is on the shelf
Put the trophy in the spotlight watch as it melts
Metal would've survive plastic is cheaper
Ran into the fire she asked me to leave her
I did what I could with the wood and the flammables
Stood with the good little animals ran with the bulls
Soot on my hands that were full put the good book on the mantle
Burn baby burn you could serve as a candle
Last thing I heard was her on the piano
Last thing I saw was her being her self
By beating her self to see if it could help
If I heard your name I'd retreat into myself
I won't hurt your name I'll keep it to myself with

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Love the lie [x3]

[Verse III]

The cure never came Jesus never helped
We were all to blame God beat us with a belt
If I heard your name I'd retreat into myself
I won't hurt your name I'll keep it to myself
No legacy to claim no enemies to squelch
No chemical imbalance that could remedy itself
Pedestals for the parents medicine is on the shelf
Put the trophy in the spotlight watch as it melts with love

[Outro]
Love the lie [x6]
