(We're back up and running. We're completely untouchable.)

(Yo, I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids
I won't sit back and rap like these dumb ass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids
I won't sit back and rap like these dumb ass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids
I won't sit back and rap like these dumb ass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids
I won't sit back and rap like these dumb ass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids
I won't sit back and rap like these dumb ass kids)

Diligent vigilantes, vigilant digital banshee
In the Silicon Valley of Death, tickling your Biblical fancy
In the middle of political, literal, and lyrical miracle of Conservative-leaning liberals:
(With a pimp-strut)
Sneaking adult beverages in your sippy cup
That's a parental-advisory hitch in this sexy bitch's giddy-up
You can't shame the dullest tool in the shed for being blunt
'Cause (What!?) we're not all made to cut (Ohh!), if I may be so curt
If I'm allowed to be frank, no one understood my words 'til I was breaking the bank
'Cause I was drawing the crowds, while they was drawing the blank
They was trying to hold me around, while I was pulling their rank
I wasn't so full of myself I wouldn't make time for play
But baby I'm a tank, time to get outta my way
You can praise a broken clock for being right twice a day
But you can't fix stupid with late fees, my G
(There's a price to pay)

(Sit back and rap like these dumb ass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids
I won't sit back and rap like these dumb ass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids
I won't sit back and rap like these dumb ass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids
I won't  sit back and rap like these dumb ass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids)

If you see my inner child... give him dap
We paying these bills with rap, lil' homie, how ill is that?
Good prediction back when composition pads
Had us skipping class, (just a dumb ass kid)
With some dubbed tapes and a wiffle bat
When the last time you heard a soundboy burial?!
Epic, Beard, Men, come through in stereo
These rappers invented fake news, paying for views
My advice to young writers is quit. (Stay in school)
But if that ain't you, then nothing I can say or do will change the truth:
Take your own advice, ignore the hype, and don't be chasing youth
Start out spending on them charms, end up rapping off your phone
We heard the DJ drop the (bomb) but you weren't in the zone
I don't pay no dues to the pyramid scheme, ain't no use not a hit with the Tweens
Strange old dude but he spit real clean, and embrace whole crews with a quick sixteen
See, you're at the prom to go home with the queen
I'm with the woman she's hoping to be
No disrespect to the kids, tell 'em it's lit
The grown-ups will know what I mean

(Sit back and rap like these dumb ass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids
I won't sit back and rap like these dumb ass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids
I won't sit back and rap like these dumb ass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids
I won't  sit back and rap like these dumb ass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids)

(Epic Beard Men motherfucker! God damn!)
(Stop right there! God damn!)
*scratches*
(Watch your mouth!)
*scratches*
(Who the fuck told you, you could rap?)
(Get a job!)
(Doing dumb shit!)
*scratches*
(Bang, bang, shot's fired
But you're scared to say my name)
