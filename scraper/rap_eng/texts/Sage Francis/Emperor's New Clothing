I listen for secrets hidden in whispers
And in the winter time I catch them tickling my whiskers
Colliding with wind chimes
The type that send shivers up and down tingling spines
Thinking time could stretch if
We'd spin a design inside our web that would catch drifts
The type that blow out birthday candles before we make our death wish
I'm waiting for a message in my calling; I'm checking my voicemail
And I'm answering machines with man made dreams
Man made band-aids cover up the seams and the cover-up seems
To only work if the wound never opens up or bleeds
Beads of sweat form above the eyes of a heathen Emperor
Who won't get on his feet and step outside into the freezing temperature
He wants to adjust the global thermostat
But he's so remote; you can't control the world like that
Come to find these eggs ain't even golden
I see depreciation in the family jewels the Queen is holding
That marriage was fixed; it happened when her feet were frozen
She still remains to be the only one who's seen the Emperor's new clothing...
