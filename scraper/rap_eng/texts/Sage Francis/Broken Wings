(Chorus)
She's a fairy with broken wings
I used to watch her perform
And if she hears me I hope she sings songs
That had me going right back
Couldn't find anyone in town to talk
Bout how no one like that
Should be confined to the ground we walk

She glides but just seems like she floats
And these folks decide to crush her wings until they're permanently broke
She rides gusts of wind just by the way she spoke
She cries but loves to sing songs of freedom and hope
On the eastside hustling, discussing things that we quote
In shallow conversation as if we have deep throats
We chokin' on confusion
Now show up as a heat stroke of we need coats
Trading in our cheap jokes for her c notes
I see notes being passed
I ask to see what these creeps wrote
Define silly kids and flying privileges revoked
Ski slopes have been blocked off they can't transit
Had weights tied to her ankles she most definitely can't skip
Town, shes held down by the transcripts my hands grip
Tried to tie her wings back on before they're once again clipped
Panic stricken, she'll remain stuck
On a Titantic sinkin', shes trying to stay up
Change her plan thinkin' it's OK
See this is strange but
Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves in a way that kept them chained up
I'd like to see
Her take flight into the stars
Instead of letting her fly free they keep her in jars
Instead of letting fly free they keep 'em in jars
I put my hand to the glass so hard
It might break the prison bars
It isn't hard to see why they keep her captive
She's naturally attractive
Speaks with adlibs, shes uncommonly talented
Ain't enough adjectives to do her disposition justice
Kids are wishin' for just a kiss and it's a mission to touch her lipstick
Can't trust her with
Freedom of movement that's a chance to loose her quick
If she ups and splits
We might as well call that discussion quits
If we's to keep her down the government's underlings
Enslave people in this town especially if their culture's rich
Exploiting talents making it do a bunch of tricks
With the rest of the wingless imports
Repeatedly told you ain't a fairy just a bitch
Just a bitch, with a butt that's thick
So rub your tits, and thrust your hips
And suck my dick, and run your shit, and run your shit, and run your shit

(Chorus)
Shes a fairy with broken wings
I used to go watch her perform
And if she hears me I hope she sings songs
That had me going right back
Couldn't find anyone in town to talk
Bout how no one like that
Should be confined to the ground

(Verse Two)
When I was down in New York she'd send me letters
And I read her passages about how I left her to the savages
No matter how sad it is I didn't cry
Cause it was only a matter of time
Before they figured me out and tried to strip my pride
I knew the scoop
Wish you could've seen the blueprints in my eye
When I flew the coop
Utilizing overground railroads in the sky
It was live or die let me let you in on the secret of mine
Me and you are different girl
We don't even need wings to fly

We don't need wings to fly
Me and you... we don't need wings to fly
Keep on singing, give it a try, give it a try
Just keep on singing, give it a try, give it a try (5x)
