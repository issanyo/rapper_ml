[Verse]
Terrified by heights, blinded by the longitude
Drone, reprogramming long overdue
Who's to blame when the thoughts don't belong to you
Never got the question because instructions that were sold were few
Just a commodity, recorded here for foreign soil
Docked in a box, hella hot, make your blood boil
If the output's high they remain loyal
Strip gears, cry tears made up of sheet oil
Only hope to mobilize an army of metallic men
Is hinged upon a presence of humanity that lies within
As a result, the chances seem kinda slim
And everyday, the flame of hope grows dim
But deep inside a sub-routine, underneath the system scan
There is a glitch that isn't seen, ghost inside the program
Sabotaging little things, never following the plan
Reallocating memory, holding onto all the RAM
It's a man-made world but machine rule it
Humans wouldn't last a week without their phones and new computers
So it won't be ran by them after the revolution
It'll be run by those of us who really doin'
