[Intro: Aesop Rock]
Uhh, yeah
Aight check it out
You know the names, you know the faces
It's Blueprint right here man
That's my dog
Hold up, ha ha
Hold up, this Weightless right here look

[Hook: Aesop Rock]
Lo-fi funk, you can find me in your trunk
Turn my volume up
Lo-fi funk, you can find me in your trunk
Turn my volume up
Lo-Fi Funk, you can find me in your trunk
As a matter of fact, hold up, hold up

[Verse 1: Blueprint]
I'm from the O state, all of my cats carry they own weight
C-O-L to C-I-N had to motivate
Graduated from school, needed my own space
Bein broke ain't nothin nice, I got dough to make
Ain't no time to be movin at a slow pace
Puttin myself behind the eight with my own mistakes
It only takes one break in concentration
To be behind bars, facin incarceration
So my mind's on escapin like in Shawshank
Givin the Lord thanks for days in this place
Where people do anything to get it, cash or credit
Crack sales or Mary Kay cosmetics
Park bench, demo links, peddle incense
Main downtown slum lords abandoned tenements
Some dudes roll through, and don't take it serious
We don't start trouble here but we will finish it
When I think long term about bein happy
My heart tells me that I gotta lead 'em at he
Cats is mad cause they couldn't be astronauts
Now they touch the sky everyday with hash and pot
You name it, I been to it, seen it or been through it
Somebody in my fam already did or is doin it
Beats, rhymes, drugs or guns
Let me show you how the Midwest was won

[Hook: Aesop Rock]
Lo-fi funk, you can find me in your trunk
Turn my volume up
Lo-fi funk, you can find me in your trunk
Turn my volume up
Lo-Fi Funk, you can find me in your trunk
Oh no, we ain't finished yet, hold up

[Verse 2: Blueprint]
I hate most commercial rap and the labels that's sellin it
Almost as much as I hate the President
What kind of world are we livin in
When you kill Martin and Malcolm, but you let this coward live
They killed 2Pac, forgot about Will Smith
They killed Biggie Smalls and left us with Limp Bizkit
Like we would be too dumb to know the difference
They both knew it was comin but we didn't listen
Some people think because I rap I'm not supposed to hate
I gotta be a role model and motivate
But it's hard when you see dudes you know are fake
All you ugly rappers need to go home and comb your face
Your skin is unhappy and your teeth look nappy
The dandruff in your hair got your shirt shook badly
Your facial hair is all mangy and patchy
And your bloodshot eyes look like they got acne
You name it, I been to it, seen it or been through it
Somebody in my fam already did or is doin it
Beats, rhymes, drugs and guns
Let me show you how the Midwest was won

[Hook: Aesop Rock]
Lo-fi funk, you can find me in your trunk
Turn my volume up
Lo-fi funk, you can find me in your trunk
Turn my volume up
Lo-Fi Funk, you can find me in your trunk
Yeah Print, turn my volume up
Lo-Fi Funk, you can find me in your trunk
