[Verse 1: Aesop Rock]
Yo, I mock tenor, lend a hand (Lend that hand!)
We rock negative, mock to lend a hand to zealots
I walk the block with a can of phantom repellant
A cappella got a bread crumb; spray the crowd
Fill that gut up to that stomach, shut the fuck up!

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
Let’s make a sharp turn to avoid this road of heartburn
Those that are smart learn
To carefully count the amount they art earns
Barefoot we walk on a dirt trail full of broken glass
I’m prepared to say (I’ma be alright)
Secretly hope you ask

[Verse 3: Slug]
Dismantling the math of every bridge in our path
The ugly carving out a line between the good and the bad
You can scream until the cords in your neck stretch and snap
But best believe the three of us
Will walk away with the last laugh

[Verse 4: Aesop Rock]
Your stance to the canvas silhouettes
With a crooked cigarette clamp and a raised cup
Crooked in the cage for luck; if I should botch it
Negotiate the merger with an optimistic process
Then serve through the wormhole
I guess I’m still learning the trickery
Breathe and I shove my key in the mystery
Jimmy the latch and attach my nickname to the victory
It’s like, we’ve been through the same shit a hundred times
If you see a penny, pick it up, like engine number nine

[Verse 5: Eyedea]
Time is of the essence
The blind will get offended
My prime is with my presence
Mine gets all the credit
Rewind that for a second
That line wasn’t impressive
Find what I’ve suggested
(And dine on what we’ve shedded)
From the negatives and positives
And sedatives deposited
In sediments of consciousness
The let-it-live hypothesis
Of rhetoric took hostages
To shed up with the goddesses
My head is splittin’, gotta get
Some medicine to conquer it

[Verse 6: Slug]
Yo, this town is nothing but a ghost town
The tumbleweeds are whispering
To get down with the broke down
And these days I spend more time on the freeways
Than I do in my own bed, and it’s fucking up my head
Another pack of smokes, roughly seven more beers
Brings me another day closer to the end of this year
This farm caught all the damage the storm brought
We're taking all of your crops
From your children to your corncobs

[Verse 7: Aesop Rock]
Okay, my attempt's to break the ice
I take a slice at pacifism
Classically conditioned to be a Pavlov
To stick in the kitchen while the bell tolls
Placed in a cell amidst fellow hermits
Note a thousand hello’s
But not enough room for two thousand elbows

[Verse 8: Eyedea]
I’ve got a chip on my shoulder and a chip in my tooth
The proof is in the pudding, but the pudding’s in my youth
The kid growing older through a stick in the truth
Tryin’ to rip himself loose from the grip of the noose

[Verse 9: Slug]
Man, how many minutes must I sit in this corner and fidget?
Patiently searching for existence in this KFC biscuit
Eyedea, Blockhead, Atmosphere, Aesop Rock (What?)
Who the fuck you think left them cracks in your sidewalk?

[Verse 10: Aesop Rock]
Eyedea could spit death and Slug could spit in your modem
I could spit rap and attach the liberty bell makeover
It’s bound to be nothing short of scrapped delineation
But I gave this song a raise, she considers herself taken
So I stick to where the winds burn faces
Sometimes flash yellow backs like jaundice patients
Complacent with stop-drop runaway
If there's art in casualty
Maybe the fact my plastic halo runs off of car batteries
Like fishin’ through art galleries

[Verse 11: Eyedea]
I’ve been waiting for this situation for the past few days
Masturbating with my thoughts
While caught in the masquerade
I’m beating around the bush looking for a faster way
Perhaps to play on this stage a disaster will actually pay
Maybe, so I keep on going straight
What do you say, "We"?
Could trade places and wait patient to go crazy
I blatantly warned you, fatefully scorned
Vague description of my silhouette
Wouldn't make sense to the mind of a baby

[Verse 12: Slug]
We never looked for trouble from no one (Please be my friend)
But if the shoes fit, I’ll wear them kicks with pride
Inside and outside (All the way to the song’s end)
And maybe we’ll all get along when we die
What we’re trying to say is
You could never begin to comprehend this
No need to even attempt
This planet is mine, and I’ma handle it fine
When I learn how to manage my time (Manage your time)

[Hook: Slug]
I’ma wear down this world with my tracks (With my tracks)
I’ma love it until I break her back (Break that back!)
And I’ma blow her a kiss and a smile (There’s that smile!)
With my luck I’ma miss by a mile (Miss by a mile)
I’ma wear down this world with my tracks (With my tracks)
I’ma love it until I break her back (Break that back!)
I’ma blow her a kiss and a smile (There’s that smile!)
With my luck I’ma miss by a mile (Miss by a mile)

[Outro: Eyedea]
With my luck I’ll probably miss by a mile
With my luck I’ll probably miss by a mile
With my luck I’ll probably miss by a mile
With my luck I’ll probably miss by a mile
