[Verse 2: Rob Sonic]

Jolly roger flags, glass in his gill
Mary wants the captain jacked and dragged to the bilge
Tethered to the weather vain and drained of his fill
Poured into cups, and drank once its chilled
Crazy fucking loon, bugs on his lips
Tugging on his handle bar mustache grips
Steiner full of shells and a belt full of clips
For the first, time he’s left off your list

[Verse 4: Rob Sonic]

Run from the hounds, marking the wall
Mommy tattooed on the arm of the law
Maid milked drilled till the partridge appalled
More game got, cartridge installed
What’s on first? basses are warm
And all of them are mine and their faces deformed
Chin music played on the razors reward
P isn’t free, pay for the porn

[Verse 6: Rob Sonic]
Red alert panic, hands on the deck
Motor mouth body shop canceled your check
East bound and up truck sample sex
Mouth full of miller handful of x
Skim from the top, undercut the take
Clubber lang the banker butter up the other 8
Wait for the beep leave your number and your name
And why it is you called, props or complaints?
