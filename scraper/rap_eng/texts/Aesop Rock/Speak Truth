[Intro]
Yeah, Yeah
San Salvador, El Salvador
Speak truth
You know you gotta speak truth
Don't speak, unless you speaking truth

[Verse 1: Homeboy Sandman]
Speak truth when it's not easy
Speak truth when it's gonna hurt
Speak truth when they gon' look at you strange
Speak truth anyway, speak truth all the same
Speak truth as your favourite past-time
Hey-yo, speak truth even when it's different from last time
Speak truth if it makes people leave
They may not even know it but truth's what they need
If you seek truth, you gotta speak truth
Pretty truth, bleak truth, bitter truth, sweet truth
If you bullshit, then it's see-through
But if you speak truth, you don't need proof
Speak truth any type mood, [?]
Speak truth even when you don't think it's the right move
Speak truth 'stead of cowering, it's empowering. (Ye)

Truuu-uu-uuuthh, truuu-uu-uuuthh, truuu-uu-uuuthh, uuu-uuuutthhhh [x2]

[Verse 2: Homeboy Sandman]
The truth has gotta see the light of day
As soon as you know it, speak truth right away
In this reality it might seem out of place
That's only because this reality's so out of shape
Speak with honesty
I know that it's cliche to say the truth shall set you free, but it will
Speak truth, keep it real
No excuse, speak truth, we can build
If you ain't got nothing nice to say, lots of times it's best to say nothing
But if you gonna say something, speak truth
There's no need to waste time tryna' be cute
If you scared speak truth anyway
Everything gon' work out in some bug crazy way
Or some magic type shit like 'poof'
That's the reason why you always gotta speak truth

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Homeboy Sandman]
When you gotta come clean speak truth
When you get a hard question speak truth
When you think it's gonna make her split speak truth
When they not gon' understand speak truth
There's some people you can't really speak truth to
It's not useful
Speaking truth still goes very far
Speak truth, it will help you find out who they are
(Ye) So you can dead 'em
If you can't speak truth to 'em, forget 'em. (Let 'em go)
Don't wait
If they can't speak truth then they just dead weight
Lame ducks
Speak truth, it's nothing to be ashamed of
Speak truth instead of some shit that's made up
One

[Hook]
