[SYSTEM 605 Sample]
"And you can come
And meet my mother
Any day you like;
System 605, unit 91."

[Aesop]
I forever wallow in glitches
Grimly distributed by side effects
Consumed, cocooned in antisocial trenches — drenched
Cradled between dense pillars of polar value
Lies a grey soul blueless
It's got I fiending for the sky
(Synthesized lies rise synthetic)
Sitting inside solidified plastics
Whose lateral burns germ-compatible
My firm's radically piloted
Dodging a fire swiftly
Yellow-brick stalker walking shifty

I'm but a prototype Metroid programmed to holocaust style
While you're sulking in the stages of denial
Your petty soldiers stand fragile like Giacometti sculptures
Embedded in eremetic cultures we's rocksteady vultures
Plus I's the geyser throwing a soul
My wingspan stands flags in the snow of the poles—
Berzerk!
Swerve my alignment towards solitary confinement and jaded
Stripping, color my passion mitigated
I'm slipping

[Ann Colville]
You always seem like a small grey cat to me
Sleeping underneath the silvery moon
Paws curled beneath your head
'til the sun came 'round just around noon
And you would greet me, purring in your doorway
Drawing at your tail around my hips
And I would go into your mouth wide open
Waiting for my language to come from your lips
And I'll move you
And you like it
Just enough
To let me
How I hate you
Cause you're lonely
And you know how
To forget me

[Aesop]
For the love of my personal practice I reside
Where obstructive fluxes and societal withdrawal collides
Slide fueled by the fury
Spun a ring around my honor
But the opulence took shelter in my parlor
Melancholy masquerade
Cast amongst the braiding of belligerence and
Blazing terror that blew the lock down off my placement
I stay special agent 'til the sky falls
Reverse the curse 'til my fellow Lost Children disperse

[Ann Colville]
And your footsteps leading down the pathway
Never seem to be quite like my own
Your mind and smokey circles
Have blinded me, 'til I turned towards home
And you would watch me falling in the distance
Hands held high above your head
I only leave the territory when there's nothing left
To be said
And I'll move you
And you like it
Just enough
To let me
How I hate you
Cause you're lonely
And you know how
To forget me

"And you can come
And meet my mother..."

[Aesop]
I make music and connect color to canvas
Swoop down from the trees with potpourris of other bandits
Landed randomly upon the valleys of the grimace
Saw my planet lead starts burning from the outside in:
Meaning your clout lies thin
Salt prep the blades prior to fire phase in my ever-changing underworld
Serate a day to decorate a traitor
That sting never fades like belly wounds from sling blades
Follow my portion:
I'm gonna swallow distortion and spit the filter
