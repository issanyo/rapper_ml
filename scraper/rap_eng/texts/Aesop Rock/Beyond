[Lana]
Well she was only 13 but her body was older
And she didn’t know the rules, see nobody had told her
Caught by the wrong guy, easy to hold her
Crazy how many ladies carry that weight like a soldier
Just wait till it’s over, fake it ain’t wrong
And force you to forget it like your head wasn’t on
Beware the effects while you’re pushing it down
Cuz it took 30 fuckin’ years to figure out she ain’t do nothin’ wrong

[Luck]
See nothing wrong with this picture
Picture little doot first sips off the liquor
Forties and the Ciscos night train sipper
Sneaking out the house smoke grass till it get him
Off in search of bigger highs, better highs, better hide the wallet why, Whippets and Mollies plus coke get him tantalized
The addict life on the dragon ride, a man of pride but what's inside?

[Chorus]
As we go, the past remains
But on, Beyond, the magic waits
Keep your faith, make your fate
Together it’s whatever we make
We make the chain, we make the change
And nevermind your yesterdays

[Aesop Rock] One Dark horse, bust thru his barn doors, trying to look tough for bunch of other dartmoors, heart more weak-knee, stomach all squeamish, envied the brolic, although he'd never be it
Get ski'd til he starts to Believe it
And talk that steez to a beacon of G shit, Jeez
Things get Inconvenient, When you actually reap what you sew in the pretense

[Del The Funky Homosapien]  You talk crazy mess, you a psycho patient, all type of statements, zero consideration
Low self-esteem, in the gutter like a ninja turtle, but you know splinter’ll hurt you
If you give him a reason, like a easy pass, free to fly that head cuz of degrees you drag, which leaves a trail
You have a funeral and cover it up, but like treasure someone dug it up

[Chorus]
As we go, the past remains
But on, Beyond, the magic waits
Keep your faith, make your fate
Together it’s whatever we make
We make the chain, we make the change
And nevermind your yesterdays

[Luck]
No regrets, even tats, even less
Leaving stress where it's at bring it back I suggest
You relax, this is therapy, it has electrolytes!
It's what plants crave, it's what the ladies like
Add intelligence, humor relevance
A bit of poetry emotion it's decadent
Won't dumb it down your taste buds are excellent
We making change, you listening that's evidence
[Lana]
Togetherness, forgiveness, heavenly to witness
See it in the heavens or you find it in the scriptures
Doesn’t make a difference, love’ll make the difference
When you see the light you know that livin’ is a privilege
We can laugh at the pain that we take
And you can feel alive in a life you can shape
Every word, every thought, every move that we make
The future is the fruits of what we choose to create

[Chorus]
As we go, the past remains
But on, Beyond, the magic waits
Keep your faith, make your fate
Together it’s whatever we make
We make the chain, we make the change
And nevermind your yesterdays
