[Verse 1]
Same movie, different actress, quite the theatrics
Yell out, “Cut!” when I’m tired of flinging matches
When no explosion happens, passion passes your gut fast
And you wake up with a girl in a Robitussin mustache
I start to feel like a stalker, the curves of her drive by
And my nerves is too shot to talk to her
I don’t know how to convey it or make you see art
With no control of when our souls are gonna depart

[Hook]
I wanna lay in your stain like a dog
And wear your scent like a shitty gold chain
I wanna lay in your vein like blood
And play you out like a shitty gold chain
I wanna stay in your brain because you’re sane
And that’s enough for me to complain
I wanna cave into pain but it’s too late
Just trying to feel good is a strain

I won’t be mean to you, I won’t be seen with you
I have to talk to you, I wanna walk with you
I have no lights here, I wanna fight with you
I wanna be with you

[Verse 2]
I won’t let you go if you hate me, just don’t amputate me
I won’t try to kill myself today as long as you save me
These drugs are for babies, I’ll manipulate you crazy
Just to get you to crave me
Oxygen navigates through the bloody slice to coagulate it
When a young girl in a tub opened her wrist and traded her life
Her makeup was nice, her letter bold and lead
Folded up under a candle, when opened read

[Hook]
I wanna lay in your stain like a dog
And wear your scent like a shitty gold chain
I wanna lay in your vein like blood
And play you out like a shitty gold chain
I wanna stay in your brain because you’re sane
And that’s enough for me to complain
I wanna cave into pain but it’s too late
Just trying to feel good is a strain

I won’t be mean to you, I won’t be seen with you
I have to talk to you, already stalking you
I have no right to you, I wanna fight with you
I wanna be in you

[Verse 3]
DNA make up the break up, make up with takeout
Doggy bags from the steakhouse
True, a bloody nose will ruin the make out session
She breaks out walking on me, can pull the left-over steaks out
My whole life is a blur
Why is it no matter how many faces switch places it’s still her?
I wish I wasn’t attracted but the mind attaches
Snuck in her parents’ house, stole her old mattress

[Hook]
So I can lay in your stain like a dog
And wear your scent like a shitty gold chain
I wanna lay in your vein like blood
And play you out like a shitty gold chain
I wanna stay in your brain because you’re sane
And that’s enough for me to complain
I wanna cave into pain but it’s too late
Just trying to feel good is a strain

I won’t be mean to you, I won’t be seen with you
I have to talk to you, already stalking you
I have no right to you, I wanna fight with you
I wanna be in you
