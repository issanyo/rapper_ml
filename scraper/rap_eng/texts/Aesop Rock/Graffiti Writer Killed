Woke up at moms house around noon
Heard breakfast cooking and television on the news
Head towards the kitchen, eggs and fried pork
"Graffiti Writer Killed" heard words, dropped fork
Whoever killed the kid had a score to settle
Broke his face, cops found him in a bloody puddle
Stole all his clothes, left him the street
Lying dead next to his own half finished piece
No known suspects, but I can guess
Starting with the gas mask he died with around his neck
So violent. I remain silent
And hid the stencil I was working on underneath my desk
Drama if my mommy find it
I'm reminded of the cats I had a fight with last week
Hit some licks, but ain't seen em since
Man I hope they ain't think that kid In the mask was me, shit
The silence in the room starts to taunt me
So i dip into the basement, start some laundry
A kid might've got killed because of me
The possibility of this being my fault haunts me
Need to know more about the crime
So I ask my drone to compile all the information on line
In thirty secs got it all indexed
A two-page report slowly prints to my desk
A good start, but need more focus
A strong cross reference might get me much closer
Drill down to the known sex offenders
Living three miles out from the spot of the murder
The search only came back with ten names, but five of those got eliminate quick because of age
One female, crossed her out
About to see what these other four talking about
