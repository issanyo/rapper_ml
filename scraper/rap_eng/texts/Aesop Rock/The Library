[Verse 1: Kimya]
Where better to go with a two-year-old who gets cabin fever when it's raining cold?
Or you could just chill out, no whistles and bells, and read everything by hand with books and wells
We could color with crayons, we could put together puzzles
We could read about triumphs, we could read about struggles
You could be a wizard, I could be a muggle
We could sit in the rocking chair and snuggle

[Hook: Kimya]
The library, the library
Is the perfect place for me
The library, the library
You can hang out all day and it doesn't cost a penny!
The library, the library
Is the perfect place for me
The library, the library
It's such a big part of our community

[Verse 2: ]
You could check your email
You could check out books
You could take things home
Or just sit and look
At magazines, computer screens
There's books on tape, there's DVDs!
There's people there who are ready
To help you find the things you need!
There's fiction, non-fiction, and new releases!
My heart broke into a million little pieces
When I walked in that day and saw the sign that said
You'd be closed for a really, really long time
Desk was made into a makeshift shrine
Checked out all your artwork and I added mine!

[Hook: Kimya]
The library, the library

[Verse 3: Kimya]
The grass was heavy! with dewey decimals
When I woke up that morning my fingers trembled
As I reheated my coffee in the microfish, waved goodbye to you
Now here's a greeting card for your catalog
As we start these few chapters of your autobiography
Two months without you was two months too long
We're so happy you're back we wrote you this song!

[Verse 4: Aesop Rock
Excuse me, hi, this library's groovy
And I always like the book version better than the movie!
But I need a little help 'cuz I'm totally a noobie!
Where can I find all the Bloom comma Judy?

[Spoken, play?]
Hey where are all the Judy Bloom books, anyway?
Well, some of her books are in the juvenile section (uh-huh) and some of them are in the young-adult section (okay), and some are even in the adult section! (wow!) All of the fiction books are arranged alphabetically by the author's last name. (oh..) Are you really looking for books just by Judy Bloom, or..are there any particular..[interrupted]
I guess I'd be open for suggestions
Sarah do you have any suggestions?
Well Kelsey, there's Norma Klein or Carolyn Kuni, (okay)
Oh, Sarah Jessin! (ooh) Jerry Spinelli (yes) Cecil Castoluci (okay), Don't forget John Green! (okay, I'm writing this..) Ellen Whitenger (yes) E.L. Koningsburg (yes) Robert Kormye (okay) oh, Gary Paulson, "Hatchet!" (woah) Beverely Cleary! (uh-huh) Don't forget about Harriet the Spy! (oh my gosh, hey what about R.L. Stein?)
Oh... GOOSEBUMPS!

[Kimya]
There's stuff for babies and stuff for kids
There's stuff for teens and senior citizens
There's stuff for young-adults and middle-agers
'Nuff stuff for all of us to get lost in the pages!
