Duck into an alley filled with urine and fat rats
Emerge from the other side, dawning a gas mask
It's on again, introduce the 808 mechanic
Slay satanic ways, my state's in a panic
Petro from wild animals that they let go
Suspect profile of the owners they kept low
Mysterious circumstance, serious consequences
My fury is to bomb another target, I'm not timid
Bricks through your window then I spit at the judge
Do my time standing up like a man won't budge
When these greedy motherfuckers try to take what I love
I write "greed" in red ink, let it drip like blood
Punk ass security, They circle in shifts
Seems like five minutes, but I time it at six
And I done come too far to go out like a bitch
So I chill behind a dumpster hit my target and dip
Shit, nobody out this time of night except graff writers, Prostitutes and pimps, drug addicts and backsliders
Box cut any motherfucker that try to fight him
Vigilante, Just another worker that got tired
Of mastering his zen trying to be on some calm shit
Arms folded hoping maybe karma resolves shit
Or on his hands and knees trying to pray on some god shit
So he go out into the dead of night and he bomb shit
The FBI stings, the activists got shook
Can't even buy a copy of the anarchists cook book
Entire databases, every crime, every crook
On every continent, every website, every book
But can't track what leaves no imprint
No digital or physical, no criminal fingerprint
So so subliminal, his criminal intent
The last one you ever would have pictured who did the shit
Now come to grips with your position of majority
That's thoroughly controlled by the few in the minority one percent
Since a kid, resented authority
And businesses made rich from the products they sold to me
They wanted to sleep but I can't chill
My nation full of people scared of taking that red pill
They're feeding us this garbage got our minds in a land fill
The American Dream is a dream,  It ain't real
