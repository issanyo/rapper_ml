This is my friend, Tony. He's pretty cool
Although he's not always so smart

(Aesop Rock)
And then there were eight (then there were eight)
Just like that
(Bring back Pluto, bring back, bring back Pluto)
In the beginning it was Large Marge sent me a bet:
Empty the rent if you can double-park the garbage barge gently
The moon took a second mortgage on the seventh house
Jupiter ain't talk to Mars, he felt the host of rovers sold him out

Close your mouth, poke your snout over the cloaked aroma cloud
Solar boy elope with couch choking on older Polaroids
Motormouth show for the golden molar toy
Gophers yoke a fish outta water, he grows lungs and multiplies

Idol. Once soldering a perfect union
It is vital to calculate any ornery loose ends
So if mutiny ensues, the aloof is assumed nuisance
The clue is in his vacancy, the proof is in his goosebumps

Maroon the traitors, expecting acres of edelweiss
Who later learn it may actually be safer to play with knives
I show up late looking project grizzly
Two bowies, a third for throwing, an accomplished dickweed
Nothing, nada, nil, I stuff a lot of pill to gut
What's the proper rules on stuffing hostages in trucks?
He'll be numb enough to chill before the choppers spill the blood
But if I'm not?

Fuck it
Plug him. Warpy got his goddamn groove back
Jet setting on spec with a dead
Yeti on the roof rack
And miscreants will rubberneck jalopy euthanasia
Which will later be regretted when it's your turn for cremation
And I walk like early man
Freak a little witch hunt
Gathering the carnies and exploiting every stigma
The malformed oddities amongst sovereignty's normal
Shall abuse every vice you can imagine right before you

All I thought of was the cloven hooved
And how they clip-clip-clopp over the woven roofs
With a nose for commotion and stolen goods...
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?
In the meantime...
Nine minus one left eight
In the meantime:
Nine minus one left eight
In the meantime:
Nine minus one left eight
We were busy putting barbs on a large iron gate
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
(Bring back Pluto, bring back, bring back Pluto)
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
(Bring back Pluto, bring back, bring back Pluto)

They're gonna want his milk money next

Stare into the glowing eye of Cerberus and crow
Authoritative laminates will not repel the quarantined alone
All the town simply know the Coke machine is home
Where they sit and hope the Ovaltine their nobles drink is strong
Couples-only roller rink was sole because of chicken you
Before they wiggle mittens between the pilloring of ridicule
And you can hear the iron maiden’s lock
Or see the town crier’s ankle stock chained up to the tanker truck
A is up early; ring and run, thank you much
Document a little of the underbelly bang-for-buck
A. I walk as the hype of the city gossip
Meaning every dumpster diver’s gotta vomit up a comment like:
You ain’t shit, this ain’t hell
This is little Russian dolls that get smaller and smaller still
This a corpse full of pills trying to sit still and build
Cause eight planets bullied Number Nine until he fell
Noooooo
Babylon goggles, garp for the Galvatron coppers
Tugboat, salvage all fossils
I’ll be shepherd while the whirlybirds thin out the lepers’ doctors
But if I'm not?

Fuck it
Tear up the metal hat and seasons
It’s as American as skiing above a plastic D-cup. Yup
Ya think Charlie Brown was Weathermen
Had us zig zag around these yellow backs for peanuts?
In the baggy stomach lining attached to the bums in hiding
Sits the morals every outing he slides to refine his grinding
When the freakishly disfigured have been triggered to surround you
You will live inside the actual second they let the hounds loose

All I thought of was the cloven hooved
And how they clip-clip-clopp over the woven roofs
With a nose for commotion and stolen goods...
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?
