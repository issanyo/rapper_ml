[Hook: scratched sample]
Bass for your truck

[MURS]
She keeps her biz booming down front street
Open with the funk so that no one wants beef
She the type who like to lay it all on the line
She say what's on her mind, that way it ain't a crime
The crime is that you show no shame
And you make those claims like you play no games
When in reality, you the biggest player of them all
The princess that wore the most layers to the ball
Trying to cover up when you laying in your drawers
You front like you a freak and everything you say is raw
But deep down, you really scared he's gonna leave ya
Your closet got more skeletons than the Dia De los Muertos
You worse than my perros
My dogs, that only fuck with broads from the ghetto
You date losers cause it make you feel superior
Try to tell me lies to justify but all I'm hearin' is the...

[Slug]
She seem like the type with no taste for shame
It walks like a snake then they can't complain
No, people love you and cling to them raw fumes
Keep it up so we don't see through your costume
She been a little queen since 15
In and out of different scenes, never kept her image clean
So critical, over-analytical
Fast forward, of course, old and miserable
Long trail of bread crumbs and head games
Bed bums, the best ones get pet names
First glance, you can see the dirt
Closet door wide open, no need to search
No, the truth is just an excuse
That you use to polish up a pair of selfish shoes
Take it how you want, but face up the front
Cause them skeletons dance to the bass...
