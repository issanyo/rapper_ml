[Verse: Aesop Rock]
The show shock reeks of smoke and gold bond
Home watching Ghost Dog on the phone with your mom
Ursus... ran from authority and churches
Pants low, Van Gogh climbs out his Cursive
Up in the night's middle, Penny on the tone-arm
Drones up, old guard slice you to tinsel, nice
Bump cenobites, loiter in the ship yard
Eat alone, read a poem from the Grimoire
Aes Rock, it's short for James Bond
My booking agent calls me Michigan J. Frog
I'm slow to come around, I'm quicker to plead the fifth
I'm kind of a big deal, I'm kind of a piece of shit
Burnt black T-bone taking the whole plate up
Grimace hitting switches like the ghost of Amadeus
The 808 mania come with a free puppy
Bass screaming "it's a free country"
The snare smoke Kools
Whiplash lovers sit pretty
Only dip one slipper in the world of the living, it's an issue
On his best days, he was barely there
On his worst, crooked apothecary
I feel that pure evil move among us in the grid
It's not always the kind that lose their lunches when they spin
This is not just paranoia this is something to eclipse
These are hunters from Gehenna, taking suckers to the crypt
Strange hours, maybe a weird neighbor
Runs on hugs and seasonal syrup flavors
In a tweed dearstalker, asleep in the nearest manger
I wake up into clear and present danger, days later
Habit of disappearing in a flash
I sort of find the rabbit hole endearing
You do your little damage and giddyup out of Kansas
To reappear in random famous paintings through the annals, and
Da Vinci gave him muscle, drunken Vinny took his ear
Mondrian and Rothko made him feel like a square
I'm the fabric of the image, I'm the canvas, I'm the pigment
I'm the buyer and the seller and the handler and the critic
Reporting the origin of sorcery and sin
Where a penny cost a nickel and a quarter is a myth
There's an ever growing chorus of the common feeling cornered
Impossibly abandoned, unequivocally orphaned
In the living room recording the voice of the unimportant
A fuck you from New Yorkers, maybe send this up to corporate
Take a second... A the one man four horseman
Stampedes, add a couple doors to the floor plan
Lunch with the wildlings
Level up, no tithing, grifters
Divvy out a thumbs-down therapy
Last seen speeding on a highway to... Where are we?
