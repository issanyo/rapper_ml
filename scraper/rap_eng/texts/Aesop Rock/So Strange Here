Now it seems to be so strange here (x2)

[Verse 1: Homeboy Sandman]
My dude
I'm in the Czech republic standing on a balcony nude
I pass up art for making art that I'll be able to clear
I'm told if I don't shave my head then it might hurt my career
I've wrote too much to memorize all my lines
I'm scared to share my thoughts
People get mad at me for changing my mind
If now I'm in the game why's it so hard to find a teammate?
Everything that's showing is a sequel or a remake
And every kid that's on the bus got the same kicks
Not only that but got the same dreams and the same wish
Shit that used be black and white is getting orange
Shit that used to be alluring's getting boring
Thought they loved me for my bars and my hooks
It turns out they love me cause of where I'm from and how I look
I never felt so sane
Success and failure never felt so same
It feels so strange

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
My dude
I woke a million miles away from my original muse
The very soil on which he learned to conquer Mario 3
Build a fire, and out-maneuver any mark of the beast
I speak an alien argot, New York amass in his tongue
The vibe is basically martian, they smell the Jack in his blood
I ain't the kind that use New York as a crutch, I use the force of the funk
Enjoy the work and earn my portion of mush
On a tour of the wild frontier, lying awake
I tell myself it's all to broaden my societal take
And while I sorta still believe it I'd be lying if I
Didn't admit I’d like to curl up on Long Island and die
It's not a science, nomads crash land antsy
Whether badlands or in back of the Plaid Pantry
Stick a flag in, the claim don't fade, find shelter and await old age
It feels so strange

[Verse 3: Homeboy Sandman]
I'm not complaining though
I got the contra spray with cupids arrows
Hitting shit I wasn't even aiming fo'
It's entertainment even shit that people hate me fo'
That's what they pay me fo'
Yo
And honestly
My fuck ups turn to gold so much the thought of fuckin up don't even bother me
So I keep it auto when i'm stepping through a portal
I know that sounds strange but, strange beats normal

[Verse 4: Aesop Rock]
I'm not complaining though
That's the way the daisy grow
We hide away and try to make
The best of what's available
My older homies think I'm kinda sorta schizo
I feel the same of y’all, but don't consider it a issue
We can openly embrace it or be trained to mostly tiptoe
Where shame becomes a staple in the nature of the crypto
That's a baseball through your window, a roach up in your shawarma
I know it sounds strange but, strange beats normal
