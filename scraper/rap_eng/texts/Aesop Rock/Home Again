I'm in a red zone
That's my miracle meridian
Boundaries lined with my minute men
Slipping in
S-O-S Messages float cold, captive in glass bottles
While timidly crash-test authors spawn mountains of trash novels
Diminished
Bone Crush
Skeletal Blemish
Sportin' super-fresh caffeinated-hate
Raise amalgamated shakes for the shield (yeah)
Yield to the mood slopes
With blue notes the silent launch lifted but I think the ground shifted when I walked
Yeah I'm the very model of a modern major general
Lip-twisted
You're pitiful
Sink
I think it was the tragedies of science versus the world's technical marvels
When Thermo-Nuclear Ace left the planet chemically startled
(Startled)
(I'm very effective I might add)
