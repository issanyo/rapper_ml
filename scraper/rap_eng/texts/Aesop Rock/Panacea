[Homeboy Sandman]
Lice done came along
And pulled some strings
To get that kidney transplant you been waiting on
The heroes fit to cheer up
Kanye n' kudi, and weezy
With they eyelids closed
And do the hardest yoga poses easy
Last time Rocky and Sandy was controllin' from the cockpit
Israel and palestine squashed it
Bump it from the wintertime to autumn
During morning noon and night
Til' you're old enough and never get another cold sore in your life

[Aesop Rock]
Lice is single-handedly responsible for spearheading
The conservation efforts that would leave the giant panda off the redlist
Revolutionaries in support of all day breakfast
Play the record for your mother she might let you get that Xbox

Unless you're hard of hearing
Unicorns should start appearing
Yetis walk up out the forest
You could score a jar of faeries

Solve world hunger when the bass break chains
Automatic good hair day for anyone in range

[Hook: Aesop Rock & Homeboy Sandman]
Who are they?
Say they name and the pain go away
Outta left field something off center
Skincrawlers make it all better

[Homeboy Sandman]
One track will make the one that got away come back
Run back with a rucksack full of rubs so that rugrats
Never run laps when you wanna nap
And all of that jazz
When you're strugglin' through a class you can't pass
And the teachers on a concept that you hardly can't grasp
And there's finals in a hour so you feelin' so tense
Bump the insects for some insight and it all will make sense

[Aesop Rock]
When I'm on the microphone
Teeth start whitening
Geese lay golden eggs
Seas part entirely
Governments abruptly guarantee the peoples' privacy
And everyday you find your keys before you cannot find your keys

Two to make a'choo who could make you shake the flu
See the folk who owe you paper pay you by today at noon
With interest, drums that come with a sense of friendship
Will feed your shitty cat while you vacation in the Hamptons

[Hook: Aesop Rock & Homeboy Sandman]
Who are they?
Say they name and the pain go away
Outta left field something off center
Skincrawlers make it all better

[Homeboy Sandman]
The alliance for gravity defiance
Think aloud until you figure out what happened to the Mayans
You should try it while you overdose you'll overthrow a tyrant
When it's over brush some dirt from off the shoulder of a giant
Once your mind's blown, after that you'll never drop your iPhone
You'll be able to touch your index fingers with your eyes closed
For relief that's long lasting
Lice is Miami Vice with race-blind casting

[Aesop Rock]
You will be accepted into social scenes and secrets clubs
You will always have hot water when you take your evening tub
You will never know a boat that doesn't know the sea of love
You will find your favorite ever pair of shoes for cheap as fuck

Keep the rats up out the city till the water
Reachin' every chorus foreshadow an extra week of summer
Listeners are winning trips to tropical locations
And tickets to the movies and dollars out in Vegas
