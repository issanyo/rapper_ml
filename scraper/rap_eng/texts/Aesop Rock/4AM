[Intro]
I consider myself a daredevil

[Hook] x2
It's 4AM
It's 4AM
It's 4AM
It.. it.. it.. it...

[Verse 1]
[Aesop Rock]
4AM, short of breath
Patient zero, hoarding pets

[Rob Sonic]
Drinking his omelet
Timing his meds
Morphine drip
Get a fix to the flesh
Gripping the edge of the ledge
Of the place where he gets to be met
With the end of the day
Left of the face is a table, a tray
TV Guide with the guy from The Fray
Or maybe it's Clay
Anarchy's son
Regardless
The farewell party's begun
Party of one
You start in the breach
Birthing a burden
Shouldering me
In tonight
The rest of the rat fam
Round and round
Like the death of a Pacman
Life of a salesman
Hiding his text
John Wayne couldn't even stand
The rein of my ex
Later I'll just
Go with phone tag
'Til the court tells me "Sure"
Now row the boat back
Hold the stoge pack
Get with the fall
With the beehive hair
And the rest on his bald
Head held high
Family, no joke
Grown folk broke
At the antique roadshow
Can't breathe right
In his noserbleeds
In his wing, they singing ring
Around the rosary

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
[Rob Sonic and Aesop Rock]
It's 4AM, pouring sweat
Patient zero, courting death

[Aesop Rock]
Use your illusion
And move
As a wounded gazelle
On a moonlit
Future in hell
I'm a loser
Room with a view
To a stupor
No real room
To acutely maneuver
A shoe
Nevermind two
In a sequence
He get down
To the root of the defect
Peep
Cruel is a pool full of deep ends
Prove an immovable defense
You in the beautiful breach
Unusually moody
And losing the beach head
Rats in the wall
Tap out drums
An amassing of non-retractable claws
This old man
He plays actual odds
On these detachable jaws
Not for the faint
Go moshing the paint
Cold dime in the day
By impossible day
Frog town creep
In a sensible car
No caution
Or obvious sense of tomorrow
Spit shake
Might steak or break the right
Nicely
Or instigate tonight's crises
Sample the you scream, I scream
Break if his eyes go widescreen

[Hook]
