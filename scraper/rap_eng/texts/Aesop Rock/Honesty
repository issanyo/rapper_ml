[Verse 1]
Been way too over active ever since my time was up
My life's expectancy is short compared to those whose kind to us
And I'm so tired of loss, dare I reciprocate?
Don't placate debates. Clever rhyming once the fireballs ripped
Shots fired overhead you better duck
Once upon a time I came up with a name and then it stuck
Son A. You haven't heard? No worries, it lacks importance
Distorted before the order was given. I give enough
Kicked the 4th wall down to draw the line between realities
Those living in a bubble will be popped by my analogies
Fallacies unchanged. We believe in what we want to
I think for there I am and not to think that is what will fuck you
When it comes to understanding I'm the one who fits the quota
Kodachrome via librettos as they tend to leave an opening
Knowing the whole tale makes it much less frail
But after 1000 listens it will show no fail and so
It is best to learn to never have your hopes up
So when you're disappointed from rejection you can float up
With your head above the water you are free to breathe and start again
Before the ton bricks returns to weighten where you stand

[Hook]
Put one foot in front of the other
Kick rocks as your marching down impossible summits
It's only when we're honest with ourselves we can conquer the day
Keep it moving to the spot you wanna stay

(Verse 2)
Been irate lately at a high rate
Gyrate past the normies staring with their eye brows raised
Crazed when caffeinated. Daze into the sky late
Throw a couple beats on then I spit till I"m dehydrated
Mind dilated formulating recipes
A clandestine emcee seeking manifest destiny
I'm Ebeneezer Scrooge when I do not accept the zealotry
The brevitys my weapon when it's time for me to demonstrate
Never one to think aloud
Been clouted by the off chance of failing in the field that I've devoted all my sanity
Time, money and energy. What's vanishings my vanity
Proud of what I made but lacking faith without the happenings
Throwing shade at me gets nullified when I'm the one
Who does enough that already and way more than anyone
A setting sun to to set the scene between the images thought
And so it doesn't seem as somber when involving the art
We all feel. There's no debating with this statement
Came up with a way to take the hatred out my nature
Honesty's corrupted when you customize data
I'm in rare form when you see my eyes resemble Radian's so

[Hook]
Put one foot in front of the other
Kick rocks as your marching down impossible summits
It's only when we're honest with ourselves we can conquer the day
Keep it moving to the spot you wanna stay
