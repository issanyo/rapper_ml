[Illogic:]
We the peak of bipedal civilization
Zombie style, steppin' through life in single-file formation
I see no foul, defacing the monument you all worship
On a quest to fall before you learn to crawl, immersed in inertia

[Aesop Rock:]
Okay, it goes novocaine skin, same skeleton within
I tip my swine pass to the zookeeper, then sneak my teacher in
Rusty angel with a DayGlo halo, predicate burner
With a car fueled with pediment, silkworm resident

[Illogic:]
My soul can bask in the rays of freedom reflecting from a seismic sphere
I'm lying here, very alive in speech, elated to be deceased
Immersed in words that reach the highest degree
Just now realizing that I'm an emcee

[Aesop Rock:]
I'm a corroded miner with a shovel and a pick
This tunnel stripped of all basic congeniality, muddy pig leg kickin'
Lickin' my chops for the fast-laners who never stopped in the kitchen
With an overall hate for the plate of coals, my fellows dig in

[Illogic:]
Now I think ink has to be the savior of my sanity

[Aesop Rock:]
The link wasn't supposed to be missing, hence the calamity

[Illogic:]
Webs of calculated deception lures words to demise

[Aesop Rock:]
So pocket your little sob stories and hand out goodbyes

[Illogic:]
Concrete passages float loosely in gravity defiance
Until moving at the speed of light twice removed
Non-aging soothed the savage feast of no-brainers
It's rhyme water in the form of Asian combat rhyme slaughter return

Retainer of mind, manipulative matrix talk
Life is a gift, and it makes its twist the politically correct
Intersect clefts of limericks, open doors to mimics
And allow the timid of herd in the rich

Shift to Warp 7, after I left heaven on a bed of eleven clouds
As the seventh son, am I never free to run realistically?
Simplistically dance on tables and be that imbecile that will never really be an artist
Or in this case impersonate one

You win some and you take some, attempt to recreate some
And some recreate you, if you allow them
Stepping in a place is to create yourself
Encase yourself in upper-shelf and never be heard
It's your choice if you want to be a waste of words

You want another serving? I know you can taste the words
Are they filling your tummy?
Mumbling wafted cadences over indigo loops with scarlet drums and a caramel bassline
They're unable to reprogram, that's why I hate mine

Thinking on two feet, next to the fire hydrant
Where puppies greet you with urine samples
With ample conformity in your system, you walk with urine-soaked slacks
Soaking in sensationalism, hatin' your wisdom

I see you're not amusing or amused as you're abused by the mic I hold in your other right, my left appendage
You're being abused by this mic that I hold in my other right (my other right), your left appendage

[Aesop Rock:]
There's a knot inside my gut that's growing faster by the day
So pardon my not showing up to your Saturday matinee

[Illogic:]
Now dive into the fishing hole, and retrieve the souls lost
Dangling from the hook and line, while I spill wine to kill time

[Aesop Rock:]
Nah, I'mma sit right here, and I'mma skip these stones
Until they realize that money couldn't buy a backbone

[Illogic:]
Please iron out the creases before blankets of thoughts are shown
Covering the hovering mass of wilted poems

[Aesop Rock:]
Wanna buy a lung? It's not broken, it just needs coaxing
Comes with a free five-minute warranty and tar coating
When fortune tellers turn Old Yeller, these propellers sputter through space
And dispatch they last smoke cloud in the name of good faith

These eyelids flitter for the love of little Hitler hybrid littering pleasant arena
[I pitchforks for the wiring and his heartaches mire dead man?]
Drew a triplicate-six day trip faded prior to time
Allowing the devil escape fabrication

[Illogic:]
Drilling through its shell right now

[Aesop Rock:]
I'll be there when it hatches
Catching z's on a mattress of matchsticks, ashes to ashes
Both confirm the high noon oil for life
Stuck my gutterbug intentions to the engine that repelled your candlelight (cinema classics)

Cinema classics, caught a man beat for living
I strike backwards with an iron fist driven through the skull of [malice?] siblings
Line 'em up like laminated rookie cards
While famine ate your fortune cookie shards

Ok, ready on the left? (I'm ready)
God, please, I was born sloppy on an origami tugboat in high seas
Now I spend simmering summers dragging bigger boats on home
To dock and soak in spotlit evenings, while I sweat and watch

Thieves, bandits, biters, and scum luring their sheep with a dead God
A broken promise in abundance
I am not a product of the blizzard, I don't sweat semiotics, baby
Half as much as I admire a clear "yes", "no", or "maybe"

So, um, here's the good 'ol gold-plated wingspan
Spread incredible or dead your pinnacle
Wipe your sweaty eyes, sigh, ease back
Television, pen, pad, dime weedsack, breathe, nap, then repeat

[Illogic:]
Never before have you seen two hybrids dismantle silence
Palms handle violence, dilating the candle virus

[Aesop Rock:]
Yeah, mummify the high, and they can teach mortals to float
And I'mma show you how Beelzebub and Serenity elope

[Illogic:]
We're shedding light on the otherwise dreary tomorrow
Leaving breadcrumbs in the streets for the cannibals to follow

[Aesop Rock:]
We weed a garden of stardom with ten dirty nails and a bucket
Waiting for the makeshift broken wing and dark angels to plummet
