[Verse 1: Aesop Rock]
(Yo Blueprint, let's put it on these cats. Check it)
Zig-zag Zeus fist
Fuse faction with a profile laced with flattery
Chatterbox wind up, ruined eyes a mechanism casualty
Lone satire sniper spliced infinite with water gun viper-ology then leaked
I'm Aes' vertical walking 12-step programmed to murky demeanor
Infomercial ready on request
I'm ready on the left/right discipline transaction
Is a grand wind mass spin a grimace collapsed integrity?
Hue capped in affirmatives
Dancing novelty nodders on the dashboard
Line up schools, I mean unison
Smash target
Shark are all at the market crash
My boogie knows lethargic in a sense I consider acres more relevant than pie chart fuck-up graphs and margin math
We get sorted with burnt crooked journalist mergers pertinent to high-life in the pig pen
D-D-D-Drone, six hundred sixty six separate pedigrees groan
Grown man wallow, hold can of soda pop and flint to burn the novels
My no-policy bred delinquents raised in colonies to smack gavels and shake a knuckle at ya
Triple throng amazing grace roll mayhem stem magnificent
Soothing with a little clip of doom for the honorees oozing innocence
Well, I'm floored
Juiced off the overcast holler, amused by the aptitude defogger
I play the role, a little lost disgruntled 9-5'er
And my jobby-job's a burden, but necessity's my father
So, uh-uh-uh-uh, clear the fuck out!
Offspring on a haywire syllabus camp production accustomed to drunk interruption
I love life but I despise some of the side effects like bouncing checks from my electric bill
With a stressing of red cent thrills
Don't buckle down 'til every last crop is harvested
Harlequins parade like lemmings parlaments
I spit a blade lace carol cause life's a barrel of charlatans
Overflow the moat and see which one of y'all motherfuckers could float
