(x4)

When I'm in effect, the days are all strange, boy in the box, the fever is all day
When I'm in effect, the days are all large, fire for the people the summer is all ours
When I'm in effect, the days are all grim, too alive once the chips are all in
When I'm in effect, the days are all close, woke up new, the city was all ghost
When I'm in effect, the days are all new, five in the sky, the muddy is all you
When I'm in effect, the days are all wild, food in the streets and clean-up in all aisles
When I'm in effect, the days are all peep, grown by his own, provoked the wrong sheep
When I'm in effect, the day is all raw, ten little workers, nine were all talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk...

Boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day...

Ease on down to the marketplace
Scope out anything with markerstains
The bus-stop glass like a targetface
Cap the delay where the archers aim
Ease on down to the catacomb
Crash into another man's babylon
No matter which path y'all travel on
We spin this city in a gravitron
Ease on down to the marketplace
Scope out anything with markerstains
The bus-stop glass like a targetface

Broke noose with a movie feud, in the same old feed
No news is new
Most soup on the food he grew, put a mouth full of crumbs
No news is new
Old troop with a loopy crew, but the skies ain't blue
No news is new
No flu had a loopty-loop, might slip into the stew

No news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new...

Fire in the sky with a focused temper
Two sides know it as a noble gesture
All the kings men let the poison fester when the knucklehead choir sang "No surrender,"

What a pretty light show you both have rendered
Put a strain on the number of folk attending
Aim for the gallery of open hecklers when the knucklehead choir sang "No surrender,"

All day
We was all 'ay'
Hopefully everybody lands okay
All night
We was all nice
Hats in the air, no more thin ice
All day
We was all 'ay'
When will the knots in the stomach go away?
All night
We was all nice
Victory swole at a roll of the dice
