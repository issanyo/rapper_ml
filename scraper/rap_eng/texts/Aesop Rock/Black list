Keep in mind this flow is used for practice
Even so still top choice off the track-list
Far as I know we've been blacklist
For as long as the earth rotate on a 23 degree axis

[Verse 1: MF Doom]
I can stop any time I want to
Famous last words that came back to haunt you
All your life, like permanent dried tears
Some cats get it like no bright ideas
He broke the record then bowed
Said he couldn't do it without the crowd, for crying out loud
Even took the time to contaminate the rhyme scene
And drop a lot before he was out, in the common scene
A lot of rappers are drama queens (buddy dutty ?)
When they come to the mic, I'm a feel ya's. (buddy buddy ?)
Fuck around and get your title took, cut and dry
He doesn't lie, even like who and where, what and why?

Hold it like a cue a button, button fly (boom boom) (?)
Once they leave the room, they be like, Doom! Doom! Doom!
It's no use. Blessed to design
And the villain has left the building, dressed to the nines
Like, I'ma do mine. Ya'll do yours
He stay reppin' the game like Lou Rawls
The super MF villain, feelin' like two balls
For the microphone, he joins like two falls. (?)
Well we'll see after these criminals who falls
A lot of ya'll is reminiscent of Rupaul
Ball to ball and we'll be needing new drawers
Drawers, the one-twos that run through walls

Keep in mind this flow is used for practice
Even so still top choice off the track-list
Far as I know we've been blacklist
For as long as the earth rotate on a 23 degree axis

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
All in it together now
Some of the misadventures of a father crop
My provider chop's flashin'
See, I'm a stop that gut reaction
Bound to tackles when a battle runs in circles
Like rodeo clowns with paddles
Poked in the belly by petty sarcasm
Gentlemen, start your laugh tracks
Push pins for the lab rat breed
All I wanna be is a fat cat sleeping 40 nights (nights)
In hopes that when I rise
The hacker mass will have seen there's more to life
Let's recreate a perfect service rooted in labor lust
And a discipline prisoner
I don't work a thick antithesis
Parallel park your burning prod adjacent
To the flagrant iron ego valve
Let us study a weaker outlet
I found peace (I found peace)
I found peace, it tap me on the shoulder
Asking where's the closest war and how to make it sleep
I pointed toward the exact place my sneakers met the credence
Said If I could answer questions (who), I would be relief
Now classify don't got em shook by exposing the skeletons
Yeah I sorta stick to a more murky-hurt development
Some of these kids are spittin' just a bit too delicate a thesis
If only Yeah, but holy jumpin' Jesus!
I get torn swiftly from a planet while it tilts, 23
Look buddy, we've gotta talk
God made me a fine instrument of style
Zig zag zisfiss?
Don't make me holy sleep bolts blindly until your mood shifts
Now here comes 40 acres of congruence pistons
Purple skeleton key immunity systems
Aw, it'll be something incredible
See, I know the limit
That's why I do my best to stay quiet
Whenever I ain't spittin' the gimmick

Keep in mind this flow is used for practice
Even so still top choice off the track-list
Far as I know we've been blacklist
For as long as the earth rotate on a 23 degree axis
