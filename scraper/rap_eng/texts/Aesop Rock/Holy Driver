[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]

Big red sun abort short cut caper
Highway humming door to orange containers
Lights on the runway ordered captain Kramer
Holding his heat and his cheek since Brainerd
Cargo, S.S. minaret, jeeper!
Neon read out on the Cineplex feature
Boom it in your sleep or in your set of sony speakers
Pigs on his wheels like they’re pepperoni pizza

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]

Start a wrong place / wrong time club
Might get, two peace fingers thru an A-OK Sign fucked
Lime green cricket, alpine flying white doves
Objects in the mirror made of daisy-chained light bulbs
Ape escape, corner by the cemetery death bells
Breath held, in his head he donkey with the red shells
Partly responsible for a string of wonky fish tails, party on or get your coffee chem-trailed

[Verse 3: Rob Sonic]

Jammed with the jelly, blips wipe the screen off
Space ball, grey walls, 8 tracks he bought
From Cleetus with the Jesus hat, bad breath and teeth gone
A couple missing fingers and a lap full of cheap porn
Born on the 4th on a bayou near a boom town
Never getting sweep please peep the way the broom sound
Tweaking leaking booze hound, eager to leave his roof down
Peanut reese's cheetos the visas are Mrs. Nussbaum's

[Verse 4: Aesop Rock]

I'm a liar I'm a nuisance, I'm a fighter acting mulish
I'm a license owning pile who went to driver's ed with Toonces
And early in the morning bore witness to the pie cut
Swerve on, serve a median that christian side hug
Bird dog, middle of the street, chicken in it's teeth
Shirt gone, caught a lure before the first furlong
Periscope up, metermaid pissy
I will see you in the tedious DNA of the city

[Verse 5: Rob Sonic]

Jerky on his jaw line rawhide Toro
Z’s in his alphabet soup stop, more Joe!
Squirrelly early bird brain given away the Morse code
Mini van kiddie hands mimic the way his horn blow
Mouth full of spit, belly full of the Jager cramps
Hot sauce wings and things crawl in his raisin bran
Green light, yellow light, headlamp header
Holy drive-by batman, Hand gestures

[Verse 6: Aesop Rock]

I escape new york like watching King Kong backwards
And you will know us by the trail of baffled dog catchers
On tippy toes, all gigantic net-swinging Baryshnikovs
Pattern like a final level peeled back to the mini-boss
Biggie on BLS, itchy palm, bead of sweat
Skidding in a ticking bomb, shitty brakes, jesus fish
Bumper stickers everywhere his other car's a sinking ship
My kid made the honor role, your kid is a piece of shit
