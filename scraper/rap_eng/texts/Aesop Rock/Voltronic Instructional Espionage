[Verse 1: JFK aka Ninjaface]
Initiate countermeasures, focus on his weaknesses and vital signs to read superior levels of a demon in time
And it's pertinent, make certain you shoot first
Reduce defenses to convert sidearms to mega burst
Activate chrome handle operating dismantles
Exercise bazooka tooth spit til you blow out his candles
Or give me a reason to spare his life and I will
Inanimate calls 25 to life closing in for the kill
The one to silence you with optical night vision
Position is completely in remission
With swift precision and the wicked intent with Reason to send this ballistic
Someone disturbing with objects nailed to the ground being lifted
? with pure adrenaline fused with music and the medicine induced through words silenced ?
The element in mind is quite profound and unstable
Download the override and assess the situation as fatal

[Verse 2: Onry Ozzborn]
Arms folded into a ninety degree angle beneath wing prepare for horizontal attack
As I allow verses to scream, as they flight
As if something was terribly horrific in this mind of this imagination be
Explanation for these tears, running down my face
Icarus ? for reasoning, what a waste
My capacity of balancing good and evil has been abducted and taken to dark development plague people
? Magician sorcerer without having to touch an actual individual being punished in someone
Soft spoken hoping that no one else will ever feel this threshold of breathless combination of pain and sufferance
The time has finally come towards this weapon of excellence
Or mega substance
This is what happens when trouble approaches feeling threatened Voltronic Instruction Espionage with no pretending

[Bridge: Onry Ozzborn]

Perimeter advisement
Location is agitated seven degrees climate
? approximate ? modulation encoded alien dominant
Vessel for launch hyperactivity humidity readings exceed the roof
Fatten gulp fiddle pat
Reason, prepare to download, BECOME BAZOOKA TOOTH

[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]
Steperfied soldier (Hi!)
Plug him in, set him up
Little Egor interns scrape the electric percent on up
'Zooka sent the phobia ops to let em settle up
Kick it like a beetle on its back with bad antenna up
He finger paints the city scape name and skips town
Kill it and build Rome in the same day
Children of the doylie generator burn early
Never got to witness worm flirting
Dog face boy clip wings
Wickedly slick, he know the message is still piss in a stream
And creams ain't worth the carbon
So when he fills the hollow tips with fire ants and load the teeth to park the bargain bin
? to parlor tricks, sleep with the marlin shit
Find Nemo then parallel parked from martyr bliss
As for me, I keep the blue collar popped
Til the Bazooka literally rot out the gobbled box
