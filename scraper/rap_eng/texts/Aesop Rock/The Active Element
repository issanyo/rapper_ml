I pilot a lion heart
My polar halves negotiate it (right)
Shook upon the difference between tumbleweed and sacred
Read a hostel gospel attributed to land shark Apostle squad
Unfroze the hideous image like hostile plots
Bat up in the belfry (help me)
I wanna be the reinvention of fire
In a most stagnate tension basket
Fenced in a cognitive learning facility built by the makers of stinger repellent
But fresh as the active element
Bag of bricks roped to a Saturn atlas hooked to madness
And I swear my new fresh air till the goblin cried, "fuck the rabbits" and rose
Most soloists cannot defend the mighty kingdoms that their passages propose, that's why I am the rose
New day, new reign, same old
Aches and pains, same old
Emaciated frame game, same name
Spring water ain't enough anymore
I wanna see the river and bottle my own crystal drizzle liquid dinner
Well aren't we the phoenix of irritant method
Here to steer the flock out the farmland while every shepherd rested
With a, head on the wall
Of sovereignty's halls
I be the head shaker in a sea of nodding novelty dolls
Let's, crush the arena
Flush the pipe dreamer
Touch the skull of each and everything
Everything everything
I am a scarecrow
Bullied by the bullies
But the masters had 'em walking in circles like eye patches
For the madness

One day, one ran
One cold, one poem
One way, one plain
One rose, one home
One strain, one pain
One fold, one zone
One element to many to made a hungry man moan
I'll be leavin now (I'll be leavin now) (it's not cool)
I'll be leavin now (I'll be leavin now)
I'll be leavin now (I'll be leavin now) (na-na nana na-na)
No I'll be leavin now (I'll be leavin now)

Everybody plug into the bludgeon
Follow your hunch and align the hunt collection
To count their blessings in abundance
Once in a crescent moon I'll adapt

To capture the essence's breakfast's participant's fishin' dissin' adventures
Heads gather from every battered aspect of the march
To swap gossip
Who parted what sea? and
Who's hungry? and
Who's parched?
And it gets tiring wiring the populace an anti grin and list of accomplishments
Beyond basic. Residence
Stick figures stand at attention, deficit
And all's well that blends well with a warm hazardous combine
Thick as thieves are they?
I bullied the wooly mammoth and champs
Germinate frantic decamped to the wino migration, examine
Eager to sport motley mosaic illustrate fallen pen-dragon
I'm from a room flooded with punishment
I've seen drunken sailors pilot they vessels to split the light house
Laugh at brown bag liquor list on there way home from the blood bath
Half angel with broken halo; half primitive rugrat
Spoken for by wild life's hybrid mutations and slum cats
Doom for dominion sluggish posture
See I wait a lifetime just to pierce these spears through the bellies of every monster
10 little warriors sit on a picket fence
Ordering themselves for protection of nonsense
Catapult the stone that struck the leader in the back and
Marked the beauty as the other 9 warriors worlds collapsed

One day, one ran
One cold, one poem
One way, one plain
One rose, one home
One strain, one pain
One fold, one zone
One element to many to made a hungry man moan
I'll be leavin now (I'll be leavin now)
I'll be leavin now (I'll be leavin now)
I'll be leavin now (I'll be leavin now)
Notice I said I'd be on my way out the door
I'll be leavin now
I'll be leavin now
I'll be leavin now
I'll be leavin now
I mean the doors almost closed
I'll be leavin now
I'll be leavin now forget it
I'll be leavin now
I'll be leavin now
I'll be leavin nowâ€¦
