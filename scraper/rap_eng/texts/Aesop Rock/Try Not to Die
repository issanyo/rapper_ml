[Verse 1]
Yo, broken glass everywhere
Aesop Rock pissing flares on city staircases next to the base heads
Follow holographers spitting crowd mayhem simulation
To feed ego blood arraigned, then launch operation food chain

Sleepwalkers pile at the eyelets down (flash vipers)
So they catch a bad one like one eyed graf writers
Its utterly stunning inside the great escape chase where
Kitchy snitchers crowd outside clouds of suspicion like
"I'm one look in the first place"

They capcorder certified A-1 blue ribbon sucker pride
To be preserved mammoth out glacier, run away by prize
With broken dignity
These wooden wings got your fellow jealous
But when a boy may detect every lie, "I can fly"

Looky here we the digital hyena click serpents (surface)
I'm a third straight citizen, stellar
Caught up in, no
Brought up in a cripple triple six lidagin cellar
Where under a creaky step huddled to scorn of this old yeller

Yes, you feeling that?

Maybe they didn't understand the ramifications encased in the new Blockhead dental plan
Hit it squirt
Run of the litter
Warpin' morsel
Camper
Mommy's little helper
Pumpkin
Puppy dog, I'd fuck up suck trouble

Tractor
Mix your little pigtails Mr. worst version of burden born dead
I'm over your product
Your living existence is but a wing nut on the training wheels
A bitch called politic cycles
Idolizing germ breeding and worm bibles

Now when I say it’s on don’t percolate pimp strut
Miss delicate whiz
Maybe you ain’t graspin' how on it really is
Identify futility
Curtsy that poodle skirt
Pirouetting veterans get urine mickeys
Sipped and begged for settlement

[Hook]
So long, good bye
Have a nice day, try not to die
Be good, farewell and have a wonderful trip
Try and not let your pretty little heart skip

Be strong, keep your head up high
Try not to fall into an awful style upon your first try
I'll see you the next time you decide to come visit me in the zoo
And by then I just may have written a song about you

[Verse 2]
And if you lookin' for a friend
You knockin' on the wrong door holmes
And if you lookin' for donations
You got off on the wrong floor holmes

Follow twelve steps; the perfect vivisection
Honor thy alignment with mercury climate surgeons
First we meet 'em, then we burn 'em

I can pick apart skylines that foxtrot on your legends
It's yellow jacket upon saccharine spillage (child spirit)

A pow with a wild gear shift
I'm Jesus Christ with wings and nicotine love
Pick a dream cause it won't be there when your beer tips

Now you can let the horns blow 'til you're blue in the face
You preach the end of your rope before the dawn of the shoe laces

As far as I'm concerned

Every lost lamb sees through a bulls-eyes
The hand that feeds happens to hold a hammer and a lie

I sell prosperous futures in bottles to freaks with awful karma
You're an early Wright brothers experiment

Surrogate mother television
Born where the peasant kids bought her deficits
Lack of attention vs. lack rockin' for the hell of it

Monkey thirteen
Seen with a broke crown around the bend
Pissing on cloud nine from cloud ten

I can sit at the well's bottom alone
Rockin' a coffee mug
To fish the offering of every little late nip penny toss' wish

You're the reason god made vacations (ok...)
I'm the reason god made the people that made god make vacations
I mean it's all got to balance, right?
Scrape digital spear across belly
Settle back-lit worms back by Saturday night

Walked hungry

My seal is stitched out monopoly money
I'm a turntable with new needles
Life's a barrel of junkies
Screaming "shove them in"

Cuff em' in purgatory, gloat
Please don't be the motherfucking tug boat

[Hook]
So long, good bye
Have a nice day, try not to die
Be good, farewell and have a wonderful trip
Try and not let your pretty little heart skip

Be strong, keep your head up high
Try not to fall into an awful style upon your first try
I'll see you the next time you decide to come visit me in the zoo
And by then I just may have written a song about you
