[Verse 1: Aesop Rock]
My search history ain't glamour and glitz
More ramp plans and "Can a man be a witch?"
One Stan Smith five toes curled in the sand
Free a bird from a cage
Feed a squirrel from his hand
Greet a world with the rhyme face
Don't play fair I'm all
Eyes made of coal I'm all
Snakes for hair I'm all
Side-scrolling eye contact over speed chest
Blink once get a king deep sixed
Aes boogie
Brain getting mushy
No brakes still break for a plate full of cookies
How his shoes so clean? He barely house broken
Mold unclean air in our wild moments
Focused overgrown topiary uproot
Rosemary middle fingers poking out the sun roof
Donuts in the parking lot yelling duck duck goose
Fuck drums pull your guts from your jumpsuit, ah

[Chorus: Aesop Rock & Homeboy Sandman]
Stop the bleeding (x4)

[Verse 2: Homeboy Sandman]
Duck duck goose
Buck buck duck duke
Pushing and shoving
Shucks, shoot
It's gotta be the shoes
Early to rise
It's gotta be the snooze
This chicken is dry, yo can i be excused (thanks)
Print you out a boarding pass
Get an autograph from the earth man
Who don't believe a single thing
He didn't see firsthand
Ain't up on the laundry list of accomplishments
See a burner on the side of the Washington monument
Don't panic, the kid drop jewels
Like his true love died on the Titanic
I'm go from being all
"Leave me alone" timid and mild mannered
To all muscle and brawn bigger than gigantic
Sun splash multiple "and ones"
All in a day for the can't miss
I run fast even in handcuffs
A little wave to the blacksmith, bitch

[Chorus: Aesop Rock & Homeboy Sandman]
Stop the bleeding (x4)

[Verse 3: Aesop Rock & Homeboy Sandman]
Ooh-eee true indeed
Tuna to the truancy
Suit 'em up two cents
Choopin[?] out the mutant league

Tissue full of mucous in the mutiny
Dig a tunnel cuddle with a wolverine
Sweet, sheesh

Flowers growing from his feet
Grass growing out his ears
Beard made of poison ivy growing for a thousand years

Shift the planets to alignment
Feels so good like being reunited
Mad i'm stylin' while assigning volunteers

Ready player one?
And get the whole fly neighborhood howling
Joust through a crowd scene drowsy

Player two not sure when to say or do
'Cept to stay up
And to say a prayer when you pay a due

Stares at his feet when he speaks to the law
Stares at a screen I'm a freak I'm a flaw

God bless my neighbors for the papers I can cheat off
I'm too wired to dream too tired to beat off

[Chorus: Aesop Rock & Homeboy Sandman]
Stop the bleeding (x4)
