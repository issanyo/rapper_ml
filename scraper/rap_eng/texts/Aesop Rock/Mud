[Verse 1: Homeboy Sandman]
My name written in blood
My sword covered in rust
My songs written in mud
I'm in the trench with no one to trust
The things I counted on been ground into dust
God bless the child of its that sprouted underground with the C.H.U.D
Except for falling in love
Ain't no better feeling on the earth
Than getting the smirk
Wiped from off of your mug
Undecoded and been voted "The Least Likely to Budge"
Taking chances where the answers always "all the above"
Good luck calling my bluff
Had to lay the hammer on your hunt and gathering stuff
It was rather abrupt
Set the balance for battalions too wary to lug
Rations across a battlefield
That's barren
Shit is barracks or bust
Nobody taught me not to stare at the sun
Only photocopies for the class to share and discuss
Man, your mathematics may be fine for finding the sum
But that ain't nearly what's up

[Hook: Aesop Rock & Homeboy Sandman]
I'm covered in that grit
Covered in that sludge
Covered in that muck
Covered in that mud
See, I'm covered in that sweat
Covered in that blood
Got covered in that stuck
Covered in that mud

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
Yeah, time to make the donuts
Eat, drink, annihilate the bogus
Wide awake and snarling
The dark wings opening on my darling
I speak in holy code and keep the rodeo alarming, homie
Old eyes parrot a roach that won't die
Slow night spirit looking for a hive to ghost ride
Over the river through the woods
I eat the bread I spoon the mush
Keep it dirty, we prefer misshapen over cookie cut
My office hours are noon for thirty seconds
Then it's off into the tempest for berries and buried treasures
Trade tall tales with lepers and lost dogs
Swing claws at pinatas and the shapes of all y'alls
Hey, the new voice of a defective species
Reflect from the cheap seats
Checking his cheat sheets
Eat a raw horse heart
Yum, yum, four stars
At the fork is a forfeit of a foreign march

[Hook: Aesop Rock & Homeboy Sandman]
I'm covered in that grit
Covered in that sludge
Covered in that muck
Covered in that mud
See I'm covered in that sweat
Covered in that blood
Got covered in that stuck
Covered in that mud

[Verse 3: Homeboy Sandman and Aesop Rock]
Swap a ace out for a joker
Rise with the rebels, feisty, feral
My poker face is not for playing poker
Never die, never shy from the pedal
The number on my ticket reads eternity
Up in the wee hours, bark in a building
See it
Feel it

I'm steady as the fingers of a surgeon
Aware the destination is as absurd as the excursion
Aware that the extent of the hilarity will vary
And the climax and the ending all depending on the version

Spongebob PJs, dreaming of deep space
Sleep spooning a nuclear briefcase
Spoon sugar till his teeth ache, three cheers
Two for his team, one queen in the [?]

[Hook: Aesop Rock & Homeboy Sandman]
I'm covered in that grit
Covered in that sludge
Covered in that muck
Covered in that mud
See I'm covered in that sweat
Covered in that blood
Got covered in that stuck
Covered in that mud
