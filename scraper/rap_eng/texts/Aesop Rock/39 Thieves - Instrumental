And it is with the dogs with their rifles, thousands of them line the pavement, like patients pupae waiting to become worms

Another dark night, teethin the market of B-sheep, like I'm walking around the 39 thieves in a beat spores of a warm Helvetica brown proper for the odd gutter monster propped on the teleprompter, wild blue yonder blue in the face angel blew into the bugle in lieu of the euthanasia, usually the shooter community chew the corpse but I see the wolves have already gotten to you and yours, day of the dead play the ledge closely train the barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey, dope, the gonzo have always felt choked socially, stole the golden fleece with the culture of total nobodies earth lies divided by fighting tribes all we do is watch em waddle back and forth lighting fires (money money) detonator wire cutters pliers two cities and one is broken up in tiny tiles and I walk, pose, harmin the heart of the lion's throat for a photographic children of my primordial growth, you parade around a kill so damn proud like a flat-line fetish had his feathers fanned out, war totem symmetry, skip into it gingerly, silk worms ping pong minister to ministry, hells bells every which way the winds blows, so I bang my head against any wall you can build, go

Another dark night, another not alright, another bad ritual, war-bot surgery, better follow the bread-crumbs back, in fact, urgently, there's water through the session where the natives feel murder-y, vicinity wandered claim no zone never let an anchor drop never had a home never talk to strangers never trust a friend, this is the life and the life will not end
(Money money money money money money...)
(Good as new, good as new, good as new, good as new...)

Next time think, 39 thieves, quicker than 40 winks, raise your drinks, 39 thieves, quicker than 40 winks
Why are you consumed with the community aloofness, dude we're animals we'll just go where the most food is, lower the toast most former letter-kid is useless, truth is you're equally expendable as spoon-fed, (money money), money is cool I'm only human but they use it as a tool to make the workers feel excluded, like the shinier the jewel the more exclusive the troop is, bullets don't talk bribes stupid, they shoot shit

Another dark night, down it goes, tread around the rabbit hole, weapons to the heavens and arsenic where the carrots grow, piss warm suger water where the summer canteen plus burn rubber like green is the new green, rubber neck froze, slows by the multiplex, rodeo commotion I'm open to see what culminates, bourgie on the right, left rep rebel force, both say the futile "prove the parking lot was never yours," black top pebble bores, soldiers molded when the joneses every grown-up in Dakota came to groping, no motives they showed em the gross quotas, hog barn burner come see if your home told us, 85 rattle trap park the fancy, he could swear he was steppin outta Comanche, antsy, let us in he jettison the medicine and paranormal hatchery condense and break the levees in (money money), we both know the totem camaraderie, tokin' up equality, they posted horizontally, pride of golden load the doctor brought a lobster colony, half-mass slags have caps through em properly, and sleep the sleep of the just, ready on the left when the witchcraft spun it with a neighboring sect, with the usual undesirables and the Big Brother cutters, on the day your name became "This motherfucker?!"
