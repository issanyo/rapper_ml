[Verse 1: Kimya]
I was feeling master blasted, lost my id, my anti-entity
And just because it's real to you it isn't not pretend to me
And did you know my Elbro taught me positively everything
I never didn't know about double negativity
Have you been unfollowed for misogynistic dickiness
Sitting home alone in a pool of your own stickiness
Jerking off to your own tweets iPhone on the shitter
While you insult everybody else for what they write on Twitter

[Hook: All] (x2)
My delivery is speedy, can you mc'feel me?
Banana midriff, so appealing
My head is in the clouds and my feet are on the ceiling
The foundation is much uglier than what it is concealing

[Verse 2: Kimya]
Here's a little bit of Miami advice
For when your hand is down your pants and there's a gun between your eyes
And she cocks it the minute you cream your jeans
You say "Baby do you wanna ride my sound machine?"
She'll say "No" but she'll laugh and drop the gun I think?
And say "Do you wanna hear the story behind my new ink?"
And she'll say "Hey little man why can't you see there is no spark?
Take off your socks put on your shoes and go get eaten by a shark"
If I don't set aside time for writing songs I go insane
The stuff that's left unsaid just turns to static in my brain
It's hard to get things done when my head is full of craziness
It's when I am the busiest that I seem the laziest
I'm sending off my monkeys on the backs of the pink elephants
So it doesn't matter if my lyrics are irrelevant
Tossing out my thoughts like handfuls of confetti
Add a little strummy strum and I feel better already

[Hook: All] (x2)
My delivery is speedy can you mc'feel me?
Banana midriff, so appealing

The foundation is much uglier then what it is concealing

[Verse 3: Kimya]
I was feeling overrated, I was feeling under smarted
When you looked me in the eyes and then it smelled like someone farted
Was it man or was it beast or was it just my upper lip
Was it an Olympia hippie or just a New York City hipster?
(What's the difference?)
As well all try hard to make this world better
If it's thrift or if it's vintage it is still your grandpa's sweater
Either way three cheers for you
Cause its better to reuse than to support the corporations buying crap they mass produce

[Kimya] (Repeated with choir)
You think, you think, you think
You think I'm preaching to the choir but I am not, I'm not
I'm singing with the choir
We are all birds, birds of a different feather
We each sing the way we sing and we are all in this together

[Aesop Rock] (x6)
You think I'm preaching to the choir but
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
I'm singing with the choir again
I am, I am, I am, I am

[Kimya] (x4)
We are all in this together
