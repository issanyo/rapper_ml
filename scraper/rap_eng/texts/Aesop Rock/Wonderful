[Verse 1: Aesop Rock]
Born in a flood on a frontier, at first light, nurse like
"You should not have come here, scumbag"
Out a love shack into a bloodbath, hustling
Young king snakes through skull tats
Knowers of the whole half, Hulk smash overture
One man motorcade, none stand holier
Cowabunga houses of the holy fuck in free New York
It's hoodie over goalie mask, for Obi-Wan two three and four
And five and six
Open for the broke as hell and high as shit
Who write survival music, nevermind the tiny violins
Nevermind the icy-handed racketeer
We're smashing atoms here, it's oranges and apple care
I'm only out of bed to grapple with the hanger in the rabbit ears And pass a little data through the atmosphere, bump in the night
Black hearts under the knife, money, it's a wonderful life

[Sample]
Some people they live life
Not with my money
It's how we do it though
You really had a wonderful life x2

[Verse 2: Billy Woods]
Only as he died
Was there a true assessment of wasted time
Field of dreams full of landmines
Schemes over landlines
Early girl, swirl, spit her out like wine
Edge of the world, I'm where sherpas climb
Fragrant smoke curl in forgotten shrines
Pith helmet, Quinine, waves like crime
Below deck slaves lay supine
Blind lead blind cyclops rock shines
Ghetto Versailles dusted pantomime
Fly wigs spry jester's jibes
Iago in the wings eyes like knives
Santa's sleigh bring ways to slay kings
Conflict ice in his Super Bowl ring
Lufthansa heist be like his usual thing
Equality of man once the shrapnel fling
Drive 'round till that transponder ping

[Sample]
Some people they live life
Not with my money
It's how we do it though
You really had a wonderful life x2

[Verse 3: Homeboy Sandman]
Dry saliva scent
I will survive in less than five attempts
I got a bad case of the whatchamacallits
I caught it crawling through the vents
Bread and circuses
For all purposes and all intents
But hear me out
The pornographics of poison gases is hella graphic
I cite my sources, they're mostly scorpions and yellow jackets
Obi-Seven wielding force of habit
Bringing home the bacon
Faking out the telepathics
Another classic
Another ass to kick, file it
My steel toe got a lotta mileage
Tryna teach the scum to use the sun to tell what time it is
Something's gotta give for gods and generals far as minerals and vitamins
Service with a smile and know the aisle where your item is
Live from Emerald City where the glass is greener minus all the Heinekens
Holy spirit that's been cleared to smear your sciences
And clear your sinuses
