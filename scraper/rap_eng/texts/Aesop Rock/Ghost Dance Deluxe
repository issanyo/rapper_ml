[Hook: Slug]
Ghost dance deluxe
The eyes open, approach for the touch
My ocean is rough from the storm
And I hope that love will keep me warm
So I ask for a

[Verse One: Murs]
Heard the rumors in the mist, Does she really exist?
Qualities to qualify, man I got a whole list
Whispers in the hall ways, missin' her always
Talkin' to myself, I don't care what y'all say
Fantasy phantom, this is your anthem
My mystery madam disappearing at random
A band on her finger, I heard it traps the ghost
But she never lingers long enough for me to come close
When I catch Miss Perfect I'm gonna give her that ring
Her friends keep tellin' me there's no such thing
But forget material girls
I need a paranormal chick from an ethereal world
Thought I saw one once and I just couldn't deal
How could I commit when I know she's not real?
Standin' by the sea with my Ghost In A Shell
Your flesh is flawed and I know this well
So
I must make my decision
Passin' up the real deal, waitin' on an apparition
And one day soon I'm gonna get it together
Cause I can't leave this night light on forever

[Verse Two: Slug]
It's no big deal, nothing to trip about
But I know it's real, there's one up in my house
She floats, flies, moves with grace
And she's not just a side effect of my imagination
I can hear her voice in the air
It's right there, it ain't paranoia man, I swear
Female, delicate little iris
I might be possessed from the glimpses I catch
I don't run, I chase it
Through every room from the attic to the basement
I pursue, by virtue
Got me up late, way past my curfew
Stay awake, she's on the staircase
Not scared face, not one hair raised
It's not even frightening
Nah, I love it when she sing
And I wonder what she might bring
Ghost lady, you make me so crazy
You smell so good and you look Oh-mazing
I don't just need you to want me, you got me
And I keep you to haunt me
