[Verse 1: Homeboy Sandman]
Somebody shoulda told ya
Up to something looking like a young somebody older
Who keep a toolbox in his tube socks
Who keep a boombox full of moon rocks
What was written was the hittin' of a snag
Reminded of the benefits of picking off a scab
I took an axe, lust for penetration left by Skinemax
I laid down on the tracks and took a nap
Hit it!

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
Hit it!
This is when you line your little bastards up
Set aside a muster point then run and get your candle snuffed
Suckers get abducted by a clustering of animus
Where street performers only juggle cutlery and cannonballs
Muscle through the analog, a part of something heavenly
Rubber duckies in a row and Tetris-ing, it's therapy
Raiders of the multiverse in bumper cars that don't reverse
Make a move, maybe you should grow out of your floaties first

[Hook: Aesop Rock]
Speakers of an unknown dialect
Each breath comes with it’s own environment
You lack the minerals and vitamins
Treat hacks like flies to the spider-web
Don’t ever count the kid out…
Don’t ever count the kid out…
Don’t ever count the kid out…
Don’t ever count the kid out…

[Verse 3: Homeboy Sandman]
I’mma burn rubber on your cue
I’m rubber and you're glue
When there’s no signal to call truce
Real living ain’t much different from cartoons
Oh brother, good gracious, and gadzooks (Listen)
God willing your top billing ain’t past due
Amigo lose the ego if it need to be stroked
This month’s flavor of the month is, hickory smoked
Come on over spend a moment wit the nomad while he packin light
Tricked into identifying things that didn’t happen right
There’s another zit from wishing that I could go back in time and fix the things that make me lose my appetite
That’s about American as apple pie
Questioning the sample size
Pupil’s peeled for something miniscule that I could amplify
Hey stranger would you like to be my friend?
Thinking that you’re like me though will likely be my end
Then again

[Hook: Aesop Rock]
Speakers of an unknown dialect
Each breath comes with it’s own environment
You lack the minerals and vitamins
Treat hacks like flies to the spider-web
Don’t ever count the kid out…
Don’t ever count the kid out…
Don’t ever count the kid out…
Don’t ever count the kid out…

[Verse 4: Aesop Rock]
I was on stilts trying to build with angels
You were crying over spills at the children's table
There there, never been a shill for the shameful
He mainly, chills, laying bricks on his Grayskull
Even if it kills him, pissed off, quit the pills
I don't sip what the system sells
I'm in the distance, tied to a cartoon rocket
Death proof, dressed like an art school project
Walk on the wild side, smile and a swamp hat
Low-fi pro invoke trial by combat
Ah, mile-high Aes say grace over Wattstax
Aim for the gong or the conman
I’m an odd one, I’m a crazy 8
Call top bunk, do the stanky leg
Gather ‘round and watch a rabble rouser radiate
Radio invaders breaking atoms at the Steak and Shake

[Hook: Aesop Rock]
Speakers of an unknown dialect
Each breath comes with it’s own environment
You lack the minerals and vitamins
Treat hacks like flies to the spider-web
Don’t ever count the kid out…
Don’t ever count the kid out…
Don’t ever count the kid out…
Don’t ever count the kid out…

[Outro]
Don’t ever count the kid out…(x4)
