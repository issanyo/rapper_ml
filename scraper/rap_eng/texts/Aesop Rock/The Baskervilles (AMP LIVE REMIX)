[Intro: Aesop Rock]
"AaaampLive"


[AESOP ROCK]
When the bright bright play-doh met the mania’s mittens
In twenty minutes it was Kratos on some Blade of Olympus
Pimpin’ his questionable cargo to your district’s most suspicious
Who sort of whored the mischief making business to its limits
Volunteers line up with your purple hearts and common-spears
Shake ‘em ‘til the getaways are localized and commandeered
Ate the Cobalt-60 kid of tripping over hiccups in the grid
And let his hounds go Baskerville up in this bitch

[YAK BALLZ]
Yeah his faces form a queue and all breath together
Propose a toast when you’re comatose: Hear, hear!
What a nice gesture
All the while the stupor has him sleeping through the terror
We breezing through to the future, like, “See you never!”
Anatomically prolly with physiques too slender
To muscle and tustle, I weigh in but will not let up
For consecutive seconds executive decisions
Make for preventative maintenance to the best of my interests

[AES]
At a blistering pace ‘til his fisher king
Legs decide a paralysis would make it interesting
Thanks!
He’s in traffic breathing out a little easy, heed the magic
Speaking dizzy as a kiddy in n out his mini graphics
Smash his illy in the back
I’m in the bunk and feeling actual
Rogue
Like its wait-a-minute bait-and-switch is casual
Weatherman skulls to the pendulum doze briefly
Sharpen and repeat, life’s easy

[YAK]
[?] Beastly in the morning to the evening
Sinks his teeth into meaty reading
For protein and meaning
It’s no secret, to each his own
We feed and it grows
We eat in unison; they’re apart, we leave it alone
Plant the [?] into the art, you reap what you sow
Show a sea of them who you are, they’re eager to know
[?] asleep when they’re crawling back, falling out
Solar panels melt into the tats
When energy hold your glass
