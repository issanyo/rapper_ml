[Verse 1]
"A" is like a different type of animal
No brick road, no zip code Xanadu
Family, his and-what-army party in the panic room
Before he meet the man he feed his hands into the scramble suit
Glam channels wake up in a fantasy dismantled
We're championing vandals over Andy with the Campbell's
He the cold-hearted old guard, Holy Ghost crowbar
The postcards only know Crayola, no Rose Art
Ill communication aside
I'll kick a train off a bridge, I'll smack a plane out the sky
I'll throw a car into the ocean, no one waving goodbye
Place bets, eight heads and the radio flyin'
The kid Tobacco is a face in the fire on the fucking mountain
The bass is like a struggle of defiance
Love and power for Bettys and headhunters
Techies and chess-clubbers
All I do is eat bread and check suckers

[Verse 2]
Nobody safe, chump, black plague, railguns
Cache of your rat snakes coiled up in the bass drum
Dug graves with over-the-hill skate punks
Failures and flakes in the brain trust, pay up, ayy
My Bugs Bunny tunnel-out is perfect
Don't be there when we bubble to the surface, usurpers
I pay the rent in pennies and ride off into the ether
On a donkey painted like a zebra, take me to your leader
Detox, re-tox, see how he seesaws
Mistletoe a misanthrope, stick-and-poke sea dogs
You can't imagine all the misery we leap frog
I make rap, I ain't a motherfuckin' peacock
Death raft floating out to sea
Under a single flaming arrow down to overcook the meat
And if a silhouetted man is seen emerging from the flames
You should probably treat him different even if he look the same
He isn't

[Verse 3]
I make a mean Suicide Big Gulp, sick pup
Google eyes splinter off the unified witch-hunt
War and love, hailing from the home of the Anthora cup
And 40 nights of failures out to plagiarize the formula
Been seen petty spoils void steady acumen
I'd rather be avoided, a voice of the Voynich Manuscript, boy-o
Type to give a name to a sword
The skulls of his landlords hang from his horse
Medium kahuna, strange force around him
Houndsmen scrounge for a sirloin to pound thin
I play my chess with undomesticated groundlings
We spend our afternoons forgetting how to downshift
"Aes ain't here, man," "Aes, I can tell it's you"
"Tell it's me from over there, this ain't a fuckin' petting zoo"
Brain cells peacing out, dentures in a Dixie cup
Devil trying to keep me down, somebody pick me up
