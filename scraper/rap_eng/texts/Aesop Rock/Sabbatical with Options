[Intro: Sample]
"Are you leaving for the country?
You say the city brings you down"
"—dniheb—"

[Verse: Aesop Rock]
I hung a lung over the only oak in BK
This was after having perused every crook-nook tucked in a scrupula
That the growth of the neighborhood on his last city b-day
And as they ushered in the kiddies, handing each one that gift-wrapped Louisville aluminum
Swing batter chatter box
Black tar gather at a scrape for the cake going six from the bus traffic half a dozen summoned from a love of drug magic
Fire in the max cap beater need a beer from his fierce drug habits and heaters under the mattress
Love 'em all to death but I'm slowing down faster and I know this town backwards
Lookin' at him different cause he boasts with no liquor in the glass he wet his lips with
Never preach for the rights or relatives, but I reach for the clicker if the picture isn't helping 'em
Bet he bleached up, shimmy at a seat belt, Jimmy over city limits, giddy-up and leap
Left, he steps with a duffel bag shuffle
Most don't focus so his folks won't notice
Those old jokes don't hold him with the voltage of the moldy hocus pocus heat a geezer mostly grows with so

1985 Dodge Ares hand me down freebie piece of fucked with shit with the fuckin yellow plates you are going to start for me
Do not do this today, look, man, look you have been very good to me, okay?
I'm gonna start the ignition I'm gonna point you in one direction, all you have to do is go look I'm not even gonna steer man please

I am so dangerous, in another frame lame get a wet peggin' F on the octane cater full tank pull rank mater mater
Fall off to adhere to look, three tears cookin up here's to the shrunk empire city stuck in the rearview
He get gone. Why? I dunno, had an itch, had a flame at both ends of the wick center in a brick ran him off ditch
Let alone mad piper I don't wanna rat pack when a back's set for a tap spinal, get away bad driver
Eyesight like a bat's and a bad license both got a bronx zoo with a lockpick kid slip back by the last vipers
And tigers and bears you will hold down new york, I will be back to reclaim if I'm bored

They like "Oh, Aes' buggin yeah he gonna leave", they said Well that's a bit of a radical process
I was like "Hey man, I put my time in, I gotta, I gotta do somethin man, I tend to call it my sabbatical-with-options"
I might be back, Here's to you and you and you, y'all are the ones, you're gonna come see me
I'mma have a fuckin bash, country crib man for a minute, at least try this shit, man, I been a long-ass time to get this fuckin house, I can't deal with this shit
