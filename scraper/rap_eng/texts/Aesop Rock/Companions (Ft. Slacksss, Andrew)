(Son Anthony)
Sitting idle waiting for a call to action
Our cauldron is lacking snacks for we are ravenous tykes
Still we badger on mics instead of acting like craftsmen
Considered daft. To I, a chasms a small distraction
The happy mask salesman here to transact face lifts
Which makes this a job a whole lot tougher on day shifts
Through raps I can melt them, but I try to obtain them
Sent to lead my fellow angels like my patron saint did
Sweeter than a soda pop, I'm only here to photo-bomb
And focus on the middle of my forehead to notice God
I know that I’m heavy into coded type of bloated rhymes
Their picturesque like a Kodak moment high off a coke head's lines
I have brokered this track to smack enemies
Pissed off by everything I see or that is sent to me
I'm older than a century but still so young
The longevity I claimed came from this Ginsu tongue

(Hook)
You are my best friend
Together we’re a force you can't apprehend
There ain't no set of rules that we will not bend
Bet you never thought we'd be back again
I said you are my best friend
When we grip the mic they start packing in
Spitting flows, ripping shows, don't ask us when
The next time that we'll ever be back again
