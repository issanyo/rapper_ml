[Vocals: Aesop Rock]
[Intro]
Shh... the baby is sleeping
A blind date with CNN
A click
Ouch
A click of beer man, that's the 10 year old
Motherfucking deep space evil nine milliemeter
White noise television
Fucking 3am
Gotta wonder if the roach was invented in my kitchen
Shut the fuck up
Don't wanna hear that shit
Backwards
With the volume up to keep it all out
WE
Na na na na
WE Don't ..

[Hook]
We don't like it when the city lights start fading
When the city lights fading then we can't get down (ok)
We don't like it when the city people act crooked
When the city people crooked then we can't get down (ok)
We don't like it when the city pigeons break wings
When the pigeons break wings then we can't get down (ok)
We don't like it when the city fire starts spreading
When the city fire's spreading then we can't get down (YO!)

[Verse]
Zook up in it, crook with a cord
With a cord with a two tonne gimmick
Deep space evil nine millimetre gimme
Damn needle point in this pin cushion family
Hot dam at the N.Y. resin
I soaked the bad air, the smoke we sold
Wild style, child’s smile like a moby cobra
Low key dozer revoked me ultra
Choked out bolts to promote the ulcer
Chug dro, bear hug wrote the folk lore
See the mangy branch off strange when he willow
Weep till the face go paisley
We don't wanna babble on the bad brains dum-dum brainiac bust out, girder, flushed out
Touched with a lush burn curdle in the dirt
Like it's bingo night at the earthworm church

- Bang-
Clash with the ants and termites
Ride ‘til the wheels fall off the dirt bike
Well I still hold dimes by the caseload
Hide the prescription, Miller said I’m stable
A R strike the pause
Put the flaws in a box with a … fuck off
Mallet for the media, mallet for the laws
Dragging a mallet through the city when he walks
Subliminal is so nineties, get wit it
Im more like bird watch then a mobster look
…
It goes dem’s good deeds
… stomach churning, round 2, quick, south of the sternum
What it is now, verse what it was, beat myself till the pain came up

Dork faced boy got apocalypse charm
With a yellowy grin, metal thin, metal limb
Metal kicks kiss metal bricks, kiss metal
Meddle with this: an anti bliss missile
Close to the fire when I bare skin lie
Leave me the idiot box I’m fine
But if I gotta see another roller skating parrot
On animal planet on a needle point eye
Eye to the needle, clean set of chompers
Made me a demo tape, mingle of the mobsters
Go ahead y'all flap y'all jaws
Aes stick with it 'til their face fall off

And the evilest of nine's guaranteed to shoot crooked
And the evilest of nine's guaranteed to shoot crooked
And the evilest of nine's guaranteed to shoot crooked
And the evilest of nine's guaranteed to shoot crooked

Off your fucking mind
Shoot crooked

[Hook]
We don't like it when the city lights start fading
When the city lights fading then we can't get down (ok)
We don't like it when the city people act crooked
When the city people crooked then we can't get down (ok)
We don't like it when the city pidgeons break wings
When the pidgeons break wings then we can't get down (ok)
We don't like it when the city fire starts spreading
When the fire's spreading then we can't get down

[Verse]
I met a girl with an angel face and two devil horns pokin out maybe with her brains replaced
She said walk to the store with her, ok
Bought a carton of squares, I think I fell in love today
Now whats a pretty little thing like you doing walking with a condor circle when the city lights fade
Dead walk only to redig the graves
And make it big enough to fit tv's and microwaves
Ooooh she didn't say shit (nup)
Smiles that could melt the gloss off your whip
And before I could ask her about her high wire, homegirl walked face first straight through the fire
Kill the pigs and poke the lump with a fork
If it all bleeds y’all need to shut the oven door
Here half worm dirt in the mouth
So its raining mud when the tongue lash out
Cool, beans, perfect, dope
Like Aes with a rafter and 6 feet of rope
Paradox spill out hate in all sections
You can get fucked when you standing at attention

And the evilest of nine's guaranteed to shoot crooked
And the evilest of nine's guaranteed to shoot crooked
And the evilest of nine's guaranteed to shoot crooked
And the evilest of nine's guaranteed to shoot crooked

Fix the fucking antenna

[Hook]
We don't like it when the city lights start fading
When the city lights fading then we can't get down (ok)
We don't like it when the city people act crooked
When the city people crooked then we can't get down (ok)
We don't like it when the city pigeons break wings
When the pigeons break wings then we can't get down (ok)
We don't like it when the city fire starts spreading
When the fire's spreading then we can't get down (ok)

[Outro]
No doubt
He ain’t, he ain’t got a gun in no shoebox
Face to the floor drop it
Still carry the evilest nine weapons
