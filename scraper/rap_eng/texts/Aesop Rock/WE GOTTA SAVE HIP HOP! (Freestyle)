[Verse]

We gotta save hip hop, rapping 'cause I won't stop
Hiding from the cops, you ain't never seen a body drop
Literate rhymesmith, who you really fucking with?
DoubleTripleMonolith, Guillotine Death Grips
Flow is so hot that I call it Lethal Lava Land
Mario 64, desolate wasteland
Motherfucker tripping like Alice in Wonderland
Clock is ticking, man, with the minute and the hour hand
Motherfuckers playing me, they say they in a rock band
Aggravating touch, like a child shooting rubber bands
Every time that I flow, bitches take the witness stand
Like I just killed a man, look it on the other hand
Lyrical master, magical caster
Cooking up the pasta, Crowley Alabaster
Dumbledore headmaster, sticking like plaster
Movie ticket master, weather forecaster
Goddamn, giant clams
(Bitch) I'm an Uncle Sam, David Beckham
Eat you like a roast lamb, wrestling body slam
Do you like Green Eggs and Ham? No, Sam-I-am!
Special K cereal, physical material
Vision like peripheral, dead like burial
Lawyer like trivial, super terriotorial
Spiritual, lyrical, miracle individual
Heavy like a big truck, humor like Donald Duck
Stupid like a big schmuck, leave the crowd awestruck
Brown like a woodchuck, school play, "Good luck!"
AC/DC, rocking like I'm Thunderstruck
Rattlesnake venomous, giving like generous
Vegetable asparagus, Snape like Severus
Identity anonymous, anti-feminist
Shot like Tetanus, mythical pegasus
