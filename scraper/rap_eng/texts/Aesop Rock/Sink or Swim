[Sample]
Seven years old and he's dying of old age!
And I don't give a fuck about any of you limp bizkit funny boys!

[Intro]
I was on some all in together
Whether whore, whether beggar
Whether rat or weathered leper
Come and cut this edge a second
We could build a better network
Without all the yes sir, yes sir

[Verse]
Post cannons up
Pull the pulse up outcha mans and what
Dick and Jane escape into the arcane where the phantoms fuck
Itchy skin he sits inside shifty village snitching
Grin and gargle when they argue happy
Are you happy? Sit and spin (sink or swim)
He kick his fins and wave his bony arms around
For guards who beg your pardon
While the arson burns your harvest down
What a darling town
What a snarling partridge farm
The bars are like a car with clowns
The parks are like a garbage barge
But still it was our parthenon
We part to train tomorrows argonauts and archers
With lungs that match their markers
Like army parkas marching
Through the marsh with buzzing sparklers
To carve apart the harpies
And disarm the budding marksmen
Are you charged up?
This be the trench foot kicking
Through the ten cook kitchen
Spoiled beef and chicken
We gobbled up the chemical in heaps, in new relief
Was thirty minutes past
The chalky tablets melting in our teeth
A dagger in the back became a fad to swagger jack
With additional maggots to lap the gashes aftermath
These are the crazers of the pinnacle nation
That'll steal the very bacon
Off your plate, thats so raven
Been jittery killer-the artillery parties
Lit up like symphony of pretty Ataris
Fitting the knitting needle splintered through the kewpie
Duke(?)
I speak in a dead language New York is hollerin' through me
Note the lazy foe be seven clicks outside the poppy fields
Telescopes and coffee spills
Folding chairs and orange peels
Peanut shells and all is fair
In loving brawlers crawling through the august air
That's the muggy handicap we all must share
And morning smells like blood worms
In the beaks of the very falcon
But how can arrested splendors
Of wretched sleep walk the palate
Palpating hearts like woe to you rascal eddy hazels
Which one of you bitches would flip the table?

[Outro]
Its gonna be a long night!
A real long night
