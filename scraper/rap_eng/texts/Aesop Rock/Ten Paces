[Verse]
Loaded burner, blade in a calf holster
Walkie talkie to communicate with the chauffeur
Map of the block to escape when it’s over
Looking like a killer, feeling like a soldier
The smell of perfume from having Tasha in my bed
Sticks to my fingertips and still lingers in the air
She told me about a hot spot named The Dragon’s Lair
Off a backstreet up out by the state fair
She guarantee me every Sunday they be there
Playing pool and sniffing coke up until the AM
She met 'em both back when she used to bartend
But said they'd be hard to touch cause the gang that they roll with
No fear, ice is flowing through my veins
Surveyed the spot last night and it’s all arranged
I know where they hang plus where they lay their heads
They can confess to what they did or they can end up dead
Had to drop me off three blocks from the spot
Then park across the street in an open lot
Put on my gas mask and took the alley just to creep up
Black trench coat looking like the grim reaper
Black assassin waiting for 'em after dark inside of a dumpster
Twenty feet from where they park
Quiet as a church mouse, silent as a beating heart
Then the fat one stumbled out with a fat blunt to spark
I knew the owner didn’t let them smoke in the bar
So they usually walked out to the dumpster way behind their cars
He took a couple pulls and blasted off to outer space
Pulled out my pepper spray and caught him right in his face
Hopped out, he started screaming, punched him in his jaw
The force from the punch made him bite down on his tongue
"How it feel, fat boy? Now you all alone!
Remember me?" pushed him to the ground and kicked his balls
He tearing up like "oh shit, I thought you was dead!"
"Naw man you and your mans killed the wrong kid
I could kill you now for the sake of revenge
Or you can come with me and tell the cops what you did"
Heard footsteps, turned around, they’re coming fast
Two white t-shirts, two big dudes with red rags
Side-stepped the first one but slipped on some broken glass
The second one caught me hard enough that it cracked my mask
Fell back a little dazed but knew he broke his hand
Acted hurt but pepper sprayed him when he circled in
First cat back now, he’s swinging that wild
Duck stuck my life into his stomach, made him take a bow
Three dudes laid down, back to the fat one
He spit in my face he say "fuck you, I ain’t doing nothing!"
I put my blade to his neck and started slowly cutting
Heard a shotgun pump then I heard it start dumping
Moved just in time, the shot hit the fat dude
Blew the face right off the skull it was attached to
He pumped again I could see the short motherfucker
Second shot blow a hole right through that old dumpster
Can’t hide much longer gotta make a break
Buck shots from a third shot almost hit my face
I saw lights from a car pulling in the strip
Thinking it’s a cop car, I take it as my chance to dip
Fourth shot hit the window of somebody's whip
I’m hauling ass fast as possible until I slip
He got the drop on me, but I still pull my nine
His body drop but I swear that shot wasn’t mine
