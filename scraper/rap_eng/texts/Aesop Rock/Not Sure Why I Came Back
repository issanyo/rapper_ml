Still not sure why I came back
Didn't feel a thing, just heard the "crack"
Fell forward, then somebody hopped up on my back
Shook 'em off my right side, then I heard an evil laugh
They're not fuckin around, pretty sure my wig is split
Turned around and seen 'em with the bottle that they hit me with
That was the fat one, the other one was half his size
Running at me full steam, fire burning in his eyes
Not a fan of fighting, two on one is never wise
But I'm only here because I overheard that woman's cries
Seen her legs hanging out from behind the dumpster
Interrupted when it was the fat one's time to fuck her
Caught a left, but didn't feel it through my gas mask
Reached for my blade, arm blocked by my own bag
That's when he caught me with the bottle, broke on impact
Glad it broke, cause if it didn't, probably would have been a wrap
Backpeddle for a second, try to clear my head
Caught a break when he telegraphed his right hand
I'm way taller so I slip it just by leaning back
Threw a kick at his knee, overheard the joint snap
Wanted to stomp him out no sooner than he hit the ground
But his boy was running at me, yelling with his pants down
Still kicked him in his face right when he arrived
Saw the woman running out the corner of my eye
This ain't supposed to happen on the night before christmas
He hesitated when he heard the sirens in the distance
I caught him slipping when he reached down to grab his pants
Swung my blade at his, but only caught him in his hand
