[Verse 1]
I was a dark, dumb student, no hooky rookie
Day tripping on visions of chickens that look like R. Crumb drew em
They grew em in a royal dirt of Suffolk County's
Flooring with the blood of an alcoholic clergyman in his forearms
Long Island was porn stars and puppies pushing sniffles
Fit into the aforementioned or slipped through the pinholes
Zook slipped through the pinholes
Crispy the God sender
Who thunk over a quarter plunk to local Mortal Kom vender
Both the formal squad censor, look down
Either side across the marsh before it was awesome cars
My calling card cavalry cooking an '85 Dodge Ares
Gas for Huntington and back barely
Equipped with Super-Soakers full of piss
And an uncanny knack for constantly upsetting pigs by doing stupid shit
The kid piloted his ring king dummies to King Kullen
Where he hollered fuck the world from a parking lot in the suburbs
What's this
A couple spray cans and a little litter
But they'd look at us like swindlers with them Ricky Kasso jitters
So fuck em, a glutton sunk into the alley for props
But things will still go bump when them halogens pop
Believe I'll be there when it happens
The shaking of the plates off the mantle
The snaking of the flames off the candle
The lady of the lake off the answers
Admitting the mistakes to their deplaning cadavers
Now it's rest in peace Will Peterson whose heater sung disturbingly to
Further re-evaluate your beast of burden's urgency
Damn doggy, good times, thanks
I wrote your name in wet cement by the Brooklyn Banks
What's this

[Refrain]
I'm an activator
Made a fire, made a wheel, made a snack for later
Catacomb kids cuddle up and test the flavor
When the towns speed freaks sleep
Trap the traitor, he will ask for papers
What's this
Say I'm an activator
Made a roof, made a weapon, made a flag per acre
By the snotty little muzzle of a latch-key neighbor
When the folk push aggie over some dap with gators
He will catch the vapors

[Verse 2]
Couple Playboy mudflaps and hell on his heels
Beautifully echoed in the pace at which he shovel his meals
Like not a farmer among us had a harvest survive the winter
So dinner split a lima bean in triplets, pick a winner
Took a couple summers puking pills behind the dumpster
As the largest Pez dispenser on record recouped his numbers
One shoe in the soupy gutter
One shoe in the velvet heaven
Where the mermaids told him shake em by the lake of melted weapons
What's this
You could dance purty with the hooligan nation
Who will be patiently awaiting zoo-keeper facelift
Extra the days of yore painted similar uber-ape shit
We've merely updated the ancient 8-bit
Yeah I'm dumber than a cow on a roof in a flood
Who's not as dumb as the watered-down beef from the burgers that jumped
I'm dumber than a Taz on a beach chair with a martini
Who's not as dumb as the tat wit the same scenery
What's this
Sparky nails pig stigmata for all good sport
Garbage pail kids unite at the mall food court
They chase cheese fries with Binaca
They had shut the school down early
There were bombs inside the lockers
No concept of the problem
We responded like a snow day
It was clobber shit to flotsam
Til the cops said it was okay
Okay show the squadrons back into their boxes
Like his Breakfast Club of hotheads show no progress to the doctors
And I walk into the office, coughing awful ether often
Flood a parking meter fever, knuckle up for Love and Rockets
It was reign of the razor laser
Day of the cloudy howdy
Flight of the shelter melter
You can bow without me
What's this

[Refrain]

Watch me jump
What's this
Knock em out the box, Aes
