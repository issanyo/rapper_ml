[Verse 1: Allyson Baker]
Party's over the season
Waited out 'til I'm seeing alright
Left to go home for the weekend
Made plans not wanting to stay
Danger no longer
Lost time been wasted away
Knew you've nothing to offer
Leave me in 'til I'm feeling alright

[Chorus]
Maybe I made a mistake
Not that I would've stayed
I shout it into his soul
A one-way run way home
Where we go
Where we go

[Verse 2: Allyson Baker]
Consensus is I'm a drifter
If I could I would visit today
Had to longer run before
Can't wait, come show me your face
Cause of what happened Monday
I just want a ticket to go
Afraid of seeing the end fire
Leave me in 'til I knock on the door

[Chorus]
Maybe I made a mistake
Not that I would've stayed
I shout it into his soul
A one-way run way home
Where we go
Where we go
A one-way run
Where we go
Where we go

[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]
Got his x-rays back: heart shaped like a hedge maze
Neck brace, break-neck pace through the red tape
Bass-head, purple tape circling dead space
Predatory birds on a perforated rib-cage
Checkmate, never be the “stood upon a soap-box”
Sat upon a milk crate, butchering a pro-cop
Poof!
Big face cloaked in a smoke bomb
Last seen looking for a home to impose on
Off-day, walking to Rome
With his head hung lower than a dog with a cone
Barely a cog in a wheel on the road
To a large ordeal in a field with a moat, still...

[Outro: Allyson Baker]
I put my feet on the ground, step over the fire
Both feet on the floor, I walk, walk in the sleep
I put my feet on the ground, step over your body
Try to feel for the door, walk, walk in the sleep
I put my feet on the ground, step over the fire
Both feet on the floor, I walk, walk in the sleep
I put my feet on the ground, step over your body
Try to feel for the door, walk, walk in the sleep
