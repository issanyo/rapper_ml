Hola...!
Let's go ya'll

One for the money
What up?
What's good in the galley?
This one for the ghosts
Sniffin glue in the alley
I bounce with a set a sims
Equipped with a foul jowl moment
Waitin for that great celebrity towel throw-in
(Now) Aes trane invasive species how to bleed stones
Cold Ol' Yeller
Rogue shelter melter
Drag a leech pelt caper to rubble he call home
Then leap out of Gattaca to cuddle and brawl bowed
Or should he crawl wrong to brawny ogres of Weatherville?
Little Billy Spillaguti
Hopped up on that debt of bills
One man walkin' through a world of mother fuckers
Like one Ben Hawkins in a world of Brother Justins
Bust the Hellcat on a Hot
Tin, or rock a sars mask
And limp their red carpet
To cough in a pop star's hands
When the troublesome bubblegum muse occasion ekes itself
The meek, in admirably, evacuate his arm span
Tarzan of Long Island savaged to feed the fam (Fam)
Who stuff candles alongside scavengers of the damned (Damned)
Stubble waste and insects
Orphaned to crooked portions
When looked at it
In comparison to the fortunes and boredom
Who pussy for the dollar?
Fuck it
Whore 'em
And I label that
Now my sheep is a shepherd's table scrap
Play with that
Sailors knot
Wine for his limbs
Plus a cane and hat
Shake it for the same critics
Who later will fillet the fact
Yeah, my up-jump's the boogie
You'll jump start the noogie-wagon
Loogie
Up jumps the jukie (Jukie)
Cold (cold)
Get retarded
And bother you
Till you buy my shit
Like Smiley to Mookie
Aesop-rickety-Rock
He up and walked off
Showed 'em how the zeitgeists walk dogs
Showed 'em how to
Dodge boss hogs when the markers are gripped
Screamin, "Damn!  I'm gettin to old for this shit!"
Sip one
We kill 'em with cuts and no alibi
Fly shit
Raised in the heart of NY shit
This is not your over-the-counter rap
More like over the counter
Into the Klonopin and back
Overhaul that!
Keep shit crispy!
Keep using your fifteen minutes to diss me
I love it
Thanks
One sec' left
Have a nice life
Good night
God bless
