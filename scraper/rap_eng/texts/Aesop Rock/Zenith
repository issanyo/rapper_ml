[Spoken Word]
He met a strange creature who's eyes flamed in the night
They all were very kind, but they could not show the way until..

[Verse 1]
Time to body this
The physical embodiment of highly concentrated matter forged out from a title-less source. Deem it vital if your life's the reward
A knife to a swords' comparable but only when war is commenced
So Never bother how I fashioned this trench
A fascist's extreme passion seems un-nationalist when
It's broken down and examined via a factual lens
I'd rather run out of rations than be casual friends with my ex
When 'the next up' gets sad it's a travesty
The generality of the causes is often addle things
Up and at em'. Rattled the hive who hides naturally
Then add up every second and apply it to your faculty
Climbing up the ladder to Saturn to get away from this
Shape-shift to something more useful like spaceship
My makeshift prototype failed upon testing
So I'm guessing that my formulas off
Gestalt templates explain my perception got me taking steps backwards
This caveat presented makes it clear that if my last words antecede
Any implication I apologize if it has worried you
Matter fact, I've been known to lie
My mask is well equipped with a wide range of faces
To show of any mood that is the opposite or blatant of yours
Sure, the mental maladies have been receded
Though it hasn't been the same since I've departed from the seams (so it seems)
Life is but a cutthroat paradox
People find it fit to slit your gullet for a pair of socks
To keep them warm while walking in the cold for their benefit
To make their journey easier for reasons they consent to this
I like to dream that I'm out in the cosmos natant
Taking in the glowing stars in which I come across while laying
As the sun sits and radiates it's light for it fuel me
I'll be cooling on the moon while rocking planets as my jewelry
Uh
The all expansive has been dancing on his lonesome
And attempts to be a scholar while stressing over his loans
It's never going to end and I'm never going to know
What's ever going to be to this planet I call home
Because by about that time I'll be buried
100 feet underground in an undisclosed elementary
Then the "who/what" query's relating to my existence
Can be answered through the scriptures that I've hidden in the bricks
Of the house that built that where I go to reflect
On my many ideas or my possible regrets
My apostles neglect the fact that I am no better
Than the letter after X followed by O U. So true
The Son A rhyme book exegesis either leaves the readers sleepy
Or completely without feeling or dreams
At times I get so nervous I scream
Internally cos eternitys' a burden to me

[Spoken Word]
Do you know where Wonderland is?
It is the place you visit in your dreams
The strange and wondrous place where nothing is as it seems
It was in Wonderland where he was all by his lonely self

[Verse 2]
Ex-angel facsimile
On the way down you better think of me
When I had hit bottom said "never thought I would sink this deep"
I have been where you are and bought property for visiting
Hospitality is a given. I'm like the giving tree
Limitings ferocious in regards to my approach
Of coping with the day in-day out work awaiting the results
Yeah they must be high or low. I kept my finger on the pulse
To see that if my wills' alive or not to finalize my goals
So stand up if this track is tantamount to your condition
And if it isn't I'm sorry for tawdry rhyming when spitting
If feeling different on how my manner is too expressive
I'm sorry but all that matters is untangling my head
Call it selfish if you want but understand just why I do this:
To demonstrate incoming inspirations via music
That's it
I have reached the zenith and I never plan to stop
