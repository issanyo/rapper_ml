I don't need a reason to rebel
I sneak into the club I ain't leaving without a pelt
For the people feeling need to sleep i leaguered at the helm
Tryna' ease up out the nucleus and bleed into the hills
I'm a, old seed dog sippin' on fizz
My olk still put skate stickers on the fridge
Ate dinner at the Denny's with a dumbed out coven
And a company of uninvited blood hounds huffin'
Tough crowd, eat and chew the crud king, aw crud
I'm day one and two and one thing
None drum up any drama for the huffy
I ain't even lift the glove up out the pockets of the puffy
Once
