[Intro: Sample]
What's this?
A note from the school nurse?
Oh my gosh! Head lice in your classroom?

[Verse 1: Aesop Rock]
Paranoia voyeur awake in the haunted crawl space
Hoodie up, gaunt face down, taut draw strings
Sprawl over the cookie cut, a mutt of all things
All mange, all dogs of war evolve strange
Nose in the feed trough, curds in his coffee
Tend to his cough and uncontrollable frothing
Spawn of the awful, play the wall softly, hunt alone
Hum his own swan song off-key

[Verse 2: Homeboy Sandman]
Mysterious malady, I put all my effort towards
Symptoms oddly absent from the message boards
Someone made a snide remark on Noah’s ark
I did not complain
Three bottles clanging, I was singing in the rain
What do you get for the man who has everything?
More of it, I’m sure of it
Soon as I’m finished snoring then I’ll show you where I’m storing it
Forsaken good for goodness sake
And wish I lived in nature so that I could throw my cell phone in the lake

[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]
Hate himself like a snake with two heads
The new flesh-eater co, eat a whole food web
Spoon fed stupefying death to a zoom lens
Definitely never leave a neck where the noose ends
Ever, follow what the rap hands pantomime
Slit throats, hang men, and bellyachers atomized
Jam at the party with the vamps and the carnies
He the upper hand, one man skeleton army

[Verse 4: Homeboy Sandman]
Primordial, audio
From sitting at the Casio
And cracking open an empty pistachio
Pardon odors but I’m always on my job
I don’t throw no boxers out until they’re completely dissolved
After all’s been said
I eat myself alive to see me eaten not to see myself fed
I’m apathetic till these goods could get fenced
And not offended how I’m better off dead
Yet…

[Verse 5: Aesop Rock, Aesop Rock & Homeboy Sandman]
Lightning struck that man two times
Brushed off his coat that man’s too alive
Slack jaw, chew a face off no bath salts
No crabs only fatten’d up pack wolves
Tracking, cro-mags batten down hatches
Not a sap, not a scratch on the crash test
Ashes to ashes, catch the odd sonnet
What more can I say, Top Ramen

[Verse 6: Homeboy Sandman:]
What’s the point of keeping points, we’re playing different games
I revel in my solitaire without a care
Smiling and nodding when I’m not aware
Or waving off a belch
Where I’m parading operating on myself
Playing a game a chance to top the candor where the cameras never peek
Come around and take a gander at the gambler on a streak
Any contact with a contract I was signing off in crayon
Will anybody please accept me as I am?
