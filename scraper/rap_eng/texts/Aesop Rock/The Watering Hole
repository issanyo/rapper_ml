Inside of a smoke filled, no frills, watering hole
An old man kicks the jukebox, stubbing his toe
The bartender glances up with a stare so cold
And tells the man that "if you do that shit again you can go"
It's either too loud or no sound, torn up or broke down
Everything's extreme, Sped up or slowed down
Gang signs and call girls, soft white and crack sales
For business men the model is "don't ask don't tell"
I'm a creature of the night so i been here before
Ordered a drink to try to swallow what i saw at the store
A petty criminal was shot, put down like a dog
But I still can't find the killers I'm looking for
Despite the fact that I've been on the hunt every day
I'm starting to fell the situation slowly slipping away
For what I did, another innocent kid had to pay
But I'mma make it right and not let those punks get away
I'm at a dark booth scraping paint from off my mask
Using a blade that I usually kept inside of my bag
In my own world until I heard the sound of a glass hit the floor full of beer and the customers laugh
By the volume of the sound I could tell it was close
Beer splashed on my eyelash and all on my coat
Lift my eyes and see the chick who's glass just broke
She staring at me all shook like she just saw a ghost
Reached back for my knife, asked if there's a problem
She grabbed my hand and said "no" in a tone that was calming
Her body was bad, accent was foreign
Her name was Tasha, sat down then started talking
She said, "you don't know me, but I know who you are
From that night I got attacked and escaped with this scar
I got some information that you might be interested in
The two kids that tried to rape me and killed that kid."
