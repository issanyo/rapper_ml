I run run rappers right out of the game
Bitch em, sit em down in the hall of shame
Young somethin, lil bitch all of the names
I usually keep it quiet cuz hatin is so lame
But every now and then you gotta state the facts
Like 98% of these dudes is straight wack
They got me up in center space and im dancin to techno
Bumpin indie rock, dim mak, electro
I got a brand new car, full tank of gas
I got a big mansion, and its made of glass
My momma always told me better make that cash
So thats what i do while i wait to crash
I got a brand new car, full tank of gas

Wait wait(yeah) i hear you caught a couple of breaks
You still a sucker trying to catch airwaves
Catch a fall down a stair case, take it
Another unmarked grave under the basement
Up on the stage its like
Something to taste its like
Runnin the place its like
Punchin your face its like
Dont attempt to follow nothing to chase
Or you might see the bottom of one of those lakes
Fakes, frauds, and phonies, are we like the only
Mother fuckers in this game that ain't corny
My little pony ass rappers with a stylus
Trying to be rainbow bright on some fly shit
Strawberry shortcake doing to much
They focus on the fasion the music sucks
You look like a pinchy pi√±ata pendejo
Make like a carpet, roll up or lay low
I got a brand new car, full tank of gas
I got a big mansion, and its made of glass
My momma always told me better make that cash
So thats what i do while i wait to crash

I used to drink 40's on the porch all the time
Now im gettin older and im sippin that wine
Pino no fuckin merlot
I used to pack a pocket knife inside my yellow
Got stabbed in third grade by the swings
Since then i keep a switchblade inside my jeans
Fuck with me and ill cut ya, straight king tut ya
Wrap you up in bandages mother fucker
Set the monster free
They never used to talk to me
Now they holler at me constantly
Well hop on these, take the properties
And multiply that shit by the power of 3
Didn't you know, we still in control
Its felt mother fucker, all systems go
You been to my show, its like a mistletoe
So hold the bottle and play spin the globe
I got a brand new car, full tank of gas
I got a big mansion, and its made of glass
My momma always told me better make that cash
So thats what i do while i wait to crash
I got a brand new car, full tank of gas

Huh, i guess the moral is, stick a fork in it
We got more to give, your fortunate
You fuckin with a legend and these members of the orphanage
Orgamisms that were born for this
First we make the people feel quite right
And then im workin on a sequel, the zeitgiest
So push up the light, peace, nighty night
Stay tuned, felt number 4, tribute to heidi fleiss
