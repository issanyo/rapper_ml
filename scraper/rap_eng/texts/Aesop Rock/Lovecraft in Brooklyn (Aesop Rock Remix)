[Verse 1: John Darnielle]
It's gonna be too hot to breathe today
But everybody is out here on the streets
Somebody's opened up the fire hydrant
Cold water rushing out in sheets
Some kid in a Marcus Allen jersey
Asks me for a cigarette
Companionship is where you find it
So I take what I can get
Hubcaps on the car like fun house mirrors
Stick to the shadows when I can
Lovecraft in Brooklyn

[Verse 2: John Darnielle]
When the sun goes down the armies of the voiceless
Several hundred-thousand strong
Come out without their bandages
Their voices raised in song
When the street lights sputter out
They make this awful sizzling sound
I cast my gaze towards the pavement
Too many blood stains on the ground
Rhode Island drops into the ocean
No place to call home anymore
Lovecraft in Brooklyn

[Bridge: John Darnielle]
Head outside most everyday to try to keep the wolves away
Imagine nice things I might say
If company should come

[Verse 3: John Darnielle]
Woke up afraid of my own shadow
Like, genuinely afraid
Headed for the pawnshop
To buy myself a switchblade
Someday something's coming
From way out beyond the stars
To kill us while we stand here
It'll store our brains in mason jars
And then the girl behind the counter
She asks me how I feel today
I feel like Lovecraft in Brooklyn

[Verse 4: Aesop Rock]
Before the BQE & FDR, HP, on the MTA
Wanted with his whole pink heart to honor and befriend BK
Unbeknownst to all he'd soon defend each blessed breath he takes
For now he scrape his meat hooks on the reddest parts and penetrate
Summer lovin' snuck him toward the tarnished arms of liberty
Love is tough as muffin splits, grown-ups play the dozens best
Clap, Kings County feeded shrapnel to the saplings
From under canopy of attack and leathery bat wings
Two of every animal; crawl out anything tangible
Dance with evils guaranteed to spin your parents' parasols
Little Howie's parachute has flowered down the rabbit hole
No trespassing, violators get your tarots pulled
