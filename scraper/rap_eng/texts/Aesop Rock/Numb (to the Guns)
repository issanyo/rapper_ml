What'd I miss?
900 cc's of the raw in one fist
The bum's dumb blitz
Order in the court where the mortars jump bricks
Everybody, lung on the table, this point counterpoint
Aesop has the murkiest, yet he numb out the prowler oint (uh)
And after bubblegum, he sink into the sofa
Clicker to pilot his broadcasted choice of cobra (hissssss)
The venom remains the same game of stale toxins
Camo'd with the now ornamental satellite options
Whatever's good I got this grave half dug (true)
But Yani covering taps to make the pain worse than it was (nooo)
Playin marbles (playin marbles)
Hit by a bus (hit by a bus)
Death is sweet (death is sweet)
Hell sucks, sucker
Damien probably wishin I'd donate a fuck
But this shit's chiller than any conversation I've had in months
The iron fang drew 'em all loopy (real loopy)
So when he extended the hand the planet's Kujo's went Snoopy
In perfect synocaption, burnt to crispy critters
Like synchronized swimmers in boric rivers
Mmmm, poor soaked critters
Lick chop dig-in, who dares lick a shot at pigeons?
Why I oughta (Vast get em!)
He surfs city circuits for the power and the glory
To the cowards in the quarry you will always blink before me
Its Doc Roc full-effect, campfire stories
Like I "Threw Your Momma From the Train" to try to front on "Porkies"
He finds the garbage more inspiring than the good stuff (right)
His ink sleeps while the military look tough
Look, im sorry, crooked priority list
But Mr. USA-up-all-night's blackened heart already skips
I'm 'bout to crash this bitch to hibernate
Tell Wolf Blitzer holler at his boy when he hosts "Blind Date"
It goes spit on CNN and force the war back through the cable box
Where M1's are like stage props aimed at latest names dropped
So now he ignorant, right? (right)
No, he just accepts the inevitable apocalyptic syllabus
Sing along, Zooka dies of chemical poison, and watch 'em
Bring it on
Dag nabbit, that cat's faster
I dead opinions and swap it out for the urges
Of a serpent tryin to stuff it in the jam before the curtains

He's numb to the guns, thanks to the tank cams
Glued to the box like the opposites will shake hands
Enough hell for the world's hand baskets
Enough cells for the world's hand captured
Numb to the guns, now he touch buttons that'll re-route imagery
Yes dawg, he recognize the history
Yes dawg, he recognize the misery
But switch for element of surprise and demise

From m-16's or disco and hula-hoops
Murder the fads before the fads murder you and yours
Me and mine find T&A on TNT
Pleasin' to the iris more than TNT on DNA
Morbid but important, I know, stop
Mork porked Mindy in this episode, watch
POW be buzzin by the rumbling cannons and less amateurs, bystander analyst
Went through the "Holy fuckin' shit I'm gonna die" phase
Now it's "Well, I'm gonna die, let's get this barn's sides raised"
So when they ask what's your opinion on the war?
I tell 'em "War sucks donkey dick. What's the Knicks' score?"
Maybe it's his allergies, no horns and pitchforks (umm, umm)
Dusk muskrat (uhmm) eleven tusk jab (uhmm)
Elegant bloodbath, leggin it, egg 'em on
Television preg-a-nant and medicine is born
Get a mean doubt, community duel glazed over blank white sockets
Lookin for a heavy seven richter to shiver the crocs right up out they options
Novacaine, bloodwork, spoon though the Lochness
Hostage, no shame, suck the fear out his muck
So when the nozzles hit his nostrils
He don't give a fuck
After all, it's just like on TV around the clock
The thorns are real and anger management is not

He's numb to the guns, thanks to the tank cams
Glued to the box like the opposites will shake hands
Enough hell for the world's hand baskets
Enough cells for the world's hand captured
Numb to the guns, now he touch buttons that'll re-route imagery
Yes dawg, he recognize the history
Yes dawg, he recognize the misery
But switch for element of surprise and demise
