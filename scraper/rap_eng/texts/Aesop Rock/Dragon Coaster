A swamped rat in the labyrinth huntin' derriere
Skeletal vessel crafts where the liquid meets the prairie (right!)
Limp a long, spill it, his speech is bumped into infantry
Simply smiled about it and ran victory
My tenant blanket the banquet
A thank and a jacket
I sank into my prayers
Let the steam roll of the lip of the kettle
My flying-contraption drips in a bucket
A bum drunk with nine planets that circle planning
And won't even share a cup with the Sun
The flow commits ablaze harassment of my entrapment fragments
Opened up all ears leads towards mild display adaption
I'm old, the creak of a rusted hinge notified every market place common apart the dust pan
That are roped in a slogan picket but can't finger their motives (right)
Surgeons work their shifts with queued suits broke in the motion (right)
Storytelling casualties is magic on a rotten day
"But we already know the one about the fish that got away"
Man, I walk a bridge with tin cans, with both my flags within hands
Barnished and tarnished skeletal frames sentinel devil tin man
Cannibal taught me about an iron galaxy where I sleep
Yeah but I'm trying to find that if my tin-figure is special or obsolete
I dash with dreams with an attraction to the captions at the bottom
"Here lies a tailor made slate obstacle"
I can feel the remnants of your devilish smiled offered a slay
But I'd rather play the Sun and let it fade
