Yeah
Watch
(It's) The world's greatest thing ever thung
(It's) The saccharine that the sit on your tongue
Fill up his clip-on tie repellant
Squeegee to semi-developed
While you were sleepin' he's building Rome in his cellar
I'm too alive right now
The view to which you subscribe
Find the key to parry blockage of the cubicle (?)
I had a plate of half cooked matters looking at me stupid
Fed 'em to the hogs that waddle between the bookends
Look, clear!
All I gotta do is:
Simply make the greatest masterpiece ever conceived by human students
Once I am convinced that the kismet inside the labor
Is already incredible I might as well ink the paper
Hell yes!
Easy-peasy, right?
Sure. Hey, whatever makes the hazel glaze well
I sink teeth deep in to the chart with a fang but for a hark
'cuz even silly pink bunnies look scary in the dark!
Bang on pots and pans, ring alarm swiftly
Cue to bugle turbulent, who salute the worker ant?
Duke up to the firmament, overthrow the vapors
With a fail-safe method composed by your nosy neighbors
Like this:

Smack dab in the middle of his palms
Had a new day victory, ready to evolve
Who will celebrate and sleep on the couch
To later wake up in the second best seat in the house

(It's) The world's greatest thing ever thung
Except the last digit, pink in your lung
What a genius plan, of on a marvel of engineering to rival the great pyramids and cheese in a can
He's in a band called "Birds" and it work ?
With a root down deeper than the pockets on his doctors
So selfishly melt through the piss of Hades
As to never note the critics, shake the hands or kiss the babies
So the ratings through the chapel roof
And snaggle-tooth is focused outside of the jurisdiction of failure among the motives
Just when the victory is comfortably assumed
You will be woken by the creaky hinge of door number two
Door number two, it's sorta like a silhouetted whore in plain view
When your homework is due
Rhinestone cowboy, nursing his little phenom
As an even newer idea poke its head out for recon
Oh what a weird distraction, all of a sudden you're lugging separate chapters
Original mission is bliss and all
But this admittedly is somewhat attractive, even if a little backwards

Smack dab in the middle of his palms
Had a new day victory, ready to evolve
Who will celebrate and sleep on the couch
To later wake up in the second best seat in the house

(It's) The world's greatest thing ever thung
On second thought, check back when I'm done
Just for fun, I know I saw them troubleshooting, and you were so focused
Cloaked over the mulish buoyancy in the the dosage
So roguish, gloating over the merit and majesty in the moment you chose to own wholeness
So bogus the coach is doubting his outing
Now the same cellar is littered with Rome's homeless
Bang
Style of that new sensation seems jealous when it notices the stake's location
Brains for a second starts hollerin' ultimatums like, "Your last chicken trippin' on some..."
Save it, pick a favorite
New car smell, walk like a star, ? my currents at the bar
Contradicts every jewel I drop, my apologies but what did y'all expect, school sucks
Put a bow on this one, rinse and repeat it
So tomorrow I'll actually be my zenith achievement
To my heart-of-gold medics with aesthetics on a string
You will forever be employed by the next best thing

Smack dab in the middle of his palms
Had a new day victory, ready to evolve
Who will celebrate and sleep on the couch
To later wake up in the second best seat in the house
