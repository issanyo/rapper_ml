[Verse One] [PackFM]:
I don't rhyme without reason, don't get it distorted
Cause as soon as it's worded, I get it recorded
Mastered, wrapped in plastic and shipped to the stores
Where it's bought, it was sent because to shift your thoughts
To the form of reports and the former report
Potent as Formula 44 poured through your pores
I breathe life into the sport like a savior of sorts
It's all in a days labor so save your applause

[Mecca]:
It ain't about accolades so save the awards
? told me the baby is yours
I've been trying to raise it right while raising the bar
Stayin' on tour while beats play in the car
In the cold world we dress warm, takin' no shorts
Tryin' to turn cipher "Ohs" into stadium roars
Either way it's all gravy of course
I can't ? ? ?

[Substantial]:
That's IF the little kids do they chorus
US we study abroad
So world wide girls, rise with some snores
Stan chills with a fam to support
You'll coach, I'll play the court
Givin' English Muffin's American pork
You get buried in scores
Your high marks already been caught
I married sick y'all already divorced
Dominion, JS-1 endorse, Rock Steady enforce
Nobody cares about the size of the loss

[Scratch Chorus]:
"Bring it on boy I love it"
"Verbal Assault" - Inspectah Deck 'Tru Master'
"Don't get mad if I scare you" - C-Rayz Walz
"Many styles I've mastered" - Nas
"Rappers be takin' notes" - Redman '4,3,2,1'
"I forever puttin' words together" - Common 'Chi-City'

[Verse Two] [Mecca]:
Took ours when the doubters wouldn't give us our props
Now to show our gratitude here's a dick in a box
Tend our own bar since they wouldn't give us our shot
We ain't underrated drinkers just underrated thinkers
For a decade, men but they not
MCs
All for the love of hip hop
We seize
Concert halls, night clubs and lounges
And you and your sweat cycle fit well rounded

[PackFM]:
I don't know what kinda 'yac these other rappers sippin'
But Dominion's on the track so sit back and listen
They tried to crack the last pot we had to piss in
With the planet on our shoulder you'd think something had to give in
Against all odds we just scratched the last ticket
And hit the jackpot even with a digit missin'
There's been no intermission since then
Without division or a loose linchpin
So clear the way we can play

[Substantial]:
You got Brooklyn's finest
Q.U.'s livest
Baltimore's righteous
The line starts behind us
Front line the fight, don't need GPS to find us
Your style in defeat
We undefeated sky writers
Dominion stay above you like we headline fliers
Superbowl champs, you water boys and side liners
Need packs like Pied Pipers
So take a shot and turn try to snipe us
Kick like a class of Muay Thai fighters
