[Intro]
Welcome to DJ Deckstream Airlines
I’m your pilot for this journey
I go by the name Substantial
Enjoy the ride (QN5)

[Verse 1]
When I get a pen you can set sail
And ride with the wind I’ll take you there
Now vibe with me friend losing ain’t an option
I came to win and provide for my kin
I shine like a gem, polished to perfection
Counting my blessings for hours I’ve been…
Trying to bend…time with a rhyme
As fine as the skin on my new born daughter
Hotter than a kettle they lukewarm water
The Plague’s airborne who’s flyer than them
I’ve come here to put a little light where it’s dim
With punch lines catching suckers right on the chin
Who take it higher than him? No one!
Sensai Sub part-time shogun
One with it like I sprout mics from my limbs
To do it how I do it just might be a sin

[Hook]
We can take flight in the sky
And see the world… with our own eyes
Open your mind, I’ll take you higher
We can fly away where ever you desire

[Verse 2]
Thank you for flying with Deck & Sub
Wanna go higher we’ll take you up
You ain’t gotta wish just grab you a star
As we scrape skies and travel abroad
Preparing the raw for die-hard fans
Press records so hot they’ll fry your hands
I’m your man bringing soul to the Hip-Hop
Environment… Why so bland?
Do this and represent my whole fam
Rhymes hard-body like Iron Man
I’m so damn…cool like a breeze on a
Tropical beach as you lie on sand
Trying to tan. Won’t stop ‘til my haters scream
I’m a fan! Wise up fam!
Why resist? Come ride with Stan!
Get props from J-land to Kazakhstan

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Higher, Lets take it higher, can we go
Higher, Elevate higher, People aim
Higher, Lets take it higher, can we go
Higher, Elevate higher, People aim

[Verse 3]
Higher… clouds will cushion our fall
Sick with the words so you’re looking to call…
On me…‘Cause what I spit is superb
On a higher level, we fishing for birds
Finishing first like only a pro could
Dress funky fresh man I stink so good
I’m so hood, but my rhymes are proper
Might go wood but there are none hotter
Substantial my name is a mouthful
Flying you away from the lame and the awful
Songs on the air this too shall past
Let’s take flight baby move your ass!

[Hook x2]
