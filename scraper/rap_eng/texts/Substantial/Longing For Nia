[Verse 1:]
When I was little I had plenty of dreams
But football & art stayed at the top it seemed
The peak before I reached mine still doubt I have yet
Studied greats, took notes like I’m stealing tablets
Placid. Hadn’t a clue of why I was here
Long as fun exceeded the total amount of my tears
Years pass and peers flag my dreams with jeers
And soon my vulnerable mind appeared to be drowning in fears
Plus I was broken up physically
But what really stopped me was they got to me mentally
To be or not to be is my quandary, picture me
Smoking opposition like Barbeque, Hickory
Flawless victory what would you have done
Should’ve been a track star all I could do is run
Done playing on the field but still playing the field of dreams
But football star no longer seemed real to me

[Hook:]
Real or not I want it
And once I got it
You know I gots to flaunt it for all
If it’s there I’m coming
Hundred miles and running
With the world on my shoulders to haul
Down a lonely road, trying to find my purpose
No telling what I’ll see
Low and behold, after all my searching
I found out its up to me

[Verse 2:]
Still ain’t sure what I’m here for
‘Cause sports faded from the plan in my mid teens
Though art was still apart of the scheme I’m writing rhymes, part time
Trying to hop on the scene I won’t be ignored
Wasn’t hard to make green creativity
And drive made my hustling keen, couldn’t stop me
I was just spreadin my wings, trying to live out my dreams
Wanted to live like Akeem and King Jaffe
Raps on point but my grade’s obscene
Momma saying I should join the marines I mean the army
She think no college probably want a kid like me
I told her let them see my art and we’ll see. Shouldn’t doubt me
Meanwhile, teachers taking me to schools to speak
And show my work, yo these youngin’ were me but even better
Saw I made a difference later on when they would visit
Then join the school I attended, look, another new beginning…
Eh ma, by the way, peep this Pratt acceptance letter
Never say never

[Hook:]
Real or not I want it
And once I got it
You know I gots to flaunt it for all
If it’s there I’m coming
Hundred miles and running
With the world on my shoulders to haul
Down a lonely road, trying to find my purpose
No telling what I’ll see
Low and behold, after all my searching
I found out its up to me

[Verse 3:]
Now as a man, Stan managed to stand
On my own when life was sketchy ‘cause I drew up a plan
To combine my art and music and expand my brand
Giving back to my students and of course the fans
I’m sure my purpose is service
So I see our challenges and work it out the best I can
Below the surface, don’t do it for the vine or cam
Fronting for a little backing never part of the plan
So what you here for? Me? Busy chasing down these dreams
When they close enough to see I be like “there it go” Got’cha!
Never will I knock a-nother trying to discover
Their path and where it leads. We travel at different speeds
Battle until we bleed when it’s looking rather bleak
Courage gather from deep til grasp what we seek
Long for it like Nia but Nia is what we needed
Some will chase it forever and may never get to see it
Most don’t see what I see
Most don’t hear what I hear

[Hook:]
Real or not I want it
And once I got it
You know I gots to flaunt it for all
If it’s there I’m coming
Hundred miles and running
With the world on my shoulders to haul
Down a lonely road, trying to find my purpose
No telling what I’ll see
Low and behold, after all my searching
I found out its up to me
