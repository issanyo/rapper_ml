[Verse 1: Mr. SOS]
As I vaporize into the thick of the bassline
I visualize lost memories from way behind
Playing and rewinding like digital videos
With alternate endings depending on the way you go
And I could recall
Such a moment when I was just youngin
And some of my cousins were just huntin something to cum in
I was strugglin searchin for something wholesome
And the thought of settling down was awesome
But it costed something I couldn't afford
Money & time because "I'm busy trying to be large" I kept saying
Just because most of em kept playing with me
Makin me holler, "I gotta get away from the city
And surround myself with something banging & pretty
Amazing & witty cause all i see is dangerous biddies in my face and it's killin me."
Somebody asked me
Why I don't settle down. I told him, "She has to be
Something organic."

[Hook: Kokayi]
Baby saying ooh you got me in the mood
To try out something new
Something wholesome and true
Is that you?
Baby saying ooh you got me in the mood
To try out something new
All natural
Is that you?
Baby saying ooh

[Verse 2: Substantial]
I'm zonin as I home in on these visions from the past
Deciding what to immortalize with my pen and pad
When I was a teen I was living fast
Getting ass and kickin it
Flirt in class then skippin it
An idiot
Young, dumb, and full of short comings
Though my dreams were epic
I was tryin to poke somethin
I know it seem pathetic
But I didn't know nothin
Til my rude awakenin, I was truly shakin in my boots
Damn it's hard to swallow when you're taken in the truth
Can see what's waitin on you 'till you rearrange your view
Of course this was eons before my wife and daughter
Might've been harder to have them without gettin my life in order
But still...
Hard work strugglin through the ordeals
But I gotta give thanks for having somethin so real
Would've suck being stuck with someone who ain't authentic
Though we front
All a brother really want...
Is something organic

[Hook]
