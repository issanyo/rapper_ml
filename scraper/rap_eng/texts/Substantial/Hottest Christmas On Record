[Verse 1:]
Yeah…
Chuck a deuce to the cold
‘Cause your dude trying to go
Where degrees never freeze
Sixty two be the low...
...and the winters are tame
All I want for Christmas is some tickets baring my name
Rather chill where it’s warm I’ll provide the cool
Not a flake in range whole sky is blue
Big sis scooped the fam where we riding too
She replies we can do whatever you tryin’ to do
Bet that. Out here snow never a set back
Plan to have an early winter tan when I get back
(Ehh!)
Strictly chillin in the figurative sense
Plus I caught a whiff of an open grill by the fence
Some may assume it’s May or June ‘cause the feelings immense
Hipped your dude a year or two ago been missing it since
Now I swap my winter coat for a White Tee
Cup of hot cocoa switched with some Iced Tea
Shaping up nicely…

[Hook:]
Not quite Summer fam
But this a different type of winter wonderland
And almost 80 degrees
Inside evergreen outside there's palm trees
And it feels kind of ill
The smell of winter been replaced by a grill
Don't get no better
Hottest christmas ever on record and we out’chea!

[Verse 2:]
No skull hats, long jawns or Timb boots
Just sweats, short sleeve tops & gym shoes
F! a snowman & snowballs I’m so gone
Coppin’ snowcones or hitting up Coldstone
Might even call home to rub it in a bit
They like “Young, you so wrong… you know that you ain’t”
I’m like aww man, come on you could made the trip
But ya didn’t so long we bout to hit the strip
Bout to dip with the windows down feelin the breeze
Feel like Spring but there’s Christmas lights still in the trees
Feel at ease... couldn’t wait for winter break, see
Did it right to ensure that winter didn’t break me
Looking like we waited for this moment all year
Smiles all around ‘cause the fam’s all here
No one or cloud throwing shade, all clear
Egg Nog in the cooler it’s normally all beer
Aww yeah!

[Hook:]
Not quite Summer fam
But this a different type of winter wonderland
And almost 80 degrees
Inside evergreen outside there's palm trees
And it feels kind of ill
The smell of winter been replaced by a grill
Don't get no better
Hottest christmas ever on record and we out’chea!

[Bridge:]
Back home it’s so cold
More of the same is lame and so old
So I’m rollin’ (where the skyline’s blue)
And golden, (so much more to do)
Head to the backyard or the park
Grill to the sun go down and it’s dark
Then the next morning, (watch the kids open gifts)
I’m soaring (Nothing quite like this)

[Hook:]
Not quite Summer fam
But this a different type of winter wonderland
And almost 80 degrees
Inside evergreen outside there's palm trees
And it feels kind of ill
The smell of winter been replaced by a grill
Don't get no better
Hottest christmas ever on record and we out’chea!
