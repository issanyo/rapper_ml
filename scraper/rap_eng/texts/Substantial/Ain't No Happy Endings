[HOOK]
There ain't no happy endings, cause nothing really ends
When your life is over, another begins
And that's the way it works in the circle of life
Balancing those good days with the times of strife

There ain't no happy endings, cause nothing really ends
When this life is over, another begins
And that's the way it works in the circle of life
Balancing these good days in these times of strife

[Verse 1: Substantial]
I'm just trying to make it
Life's precious for granted I'll never take it
Every breath I breathe to me is sacred
Back when I was young, my only love was football and my mama
Learn to use curse words before I ever used a comma
Little bad ass
All I liked in school was gym and art class
Life's changin', I was age ten when my pop passed
His love for cancer sticks and alcohol prove to be tragic
My fam's seen it all we became immune to havoc
My lyrics is satisfaction to those who use to be addicts
Soothin' the beast within all those who use to be savage
I advocate the acronym F.U.B.U. speak to
As if my tongue was tatooed with the word uhuru
Using my freestyle to emancipate mind states
Fuck 21, I'd like to live to see 9-8
But this world's got me going bananas like a primate
People you thought you knew full of surprises like a blind date
And I hate
Cash flashing niggas with a passion
More to life than dollars and rockin' the latest fashion
Seems like we either wanna play ball or be assassins
While children go to bed to lullabies of guns blastin'
No matter the weather
I'm striving to make it better
But my motto is a contradiction "Never say never!"
I will not
I remain poetic like Gil Scott
So stand up, get up
My people keep your head up!

[BRIDGE]
And live everyday like it's your last
Cause life only get harder as time goes past
And yo, the sun might not come out tomorrow
Don't let your life end in sorrow

That's why you live everyday like it's your last
Cause life only get harder as time go past
And yo, the sun might not come out tomorrow
Don't let your life end in sorrow

[VERSE 2: Substantial]

I try to live day by day without a fear or a worry
It's no time to waste I make moves in a hurry
Used to be so clear now my vision's getting blurry
Streets is hotter than Tabasco sauce on chicken curry
Bullets fly from guns with no target in particular
Fatally hittin' ya
Leavin' bodies perpendicular
To those still existin'
Silencers hissin'
Piercin' the darkness
Bringin' forth another carcass
Total bedlam, swear these streets is infested
Filled with the many horrors that the devil manifested
Children molested
Nuclear weapons being tested
Somehow I avoided being shot or arrested
Brothers tried to bring it to me
Send slugs through me
Almost was bodied thrice back when I was just a juvy
Hard to deal thought about putting one in my own temple
Permanent scars on my physical and my mental
Sometimes I'm glad my niece is no longer around to see this
Not a trace of unity society's in pieces
Liquor spattered on concrete to mourn those that we miss
Watch day and night, controlled by unseen leashes
Watch day and night, controlled by unseen leashes
Watch day and night, controlled by unseen leashes

Yo, but no matter what...
You know something?
This is what you gotta do...
