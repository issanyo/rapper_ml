[Verse 1 : Substantial]
I usually write rhymes 'till my pen go dry
But the page remain blank after my first try
I won't lie it's hard singing something you never heard
Feels like I'm limiting my inner feelings with words
You deserve a lifetime of praise for real
Love me unconditionally through all ordeals
And I'm forever greatful and I thought you should know that
Allowing me to grow and never letting me go back
At times you were strict but I'm actually glad
Taught me how to be a man in the absence of dad
You stronger that anyone I ever met in the world
And even more precious than a diamond and pearl
Your parents are probably smiling on you through the cloud
'Cuz you done a great job, hope I made you proud
You're part of the reason I am what I am
Forever yours, sincerely, I love you dearly

[Hook]
I love my sisters, I love my women
Who've helped me out of the tight spots I've been in
And [?] there since the very beginning

[Substantial]
Sisters you've been on my mind, to you I dedicate this rhyme for all the good and bad times

[Verse 2 : Substantial]
Couldn't stand your little brother, when I was younger
But now we tighter than ever, sticking out for one another
More than my sisters, more like my other mothers
I gotta' give you props 'cuz I owe you a lot
Much more that what could be said in a verse
I got your back forever, I will never dispurse
'Cuz when the tables turn, y'all will do the same
Told me "Shoot for the stars", at the sky I aim
Whether poverty or fame I never forget you
You're beautiful I made the most now I bless you
Y'all part of the reason I am what I am
Forever yours, sincerely, I love you dearly

[Hook]

[Substantial]
Yo, check it out, it's dedicated to the Earth and the universe, 'cuz this is my way of saying "Thank you" and I'll always love you

[Verse 3 : Substantial]
Feels like I know you for years, though it hasn't been long
So for you I save the very last verse of this song
Knew you were something special since the first time I met you
But I played it cool 'cuz i didn't wanna sweat you
Couldn't deny my heart so I gave it to you
And since that very day I've been faithful to you
We see some good days and some times in the gutter
Even when I was home she would stay with her brother
Because we knew inside all we needed was each other
For things to work out and it did just that
[?]  recognized the beauty you possesed
You're blessed, even my mom love you to death
The rhythm of your heart's the track I dreamed of
I'd rather die than jeopardize this surpreme love
You're a part of the reason that I am what I am
Forever yours, sincerely, I love you dearly

[Hook]
