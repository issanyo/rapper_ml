I wish U were here
I wish U were, I wish U were…
I wish U were here
I wish U were, I wish U were…
I wish U were here
I wish U were, I wish U were…
I wish U were here

VERSE 1 (Substantial)
Peace Pops… still missing you
Want you here but I’m in no rush to visit you
I’ve been doing my best with this hand that life dealt
Momma held it down and that money you left helped
I’d give it all back just so I could chill with you
Get some guidance in these troubled times, would’ve loved to build with you
Fam and friends passed on, I hope they there with you
Some good ones came along I would’ve love to share with you
Been married for a while and I wish you could’ve met her
‘Least I finally figured out why the wife half is better
Gave your only boy a child, a girl like your first was
Must’ve turnout alright if she think I’m worthy of her love
I knew that writing this would take a while
But I’ve been trying to live the type of life I’d hope would make you proud
I can’t recall your laugh but maybe this would’ve made you smile
Bmore survivor who would’ve known that cancer take you down
But, I’ll always bring you up. Ren is always fascinated
I’ll ensure she know the cloth we were cut from wasn’t fabricated
‘Trice and I keep in touch and my nephew graduated
Now I’m a youth worker when your boy ain’t rap creatin’
I don’t do it for a plaque for a record I made
I do it to get a plaque they can place on your grave
Wasn’t perfect but your honor and respect are due
Regardless if the message doesn’t get to you… I need the world to know…

HOOK
I wish U were here
I wish U were (still alive), I wish U were (by my side)…
I wish U were here
I wish U were (available), I wish U were (unbreakable)…
I wish U were here
I wish U were (still around), I wish U were (not in ground)…
I wish U were here

I miss you, I miss you, I miss you so much
(I miss you, I miss you, I miss you so much)
I love you, I love you, I love you so much
(I love you, I love you, I love you so much)
