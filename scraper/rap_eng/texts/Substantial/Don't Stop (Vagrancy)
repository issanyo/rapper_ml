[Verse 1]
Yo! Microphone check 1-2 don’t st-op!
Here to bring you that raw Maryland Hip-Hop
Take it to tip top
Bring it back to the block
While my Mza FlipFlop
Find more samples to get chopped
He can do want he want
Kill it when the beat bump
Covered in shade amongst the presence of gi-ant
Pardon me giant
I despise tyrants
My words are immortal, every songs death defying
Hip-Hop didn’t die yet
You haven’t heard my shit
The album speaks for itself, when you see it buy it
Now back on topic…
Oh wait, there isn’t one
Really doesn’t matter ‘cause you can’t say this isn’t fun
If life is a b——, then at least pick a pretty one
A beautiful struggle
Treat her right, get her done
Do what you want to
My usual hustle
Isn’t for the weak it takes unusual muscle
Microphone check 1-2 don’t quit it!
Kicking hot shit since P the God said spit it
Shit!!! Think I didn’t?
I know no limits
No Master P punchlines been there did it
Drink Buckley’s like water ‘cause your boy’s that siddick
Y’all walk around like your spits acidic
You just got bad breathe but refuse to admit it
Couldn’t make a hit up against bad pitchin’
Rhymes that I’ve written, have touch mad spirits
Hard to do that when you’re writing bad lyrics
But the flow is so ugly that it’s known to crack mirrors
Teach you the secret but you don’t have clearance
Well Hello!
Y’all spine yellow
Birdbrain eccentrics I’m calm and mellow
Sick back, relax this is all day fellow
Shit bang so hard break through bone and marrow
Microphone check 1-2 keep flowin’!
I do what I do, you just keep the beat going
You know the speech potent
Make sure you keep rollin’
Crash so many house parties you gon’ need Slohman’s
Shield dog feel me?
My babydoll pretty
On her grown woman shit, I ain’t R. Kelly
I’m all for Bush, just not the former president
‘Cause when it’s all bald love there’s really no evidence…
That’s why I’m so hesitant
So ill I should be sponsored by cough medicine
It’s all relative
My song’s heaven sent
Hip-Hop ‘til I die I’ll rep the four elements
Tell your residents quick get the word out
Tell’em ‘bout this nasty ass rapper that you heard ‘bout
Peace, we’re out!
‘Til I see you next time
I know know you want more, be patient ‘til the next rhyme!

[Outro]
Microphone check 1-2 don’t st-op!
Don’t st-op!
Don’t st-op!
Microphone check 1-2 don’t quit it!
Don’t quit it!
Don’t d-don’t quit it!
Microphone check 1-2 keep going!
Keep going!
Keep k-keep going!
Microphone check 1-2 don’t stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! And I’m out!
