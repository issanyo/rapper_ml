Make love (x17)

[Verse 1 Substantial]
Waitin' from night to fall
Hopin' you might just call
I don't wanna fight at all
Without you there's no life at all
At least one that's worth livin'
Impossible to envision
We move with such precision
That it is labeled forbidden
We inspire tension of the sexual persuasion
Now let me blow your mind like intellectual invasions
I need it, I want it
Gotta have it at this moment
You got it, you flaunt it
My heart and soul is haunted

[Hook]
Make Love(x17)

[Bridge]
Make sweet music love
We can do it love
Make sweet music baby
Like only you can save me (x2)

[Verse 2]
I need more than your touch
Give me all you have to offer
I'm feelin you so much
That I just might meet you at the alter
Cross my heart hope to live
Happily ever after
It started with a kiss
That followed smiles and laughter
She like my presentation
But now there's hesitation
Hope there's no reservations
If so I'll just be patient
What's our next destination?
Let me take you higher through the sensual elevation

[Hook]

[Outro]
Darlin' your so seductive
Baby your so persuasive
You are my one and only
For you there's no replacement

[Bridge and Hook]

[Verse 3]
Waitin' from night to fall
Hopin' you might just call
I don't wanna fight at all
Without you there's no life at all
At least one that's worth livin'
Impossible to envision
We move with such precision
That it is labeled forbidden
We inspire tension of the sexual persuasion
Now let me blow your mind like intellectual invasions
I need it, I want it
Gotta have it at this moment
You got it, you flaunt it
My heart and soul is haunted
