[Verse 1]
Born and raised in P.G.C. where being me was easily
The hardest thing I had to do. Knuckles stayed black and blue
And if your gear wasn’t in style knuckas they would laugh at you
Booking dames with game but if you’re lame youngins’ is smacking you
(Down there) I’ve seen it all from robbery to murder
And all my dogs be using slang you probably never heard of
Bush is slang for bullshit, the irony
That it shares it name with the same suckers that lie to me
Beat is on some O.G. shit the perfect grove to ride with me
P.G. vs. D.C. was like constant sibling rivalry
We’re all family through the positive and negative
These wars in our streets repetively take our relatives see…
P.G. at it’s worse can eat alive a family
I’m lucky just to share this verse surviving the insanity
These eyes have seen some things that most people could never stand to see
That killed a little boy and brought alive the man in me

[Hook 1]
This is for Landover, Cheverly, Forestville, Suitland
C.H., D.H., whatever hood you in
Hyattsville, Mitchellville, New Carrolton, Largo
And everywhere else in between youngin’ yall know
From the average Joe or folks that’s rapping and sing
To the local Go-Go bands and bamas clapping them things
Before my ass moved to the County of Kings
I was a Prince George’s Boy just doing my thing

[Verse 2]
I’m from the home of cats like Sugar Ray Leonard and Martin Lawrence
Where I first picked up a microphone ready to rip opponents
Where fools be ditching school for a truckload of wings and mambo
And movies like menace had the whole hood thinking they’re gun-ho
Some know, but don’t have a clue how we do
Rappers borrowing our slang and try to use it like it’s new
But we’ve been calling bamas young since the days of old
When you didn’t get shot maybe your face got stole
If you’re never on the map then you’re forever in my heart
Regardless where I end up at P.G.’s where I got my start
Where every hood I lived didn’t respect me until I fought
And a bad one’s what they caught if “He’s pussy” is what you thought
Same youngin’ that did karate and stayed drawing and rapping
Rather go to your body than get involved with some clapping
Never thought I was Gangsta but I’m real without a doubt
Dudes be joning on your mama ‘til you steal them in the mouth

[Hook 2]
This is for Marlow Heights, Bladensburg, Laurel
O.H., T.H., wherever you call home
Upper Marlboro, Greenbelt, College Park, Lanham
And everywhere else in between youngin’ stand up
From the average Joe or folks that’s rapping and sing
To the local Go-Go bands and bamas clapping them things
Before my ass moved to the County of Kings
I was a Prince George’s Boy just doing my thing

[Verse 3]
They use to tell me “Stan dog you gotta spit that realness”
Long before other brothers did it for a deal shit
But I never killed shit at all maybe steal from a mall
Getting draws from a youngin’ that I chilled with
Battle rhyming wasn’t popping in my hood like that
They didn’t hate though ‘cause little youngin’ could write raps
Got serious with while living on Brightseat Road
I became known for choosing unlikely goals
But we gotta make the most of these lives we chose
All the shit I saw in MD help me write these flows
Not as wild as I use to be wifey knows
Young, dumb and full of cum could barely wipe my nose
Seen them all from righteous queens to trifling hoes
Fronted on ya boy Stan ‘cause they ain’t like his clothes
Was a nice guy so why come they spite me fo’
Oh yeah didn’t have that hundred dollar Nike doe
Acting bougie ‘cause their fam moved from South East to Bowie
Or Landover to Fort Wash. our rents less than their door knob
Even broke with no job they watched this youngin’ go hard
Wherever I rest I’m holding down home like Coast Guards

[Bridge]
Ohhh M-D (I can't hear you)
Ohhh M-D (I know that's right)
Ohhh P-G (you better let them know)
Ohhh P-G (alright now)

[Hook 3]
To my people in Seabrook, Bowie, Greenbelt, Morningside
Ft. Wash, Langley Park any where you reside
Clinton, Adelphi, Brandywine, Brentwood
P.G.’s in the muthafuckin’ building don’t it feel good
From the average Joe, folks, that’s rapping or sing
To the local Go-Go bands and bamas clapping them things
Before my ass moved to the County of Kings
I was a Prince George’s just doing my thing
