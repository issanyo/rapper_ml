[Verse 1:]
We celebrate a week long
Gonna get our eat on
Many things we'll speak on, elevate minds
And spirits is the reason
That we gotta keep on
‘Cause ‘tis season to congregate. Shine!
Headed to my man crib
Where the whole fam is
Together we banded since the days of old
Families expanded
Gave our parents grandkids
Unified we’re standing reaching our goals
Elders, children
My peers in the building
To those no longer living we say ashe
Pouring libations
Peaceful faces
Soulful vibrations made my day
Talk of better tomorrows
Life with less sorrow
A place where all folks value our lives
Fam and my next of kin
Chillin’, no flexin’
Counting our blessings, watching our wives... do the same

[Verse 2:]
Strengthening our bond as we thank the divine
Moving our people forward a day at a time
Speaking to our problems, making time to listen
Commemorate our past, restoring our traditions
While creating new ones… for instance
To my daughter Kwanzaa’s as normal Christmas
Gotta give her more if her future’s to be brighter
That’s my true duty as her father & provider
See her with her friends taking pride in her history
So overjoyed like witnessessing victory
Seeds making crafts while we chat ‘bout progress
You’d be hard pressed to hear us spatting out nonsense
Watching candles burn as we countdown the days
Greeting you with peace followed by the phrase…
“Habari gani?” Depending on the day
One of these 7 principles is what you would say
Follow me now..
Umoja, Kujichagulia, Ujima, Ujamaa
Nia, Kuumba, Imani x2

[Bridge:]
I know when times get hard
We put all our faith is God
You still gotta elevate with me
Still gotta celebrate with me
‘Cause until we work as one
You know our work’s far from done
You know you gotta elevate with me
You know you betta celebrate with me
We see that times are bad
And it’s got us fighting mad
I need you to elevate with me
Really need you to celebrate with me
Stand up and lets rise
Open up your mind and eyes
So you can elevate with me
I want you celebrate with me
