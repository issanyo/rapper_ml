If you truly believe that you are a child of God’s creation
Then to doubt yourself could be viewed as the equivalent of doubting God
You feel what I’m saying?

Sometimes I wanna leave but I don't know where to go
Like there's nowhere to go
So I go with the flow
It's plenty I wanna see but I don't where to look
Maybe I fear the journey and appear to be shook
And I know I need to chill but I don't know how to rest
Running nonstop now I'm so out of breath
So I breathe in breathe out
Catch the beat then catch my breath
Somedays my raps are deep or lack in depth
At times when I don't know where I'm headed
I know there's locks on my head but I don't know why i'm dreaded
Could be better at it but at least I know how to love
But like long distance relationships I'm so out of touch and out of luck!

HOOK
I just gotta believe in me
‘Cause victory never comes easily
At least that’s the way that it seems to me
But we can change anything when we believe
I just gotta believe in me
‘Cause victory never comes easily
At least that’s the way that it seems to me
But we can change anything when we believe

I want to make it to the top but I'm scared if heights
Like being caught up in a war but unprepared to fight
So can I really win if I’m afraid to battle?
How will I see the world if I’m too scared to travel?
The pressure that I’m up against, so hard to deal with
Though we never met I know y’all can feel it
I want to be invincible but I'm merely flesh
At times I feel I'm cursed though I'm really blessed
When I reveal a verse, some may feel it's fresh
It hits home for them
Like the songs for them
But I'm glad that somebody can relate to my pain
Because if you didn't they might just think I'm insane
Sometimes I want fame but then I check my ego
'Cause what I really want is to connect with people
Feed my seed, provide for her and the misses
While my next obstacle waits to emerge in the distant future

Hook

I want to be great I want to make you proud
Shake the doubt and the hate that's trying to break me down
Can you believe in God without believing in you?
By trying to find out who you are you're only seeking the truth
I wanna hold my own
Gotta get a grip
Cross this alone
And pray I never slip
I'll take the challenge
Maintain my balance
Like a pillar of strength
Until you feel my intent now rock with me
