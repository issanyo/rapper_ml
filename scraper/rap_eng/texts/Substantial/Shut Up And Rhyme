[Intro]
D-O-M-I-N-I-O-N
D-O-M-I-N-I-O-N
D-O-M-I-N-I-O-N
Rip shit apart from the start til the show end
D-O-M-I-N-I-O-N
D-O-M-I-N-I-O-N
D-O-M-I-N-I-O-N
Rip shit apart when it drop Mecca go in!

[Verse 1 - Mr. Mecca]
Now I can either talk about me or rap about you
Now which outta the two are you thinking I’d rather do
But you’d rather grab the mic knowing you had to lose
Like Mecc gonna be aight with them bad attitudes
Who’s mad at it? I am!
Smack hands “bad faggot!”
Sure shot Glocks don’t send pen-knives to take a stab at it
That kinda bad habit leave ya man battered
Make your first move, I’ll cause your last panic
You stay ass
Gay mans garbage and you straight trash
Skip a priest. I’m giving my inner demon a day pass
It’s the beast, chewin up imaginary Maybach’s
Split the lease?? You ain't payin shit off with play cash
Ya girls smile say she don’t buy you fly as I is
But I smashed before so ignore her strong bias
Want us to say ya hot? You done got with the wrong liars
Strong tryers end up using mic cords for jaw wires

[Hook]
Ay! I don’t give a fuck about swag, I just need yall to shut up and rhyme. OK?!
I don’t wanna hear shit about cash, not unless a cut of it’s mine. OK?!
Somebody get ‘em a late pass, ‘cause we grind all the time. OK?!
And I will whip that ass, if you ever come across the line. OK?!

[Verse 2 - PackFM]
Michael Jackson moonwalked
I run planet earth
Things happen for a reason
And this was the plan at birth
Best believe it’s no coincidence this man is worth
More than his weight in gold
All off the way he flows
You lost? The way to go
Turn off the radio
If you snooze, you lose
Revolution won’t be televised
You can’t catch it on Youtube
So kill all the chitter chat
When you get attacked
You won't get a chance to say “Lemme twitter that”
The kid is back in the atmosphere
The best distro I ever had was Rapidshare
So have no fear, when you see the nervous twitch
Like detergent sticks, put me on the spot I got the urge to spit
I murder this, word to this Y Chromosome
I catch wreck with no hands, and still hold my own
Im from the ground up, home grown
So when they said sky’s the limit
I poked a hole in the ozone
YO!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Substantial]
I’m Moses with a pen
Talk like a prophet
Known to spit a gem
So my talk make a profit
My values are valuable
My views are crystal
In plain black & white, this dudes official
If you’s a pistol
This dude’s a missile
Blow up anywhere in the world from where I stand
And Maryland is where I am
Better tell’em
You pussy in a man wardobe, you’s Ellen
Your mixtape’s better than your album
How come?
Now your income’s a reflection of the outcome
‘Cause your units are funny
Your old fans are like “I shouldn’t never gave you niggas money”
My sentiments exactly
I’ll always have a punchline if you insist on rapping
I stick to the truth
You insist on acting
Get in the booth
Then you insist on tapping
And I ain’t gotta prove I’m realer than y’all
I just hold up a mirror to y’all
Look… niggerdom!
Fuck any dumb ass fan that’s feelin’em
Y’all ass so for kicks I put my foot in’em
And rock’em to the dunk exchange, look newness
They point at my feet like “Them shits is stupid!”
I know, right?!
Nobody as fresh as this
Hitman for hire, check my references
