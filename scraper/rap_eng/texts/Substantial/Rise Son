[Hook: Substantial]
I’m risin’ failure won’t due
Horizon’s fresh and brand new
Risin’ I radiate power
Shinin’ til my final hour
Risin’ failure won’t due
Horizon’s fresh and brand new
Risin’ I radiate power
Shinin’ til my final hour

[Verse 1: Substantial]
Will I be remembered is the question that I ask
As time pass and I’m looking in the mirror
In fear of being judged on my mistakes
Am I inferior because of my bad breaks
Lord knows that I’ve made my share
Am I a broken angel God can’t repair?
How dare I... entertain that notion
When my blessings are as vast as the ocean
Switch my devotion to those in need
Felt hopeless when my focus was greed
Indeed, I am better than I once was
Know it’s what I need now I don’t just want love
And respect instead of regrets
Making the most of this game with no reset
Or cheat code, I am in beast mode
Time spent training is time well bestowed

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Substantial]
I can keep sittin’ on the couch doubtin’ my destiny
Or keep climbing mountains until the death of me
And just complete the task at hand
You know step by step’s the master plan
And a quitter’s something this brother will never be
Probably why that’s something from me you’ve yet to see
Stop being a child act as a man
That’s really all that God has asked of Stan
I have the plan just gotta to see it thru
But I didn’t know where the path would lead me to
En Route to seek and speak the truth
I hope my food for thought can feed me too
If I’m right the limelight won’t keep me fooled
To keep a brother humble I teach the youth
Remember where I came from, A PG dude
With a global outlook and a to dream to boot

[Hook]

[Bridge: Substantial]
Rise son, keep rising
Share your light and keep shinin’ (Come on)
Rise son, keep rising
Share your light and keep shinin’
[Repeat 1X]
