[Intro: Substantial]
Everything I do fam I do it just for you
I'm just trying to live a life free of poverty and strife (uh huh)

[Verse 1: Substantial]
Chilling in my living room with my pad and my feet raised
Headphones on sitting back as the beat plays
Cool like I steer clear of the heat wave
Find peace whenever I see my seed play
Even though the murder rate high where we stay
That don't keep us from living it up each day
Cause we may never see the day after this one
So we live without delay
Nowadays it don't pay to be hesitant
Want change and they pray that it's heaven sent
Cause you never been a baller or a d-boy
But who knows you may be president
Turning heads like you're out of your element
Sometimes you gotta roll out to get it in
Let my words settle in like medicine
And maybe we can grow to be better men

[Hook: Substantial]
Cause we do for you (and we do for it you)
Yes we do it for all of y'all (uh huh)
We do for you (and we do for it you)
Yes we do it for all of y'all (uh huh)
We do for you (and we do for it you)
Yes we do it for all of y'all (uh huh)
We do for you (and we do for it you)
Yes we do it for all of y'all
C'mon!

[Bridge]
Everything I do fam I do it just for you
I'm just trying to live a life free of poverty and strife (uh huh)
Everything I do fam I do it just for you
I'm just trying to live a life free of poverty and strife (uh huh)

[Verse 2: Substantial]
Chilling at the park with my fam letting stress go
Trying to wind down between now and the next show
Ghetto living hit hard like a death blow
Just know we got to stick together like [?]
Prices still high as heaven on petro
Hard to be on the up and up when your check low
So I get up on my grind Joe let's go
Keep it moving nonstop like NY Metro
Best flow and fresh clothes don't mean jack
I ain't out buying gold fronts with green backs
Cause it ain't like my daughter can eat that
Long as I'm real with myself I'll never be whack
Hasn't been easy but I'm proud to be black
You see that by how I live my life and how we rap
Miss that that dope shit this is your relapse
Substantial and Blee, yes we back

[Hook]
Cause we do for you (and we do for it you)
Yes we do it for all of y'all (uh huh)
We do for you (and we do for it you)
Yes we do it for all of y'all (uh huh)
We do for you (and we do for it you)
Yes we do it for all of y'all (uh huh)
We do for you (and we do for it you)
Yes we do it for all of y'all
C'mon!

[Outro]
Everything I do fam I do it just for you
I'm just trying to live a life free of poverty and strife (uh huh)
Everything I do fam I do it just for you
I'm just trying to live a life free of poverty and strife (uh huh)
