[Hook: Substantial]
Give It Up, Let it Go
Keep it Moving, Move On
Give It Up, Let it Go
Keep it Moving, Move On
Give It Up, Let it Go
Keep it Moving, Move On
Give It Up, Let it Go
Keep it Moving, Move On

[Verse 1: Substantial]
I need a shower haven’t slept in 30 hours
And before I hit save my computer losses power
But I’ll do it over just to get a step closer
To my dreams and get this boulder size chip off my shoulders
I’m getting older trying to make it for my time pass
Wishing I could stick a cork in that hour glass
Jeopardizing my health to make my dollars stack
Silently fronting while I’m wishing they would holla back
I’m saying all of that better yet all of this
Because you don’t make these kind of sacrifices just to quit
So I welcome pressure like I can’t get enough of it
Grit on all my doubters then I tell them all to suck a Dick
Cheney… now we’ve moved to the Bush
Commutes a little farther but there’s music to push
Life’s a little harder but you use it or shush
No time for excuses, cause this dude isn’t pus!
A survivor, dodged 2 shots one point blank
Basically I’m everything that you toy’s ain’t
A man does everything that a boy can’t
That’s the way it’s been since the tender age of 10
When I took my pop’s seat at the head of the table
Still sitting there just as head of my label
Stayed strong for others when I barely was stable
Found my true self getting buried in fables
I sacrificed being hard for peace
Though I know they both are apart of me
That’s what I tell the seeds when they talk to me
Get my point across like crucifixes and archery
Too long I’ve been selfless time to be selfish
Collect my respect for the dues I’ve paid
And revaluate all the moves I’ve made
Questioning what’s inside like its 2Pac grave

[Hook: Substantial]
Give It Up, Let it Go
Keep it Moving, Move On
Give It Up, Let it Go
Keep it Moving, Move On
Give It Up, Let it Go
Keep it Moving, Move On
Give It Up, Let it Go
Keep it Moving, Move On

[Verse 2: Substantial]
Nothing in this life come easy ‘cept God given talent
So when these hard times got a brother feeling violent
I think about the sacrifices made
That help me reach the point where I’m standing at today

[Kool Herc]
Kool Herc y'all
I'm the elusive one
The one you hear so much about
See different pictures of me
But never see the real picture of me
You know I'm out here with my man Substantial, you know what I'm saying
Sacrifice, man, I'm still making sacrifice right now
You know, I'm just glad to be here man
Peace

[Outro: Substantial]
Give It up
Let it go
Give it up
Let it go
