VERSE 1
Every single day, rip a mic get a fan
But tell a groupie chick to get a life, get a man

Always on my job working’ right where I stand

While you recycling trash, no surprise you got canned
Meanwhile the hardest workin’ man in the underground

Back with the Other Guys again with another sound

Straight no chaser never giving you the run around

Pre Ante Up but right around Buck Em Down

I was (working) Hard…
Brushing off shit that leave most people scarred

I don’t flinch or ever quit push forward

No days off or off days, on guard

24 7, 3-6-5 good lord!

You already know this is PG’s
Finest with a never ending flow, it’s too easy

Find another brother this dope from the DMV

Jugglin’ my kinda workflow and still seeing me

HOOK
Working! All day. All night
Working! All day. All night
Working! All day. All night
Working! All day. All night
Working! All day… My grind’s just amazing

Working! All night… But I need a vacation

Working! All day… Exotic locations
Working! All night… I earned it. Just saying!


VERSE 2

One! And here comes the two to the three and Four

Plenty on my plate and I’m taking on some more

‘Til the point that it breaks and I can’t take no more

Now I know what I can take but I had to be sure
Givin yall the raw
Give it up I’m similar to Savion to floors, tapped into my core

But hold the applause

Got dollars but change is what I’ve been working towards
Backwards to yall... then you missed the metaphor keep up

Bluecollar dirty but look how nice I cleanup

Traded in my shot glass for a teacup

Funny to the reaper say your life’s lease up

So I make the most out of life ‘cuz
This the only one that I got

I know I need to recharge ‘cuz I’m working too hard
But I’ve come too far for me to stop, so I’m working...

VERSE 3

What’s it all for if he working each and everyday

Can’t even afford a simple getaway

Or maybe he caking nonstop with no time for vacationing

But ain’t that the whole point of making it

Living in America home of the free

Can’t afford free time to chill and just be

Family cruise w/ wife and kids, just flea

Locked in his room and he never saw the sea
That’s easily been me, feelin’ guilty just for sleeping in

Work. Eat. Work. Maybe rest. Then repeat again

Infinite todo, list he will never see the end

Working thru the night just for everyone to sleep on him, DAMN!
