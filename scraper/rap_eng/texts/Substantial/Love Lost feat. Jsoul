HOOK
Better to have loved
And to have lost
Then never to have loved at all
(At all)
Then never to have loved at all
(At all)
Then never to have loved at all
(At all)
REPEAT HOOK
VERSE
My heart's been exposed shattered and kicked
(Kicked)
Punched and ripped torn apart and stitched
(Stitched)
Battered and bruised but eventually healed
(Healed)
Might've been abused but it's never been killed
(Killed)
My heart beats still
(Still)
Like an infinite kick drum
Without it I'm ill
(Ill)
And feindin' to get some
Some of that...
.... (Yeah!)
Dopeness (Ya'dig!)
Trying to hide the pain with a dose of the****
Closer I get the more that it burns
But I don't know **** the lesson I learned
Let go of it but it always returns
So hard to quit got your fam and friends concerned
Do it all again but change a thing or two
But not play the blame game that's kinda lame to do
I'm the same as you
A little scared to jump
And put yourself out there you don't want to be punked
You
Wanna be loved
You
Wanna be claimed
By someone you trust until you're one in the same
Only those who ain't had it believe there's nothing to gain
Others are more like addicts fiendin' for wonderful pain
Over the years it's clear I belong to the latter
And you can hear my tears as they fall and they splatter
We shout like Tears for Fears over things that don't matter
Though my heart has been tattered and scattered it can be gathered
