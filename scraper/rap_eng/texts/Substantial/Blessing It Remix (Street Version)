[Verse 1: Substantial]
Yo, each one, teach one, we reach on
Maryland and Cincinnati to the Far East, son
And we just begun to spread the gospel
Substantial, Pase Rock hip hop apostles
Far from preaching with this art you call rapping
Taking y'all back from before this all happened
Fronting hardcore when you’re barely soft porn
Never penetrating the inner to get your heart warm
Rock on at a ridiculous pace
Disrespect hip hop and I'll spit in your face!
These kids are a waste of oxygen it's madness
Get in your case and all your shit like back checks
Got my eye on ya like insanity grabbed ya
Y'all CD packaging, and I can't stand rappers
You're bound to get ripped and then turned into garbage
I’ll stay blessing mics; my followers pay homage

[Hook: Substantial and Pase Rock] (x2)
Substan, blessing it; yes, I am, blessing it
UV for life Hell yes, we stay blessing it
Pase, I'm blessing it; Yes, I stay blessing it
Five Deez forever, you know we stay blessing it

[Verse 2: Pase Rock]
On point like the pens we write with
Living righteous in these times of peril and crisis
The pain’ll squeeze you lifeless (Dead)
What's it matter who's the nicest?
Who's alive, who's gonna live to see their life is
Hopefully me
My lifeline of emcee extends past to paying dues—how much it cost to be free?
Deep-rooted underground, but on the surface, a tree
Branching out—all I ever really wanted to be
They want to put us in a box and then pack it away
But we ain’t aving that, No pause, no which way
Yo, I'm going to the top and that's where I’ll stay
Fuck the middle ground
Cold, getting biz while you was sitting down
The joint sound hitting now, freestyle or written down
Your flow is played out, money—you need to get that shit in style
Speedy on the quick, fast; Long-term we make it last
Forever in a daze, stay clear of the path ‘cause, yo

[Hook: Substantial and Pase Rock] (x2)
Substan, blessing it; yes, I am, blessing it
UV for life Hell yes, we stay blessing it
Pase, I'm blessing it; Yes, I stay blessing it
Five Deez forever, you know we stay blessing it

[Verse 3: Substantial and Pase Rock]
Children of the Sun, look out, here we come
Live in Brooklyn; Maryland's where I'm from
We don't stop (Uh) 'til you've had enough
Five Deez, UV connect—that's what's up
Children of the sun, watch out, we’re coming for ya
Rocking from the ‘nati mid-west to California
And it don't stop even when you've had enough
Pase and Substantial, dude, that's what's up
Blessing it effortless; testing this?  Doubt it
Mic specialist, son; we kept events crowded
As nice as you wish you were, ripped mics are my signature
Thought you said your shit is hot—it's barely room temperature
We’re scorching, torturing cats from Cincinnati to New York and back
Word to Pat, don't Sajak
When we bankrupt your crew from spinning the Wheel of Fortune black
We take you there and send you walking back!

[Hook: Substantial and Pase Rock] (x2)
Substan, blessing it; yes, I am, blessing it
UV for life Hell yes, we stay blessing it
Pase, I'm blessing it; Yes, I stay blessing it
Five Deez forever, you know we stay blessing it
