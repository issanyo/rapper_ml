[Pre-Chorus: Substantial]
Yeah! Yo! Yeah!
Time to set sail and ride the wave
On the quest with my tribe tryin' to find the way

[Chorus: Substantial]
To explore new lands 'til my dying day
And then ride the wave to a high estate
So let's ride
Time to set sail and ride the wave
On the quest with my tribe tryin' to find the way
To explore new lands til my dying day
And then ride the wave to a high estate

[Verse 1: Substantial]
When I was a child my dreams were fairly mild
The thought of exploring the world seemed pretty wild
In a place, where you only leave home to see kin
Or you're locked up in an out of state pen
Then again, you could be off to fight a war
And leave behind all the people you adore
But for me God had something else in store
Share my voice with the world hit them with the raw
Now I'm off on the best ride of my life
Lucky to be alive
Couldn't deprive me of thought
And everything that has derived
From me being deprived
Help me to survive all
Tribulations that arise
Got back up and thrived
Now I'm back on my course
Which is to cross the seas and sky
Triumph in my eyes
Whenever I arrive on your shore!

[Chorus: Substantial]
Time to set sail and ride the wave
On a quest with my tribe trying to find a way
To explore new lands ‘til my dying day
Then I'll ride the wave
To a higher state
So lets ride
(Wave your hands)
Feel the vibe
(Just wave your hands)
Lets ride
(Wave your hands)
Feel the vibe
(Just wave your hands)

[Verse 2: Substantial]
Never washed up
Unless I'm on a beach in your city
Taking in the sites where the scenery is pretty
To leave would be a pity but a necessary setback
This evening I'll be busy, NY City then I'll head back
See all of my fam over in Japan
Sounds like that's the plan dope!
So can we kick it? Yes we can
Kenichiro that's my man
Do it on the piano
Yo!
Word is bond we heading Taiwan
Big up to Hana for taking time to put us on
I know my mama proud even though her son gone
For the holiday but I'ma be back before long
But I am so drawn to the journey that awaits
No choice
It's a trip I'm gonna have to make
My voice
Isn't mine I'm speaking for these kids
And of course the Divine whose power in me lives
Dig

[Chorus: Substantial]
Time to set sail and ride the wave
On a quest with my tribe trying to find a way
To explore new lands ‘til my dying day
Then I'll ride the wave
To a higher state
So lets ride
(Wave your hands)
Feel the vibe
(Just wave your hands)
Lets ride
(Wave your hands)
Feel the vibe
(Just wave your hands)

[Substantial]
No telling where I'll dock next
But um... when I'm there you know I got next
Uh huh... Let it flow until it crash
Ride the wave ‘til the moment pass
No telling where I'll dock next
But um... when I'm there you know I got next
Uh huh... Let it flow until it crash
Ride the wave ‘til the moment pass

Lets ride!

Wave your hands
Just wave your hands
Wave your hands
Just wave your hands

[Chorus: Substantial]
Time to set sail and ride the wave
On a quest with my tribe trying to find a way
To explore new lands ‘til my dying day
Then I'll ride the wave
To a higher state
So lets (ride)
