[Verse 1A: Mr. SOS]
More underrated than Siskel
Comes a squad that’s a label that’s fit too
Leave ‘em Marked like J-Lo with issues
And you don’t want us to break out no pistols
Cause if we do we’re hittin' all y’all women and kids too
Then you for not raisin’ ‘em, Send you where Al-Qaeda went
Cause you ain’t no soldier – You’re getting raped by ‘em
I’m sick of the nonsense cause this is Asterisk:Two, (Four!)
See I’m just making sure they actually knew

[Verse 1B: PackFM]
Now that I got your attention, we’re the ones that ya eye’s on
We made it to the top, It seems like the prize gone
Y’all squeeze the life out of rap like a python
But fuck it, love is love and bygones is bygones
We here now, this is our year now
Yeah, we said it last year but we in full gear now
This ain’t underground, it’s just beneath the surface
Spit rhymes that ya momma like and ride the beats perfect
And y’all nervous cause this the beginning and
You soundin’ sweet like a synonym for cinnamon
Niggas pull ya card, you said you did it for the Benjamins
Claimin' that you out for cake, you really wanna enta' men
But in the end…this house we built from the ground up
And this here’s a “Fuck You!” to anyone who doubt us
We spit til the plaques on the wall that we got rust
And split wit ya props and ya girlfriend knocked up
(Slut)

[Scratches]
This here is hip hop in fifth gear
It ain’t 94, joe, we can’t go back
This here is hip hop in fifth gear
If I put it into the 6th, the song will disappear

[Verse 2A: Session]
Yo it’s Session! You already know what I’m ‘bout to do
Spit ‘n show you how to do rockin' powder-blue
Y’all thinking Tone is rich, he’s recording the hottest dude
Spittin', while you been rhyming for years and do not improve
Secret weapon’s what he got right here
The seventh bullet in the chamber you forgot was there – BANG!
Hit you in the forehead between ya ears
QN5, New Hip Hop, the team is here

[Verse 2B: Elite]
I gets down, Dramatic sounds is the hardest
Our producers is betta than ya artists
These labels givin' deals, n they take em back
Quick as yall makin' tracks since you saw fade to black, damn
Gotta get that one single just find it
Not one single hot song on ya whole album besides it
The market I'm crossin' like crawford
As often as organs obsorbin' the carbon
From smokin' a carton of Parliaments!

[Bridge: Camelia Rose Qabazard]
You claim that the music’s dead and turn off your radio
You pine for the golden age and long for the days of old
No matter how hard you try, you can’t resurrect the past
Cause this is The New Hip Hop, the future is in your hands. (Whoa)

[Hook]
Don’t let em tell you that there’s nothing new under the sun
(Hey! We gonna work it out)
Cause you can always improve on what’s already been done
(Keep pushin on and on)
Keep pushin' the walls til they start crumblin' down
(Hey we gonna work it out)
Cause nobody believes you’re the king till you’re wearing the crown
(Put your ride on fifth, and let’s roll)

[Verse 3A: Substantial]
See, I’ve tried to hear y’all out, but I’m honestly kinda bored
I stopped making “94” Hip Hop… in ‘94
Born and raised in the age when biting wasn’t allowed
And you were slayed on the stage for reciting somebody’s style
Force-feed you the future with no room for refusal
(Still true to the art). Got Kool Herc’s approval
My forthcoming album will kick it to fifth gear
Still five steps ahead, the moment you get here
Shit yeah

[Verse 3B: Tonedeff]
The armada’s comin' with battleships
Beating our foes, embarrassing plenty average combatants
And seeing the bones get scattered like twenty mannequin-accidents
Leaving ya lone and barren like Jenny Aniston’s abdomen
Keeping these motions active, We’re deep in the throws of passion
These talentless hacks are lacking, with beats, performing and rapping
We seek to destroy every weak little toy who gets geeked when their boy
Peaks at the point of making some regional noise – Yeesh! You’re annoying
And we’ve been warning y’all niggas for years
Don’t act like these words are foreign to your ears… the reforming is here
And though the shade of revolution is red
We take it a step newer, instead, the freshest blood’s baby blue till it’s bled
And you’re regressionist movement is dead
And you clueless dudes who refuse to play new shit instead just put two in it’s head
And you’re clueless, and yet, you’re glued to a set of senseless rules
That were set by a proven group of vets who eventually grew up and stepped
Cause ain’t no time to reminisce over you
My patience has been tried by 12 years of predictable news
If you sift through the clues you’ll be quick to deduce
That when it’s time to come clean and be paid in full the Q-N-Nickel is due
So, let’s spark this offense off with a proper start
And spit tighter than Dolly Parton’s bra gets when menopause hits
Aww shit! Y’all should watch listen and follow along
If you lost consciousness, check the stick – bet it’s on fifth
(Come on)

[Scratches]
This here is hip hop in fifth gear
It ain’t 94, joe, we can’t go back
This here is hip hop in fifth gear
If I put it into the 6th, the song will disappear

[Hook]
Don’t let em tell you that there’s nothing new under the sun
(Hey! We gonna work it out)
Cause you can always improve on what’s already been done
(Keep pushin on and on)
Keep pushin' the walls til they start crumblin' down
(Hey we gonna work it out)
Cause nobody believes you’re the king till you’re wearing the crown
(Put your ride on fifth, and let’s roll)
