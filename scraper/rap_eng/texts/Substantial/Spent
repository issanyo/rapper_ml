[Verse 1:]
My favorite holiday is Christmas
Though I hardly qualify as Christian
Got that good hair 'cause I'm part Indian
Plus whole fam go hard at Thanksgiving
If I'm missing it's cuz I'm lined up
Trying to give'em my business before its marked up
Stiff arm shoppers like it's all mine what
Boy dem deep discounts done got me fired up
Don't fool with Kwanzaa dog it's so wack
They don't even do gifts and I ain't pro black
Man I'm pro green and I gots to get it
Second that I got it I gots ta spend it
All brand names, I’m looking splendid
Yall got no class like yall got suspended
Bling for misses copped my son Batman
All praises due to jolly old fatman, Amen!

[Hook:]
Man it just don’t make no sense
I can hardly pay my rent
All this doe that I done spent
Out here trying to cop these gifts
Just don’t make no sense
All these festivities got me spent
Times are hard so hard we went
Almost spent up every cent

[Verse 2:]
If my girl copped me a wack gift then we’re thru
Might take back all that I copped for her too
To be my boo and worthy of praise
Need a PS4... plus some new Js
I’m out here burning up doe real wreckless
Swapped my check with a diamond necklace
Nothing like diamonds to say “I love her”
When you tryna slide her the stocking stuffer
I know money can’t buy me love but
I’m seeing more action Ji’like, somewhat
Screwed like a lugnut when my funds shrank
My account’s blank, no cash in the bank
No gas in my tank Mrs. Clause leaving
Nothing left to give, she done receiving
No longer present, yet it’s a wrap... ironic
Searching for gift receipts as I sip my tonic

[Hook:]
Man it just don’t make no sense
I can hardly pay my rent
All this doe that I done spent
Out here trying to cop these gifts
Just don’t make no sense
All these festivities got me spent
Times are hard so hard we went
Almost spent up every cent

[Verse 3:]
They talking ‘bout boycotting Black Friday
If I had my way, it would be 5 days
Then they talking ‘bout supporting Black business
I’m like it’s called Black Friday.. isn’t it
Alright, I know that a tad too ignorant
But I’d like to know why on earth should I give a ish
When a TV worth a G’s now three… hundred
Everything in me say hit the street running
Then they say we’re that second class citizen
But we’re the first to give up all my dividends
Outside of the neighborhood that we are living in
Meanwhile our life’s treated like it’s insignificant
Sure plenty times the service be dreadfool
‘Cause we ain’t really customers, thought of as a threat fool
And the folks our tax pay to serve and protect us
Most don’t do either let alone respect us
So why should I care about a holiday special
Tryna save a dime, when we need to save our self
Too many of us dying and we funding movement
They gonna kill your cousin, you ain’t gon’ do ish?!
Who the real menace? Ain’t hard to call it
But some of the ammo to fight back’s in your wallet
They don’t worship prophets they worship profit
Make them the target and hit them in the pocket
Pow-er

[Hook:]
Man it just don’t make no sense
I can hardly pay my rent
All this doe that I done spent
Out here trying to cop these gifts
Just don’t make no sense
All these festivities got me spent
Times are hard so hard we went
Almost spent up every cent
