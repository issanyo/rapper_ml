VERSE 1
I don't even know'em
Don’t be saying it's a wrap, when I ain't flowing
...Though I am at the moment
Opposites attract and also can be opponents
I am what I am, didn't plan to be chosen
Plus I can't break what was already broken
But Mister Fix-it put a plan in motion
Yep, you was with it, Goddamn it’s potent
But still runnin your mouth ‘bout your your last
Compared and contrasted with his bumb ass
Must’ve come pass for the hit & cum pass
Got the booty, got lost and tossed the compass
Dumb fast now your hearts protected
Let the wrong playa play now I’m ejected
(Ghetto) Not what I expected
Dikem-Bae, why am I rejected

HOOK
Girl I'm not your ex man
Though I might be your best man
But the question is...
Are you gonna let your past fuck with your present
And future (so what you really want bae?)
Loser (or start something with a real man?)
Sooner (or later, maybe even today)
You gon’ (have to make the right move bae)

VERSE 2
Switch up the tune
From dysfunctional to give us the true you ooh
Never let the past rule you
Bout to miss out on a good dude
Don’t get too comfortable
‘Cause, when I come for you
Ain’t nothing like what you use to do
Purple skies and blue moons
Scale it back if it’s too soon
Switch up the pace
Don’t need another man try’na put you in your place
If we ridin’, why be behind me, stand beside me
Journey to the top we can take turns driving
Never be a prop this a pure alliance
Never gotta crop any picture I’m in (no)
No shade, so vibrant
Rock 'till my breathin’ stop but know that

HOOK

BRIDGE
You should be with me but you got PTXD
Don’t let your past hold your future hostage that’s LL not me
Escape that hell and be free
Don’t have to forget just please leave
All that deep shit aside… he ain’t got a damn thing to do with me
What I’m saying is…

HOOK
