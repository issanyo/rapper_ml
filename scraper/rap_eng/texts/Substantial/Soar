[Hook x2]
Just trying to find peace of mind
Sit back let my seat recline
But it seems like...
Somebody wanna piece of mine
At war ‘til the beast resigns
Make things right

[Verse 1: Substantial]
I do battle with my art now that I've matured
Fight less the more that I've studied the art of war
Spend less paper and I barter more
Move smarter, what’s the point of working harder for
Back in the day we hustled until our palms were sore
Daily reminder of them times when we was kinda poor
Surrounded by my people who were kind before
The success and we’re blessed with a divine rapport
Thank the lord, for my fam in Baltimore
The DMV, BK & across the shore
Y’all of course, knew that I was born to soar
When they laughed, now raise a glass after the bottle pours
Omnivore, learned to make green with my beef
Dinosaur with a future who refused to go extinct
Connoisseur of tunes not found in most department stores
Cuz when it’s lost they leave my mind restored

[Bridge]
Fact:
Man a brother been through hell and back
Pressure that might bend you but I won’t snap
Tarnished from the disputes my armor won't crack
Stronger and I’m mentally intact
And when it’s hard to record
I focus on the moment when my daughter was born
It’s like that

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Substantial]
It’s amazing how we can find a way to make it
While some seek the thing you’re relying on to take it
Disrespecting your struggle they gotta know it’s sacred
Tune to go war with Goliath & you’re David
Doubters looking on like this guy ain't got a prayer
Unaware that of the giants you’re a slayer
Now I play the game as if I’m the only player
And knowledge of yourself can lighten up the labor

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Substantial]
I just focus on my blessings and the lessons she gave me
Such a powerful weapon when you’re stressing like crazy
Plus in or out a session I got brethren to save me
They’ll come through in a second so don’t question their bravery
I’ll maneuver these waters like a vet from the Navy
M.I.A. for weeks trying to get to my lady
From my slice of heaven let no fella negate me
Strengthen by its essence so I cherish it greatly
Its power are of legend I won’t let it escape me
Without it they’ll break me, with it I am amazing
They try to deaden my drive, rather it dead than alive
Refuse to let them threaten the thing that help me survive
I’ll hide in the clouds overheads I reside
That’s my blood, sweat and tears when it rains from the sky
Working over time trying to bring these dreams to life
Cause you really ain’t free if you don’t have Peace of Mind
