[Verse 1: Substantial]
Listen
Keep my enemies near and my sword even nearer
Immaculate polish on my sword, it be clearer
You could go blind from a door in its glimmer
Callous knuckles in the palms of a stiller
Work well witht the blade, equally sharp
Bleed if you start, you will sleep in the dark
For eternity for my unmatched swiftness
Never duplicated but some have witnessed
A true master, honour intact
Cool as Northern winds while under attack
Til I'm legend like Hattori Hanzo
To you thrill-seekers who truly want more
For my clan here to serve our Lord
Whether we lend a hand or wield our sword
Oceans go red, blood spilled on shores
Some rest in peace, others still at war

[Hook: Shing02]
Some days, some nights
Some live, some die
In the way of the samurai
Some fight, some bleed
Sun up to sun down
The sons of a battlecry

Some days, some nights
Some live, some die
In the name of the samurai
Some fight, some bleed
Sun up to sun down
The sons of a battlecry
A battlecry

[Verse 2: Substantial]
Moment drenched terrain only like we sees
My blades' reflection swung with might, it speed
Got a warrior spirit ease a fight in me
Refuse to be throbbed of my right to bleed
For my land and people, and bushido
No clans are equal, their plans are see-through
At times your own confidence can defeat you
When faced with adversaries commandin' evil
A humble servant, familiar with sacrifice
Hard to understand, when your heart's as black as night
Some deny the true hero inside
You can see their souls' envy when you stare in their eyes
I remain opposite of the spectrum
Fear no opposition, but God I respect them
Just want the seven ways of the warrior
Whether samurai or you play the auditor

[Hook: Shing02]
Some days, some nights
Some live, some die
In the way of the samurai
Some fight, some bleed
Sun up to sun down
The sons of a battlecry

Some days, some nights
Some live, some die
In the name of the samurai
Some fight, some bleed
Sun up to sun down
The sons of a battlecry
A battlecry
