[Verse 1]
I came into this world
Same way I'm gonna leave it... alone. For what its worth
Since birth... been bringing folks together for a common cause
Not quite a bleeding heart no need to find a gauze
Just tried to do what’s right ain’t gotta supply applause
Just trying shed light on what they hide from us all
Our origin story, many moments of glory
Move forward, ain’t gotta be rewarded, the Lord has implored me
Give’em what they need when they don’t even want it
Keep on feedin’ souls but they don’t see they hungry
Live a life worth remembering, the reaper’s coming
But you’ll live forever though you might not reach your twenties
Or your thirties, f*** a great depression
You are worthy... of every single blessing
Honestly, our own light is hard to see
But every single star’s born to shine. Prophecy!

[Hook: Fjer & Substantial]
Always… always...
Always… always… (I am here)
Always… always...
Always… always… (I am here)
Always… always...
Always… always… (I am here)
Always… always…
Always… (I ain’t going nowhere… ever)

[Verse 2]
When she came into this world
I knew I’d never leave her alone because this girl’s
The greatest thing I created... lyrics, design or painting
That ain’t up for debating. Look what sun maid and he raising her
Right… so God forbid her brother man wrong her
She roll with the struggle ‘til she come around stronger
But her father taught her to never squander her honor
If they don’t treat you as good or better than poppa don’t bother
She see how I treat her mama. And before we shared that wedding cake
I swear on my own mama you’re the best decision I ever made
Look at what we made. On everything, I’m proud of us
Best producer duo since The muthaphucin’ Stuyvesants
Listen… This is parentin’ with a vision
I swear a bit cuz that’s how Ms. Hill got us to listen
So pardon me, busy raisin’ my colony
This home that love built never falls, stands solidly\

[Hook: Fjer & Substantial]
Always… always...
Always… always… (I am here)
Always… always...
Always… always… (I am here)
Always… always...
Always… always… (I am here)
Always… always…
Always… (I ain’t going nowhere… ever)

[Bridge]
Rain, sleet, hail, snow
Will I retreat, hell no
Can’t stop, must grow
Won’t drop, never let go
Rain, sleet, hail, snow
Will I retreat, hell no
Can’t stop, you must know…
I ain’t going nowhere… ever

[Verse 3]
We came into this world
With everything we need so we manage what it hurls
Always and forever you’ll never get us to behave
Scared to death of kings they’d rather my people be slaves
So til hell freezes… I will resist…
The call to hang it up as long as I am needed
Silence your siren you woke up this giant from sleeping
Fightin’ like we’re Tyson and titan mixed with a phoenix
