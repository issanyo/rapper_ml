[No more games. 'Ey yo. No more games, cuz game over!]

[Rock of Heltah Skeltah]
On the count of three transform
B-Set, not DJ's
Run through any hood, even Eddie Murphy PJ's
If we ever see him, we beat up the rasta, take his herb
Oh he gone now?
Yo somebody must have sent them the word, ya heard

[Ruck of Heltah Skeltah]
Murkey today, Decept(icon) purple and grey
Feel the burst from the tre, see the urban decay
Never fuck with you cowards cuz you're worthless and gay
Take your hat and coat ,niggas leave you shirtless in hay

[Skoob of Das EFX]
Yo, Yo, Yo, Life's a bitch I'm trying be twice as rich
Ice to wrist, trying cop priceless shit
Things ain't changed, still terrorise the game, bring the pain
Still living my thundom range
Ready to ball, don you ain't steady you fall
On the downlow your found low in the ground yo
Come around yo, mad sex and drugs
Puff a haze in the custom made Lex on dubs

[Chorus]
Game over, lets see if you can play with the best
Game over, who next, step up and get wrecked
Game over, and we only play with respect
Game over, its over soldier, told ya
Game over, rewind if you wanna play again
Game over, that's fine but you still can't win
Game over, with the joy-stick or the pen
Game over, its over soldier, told ya

[Glaze NY]
Yo, I got chips in the stash, schemes to get cash
Tits I could flash, and a thong in my ass
Bitch go against me, ya better think fast
Hide your bodyguards and your bulletproof glass
For ya!

[P Dap]
Push the six while I ride shotgun with a shotgun, give a fuck if the cops come
The type of cat who come palm your face, invade ya space
Daper daddy dealing with your case

[Substantial]
Rappers get engines, now they strictly stains on my fender-a
Niggas drop, had the biggest drug like a cinderblock
You're a waste of sperm, or taught like Howard Stern
Fucking germ how you want this saliva or lubricant

[Hakim]
See I ain't gotta rock in your cife to prove that I'm nice
I ask niggas they tell you I ain't new with the mic
But every now and then, niggas wanna test the chen
I came in piece but that's what I leave 'em resting in

[Chorus]

[Agallah]
'Ey yo, pass me the potion
All of you flash into a corvotion
Im the one holds and spits this shit with emotion
As soon as i'll closing, all of you stop the commotion
Agallah bitch I'll open
The name is selfspoken

[Loose]
We run NYC with the pounds to get high
Serve niggas from hempstead, queens to bedstuy
Lime green wheely niggas with red eyes
Nigga hot green go with the force like jedis

[Tuffy]
Niggas roll the dutch to this shit, cuz my words like herb
This track's getting blazed and the mc's get served
You know the signs we don't wanna wake up the yearn
And take more L's to the chest than laverne

[Masta Ace]
A lot of niggas switch and transform into a bitch
Once they get the green light mitch and become rich
Your cute song ain't hot nigga, its lukewarm
And what I'm on is hip hop in its true form

[Chorus]

[Misery]
It took me two days to maintain my verbal A.K
Misery spray, at any emcee in his way
No doubt about it, I bought it bout it then brought about it
Ya wanna start it, I'm leaving motherfuckers dearly departed

Ya sore losers pressing the restart button
When we roll up, you say nothing
Party crashers with permanent hangovers
Shut the fuck up, pass the mic, game over
Sore losers pressing the restart button
When we roll up, you say nothing
Party crashers with permanent hang overs
Shut the fuck up pass the mic, game over
