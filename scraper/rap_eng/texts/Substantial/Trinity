Yo
I'm struggling to keep my eyes open
But now she's crying down the phone saying her guy's hopeless
Ay' yo she knew from the beginning but ignored the notice
Guess she was hoping he was open to show his devotion
Forever floating in an ocean, erotic emotions
So what's the notion that can bring her to this very moment?
Where she is doubting her decision for the one she's chosen
She telling me it went from perfect to lots of commotion
He pass the blame to her whenever she be outspoken
And then they argue to the point where she need Ibuprofen
Mascara running, she was stunning now her eyes are swollen
He treat her like he a remote cos he is so controlling
And all this time I'm thinking I don't even have a clue
Feel like we've both been here before and she know what to do
But will she listen, or just pay no mind to my advice?
She may be better off speaking to my homie Cise
(speaking to my homie Cise)

I don't know what more I should tell her
Cos she will never listen to me
I don't know what more I should tell her
(tell her)
I don't know what more I should tell her
Cos she will never listen to me
I don't know what more I should tell her
Cos she will never listen to me

(Cise Star)
Familiar message on my phone again
It be that chick that never listens and she needs a friend
I hate to break it to her, but damn it, I'm just not him
She be chasing after this tool, photogenic Ken
They always arguing, but smile for the camera lens
They gotta make it look good for the insta-grim
She needs to colon cleanse, keep it moving, leave him
Before even the foundation cannot hide the sins
Of the arguments he wins
She say "no it's okay, he just be mad some days"
"He don't even mean to do it, it's just something I say"
You keep making excuses for this dysfunctional loser
One of these days he will lose it put something in your medulla
And that won't make it to Instagram
But maybe to Twitter though
When the local news reporting so
I call her back and persuade her the best I can
But she keep me talking in circles so I transfer her to Stan

I don't know what more I should tell her
Cos she will never listen to me
I don't know what more I should tell her
(tell her)
I don't know what more I should tell her
Cos she will never listen to me
I don't know what more I should tell her
(tell her)

(Substantial)
She hitting me on my line, snifflin' and she cryin'
Sick of him and she tired, this isn't what she desired
Missin' each of the signs, revealing his true design
It ain't fiction, it's science, the sayin' that love is blind
Disregarded the cheating, 'cause it was better than beatings
Quality time was frequent, but now he gone every weekend
But he be keepin' tabs like Biggie, (Who you be with?)
The question I had asked was (Really?!, when you leavin'?)
Man this joker is wild, she gotta know when to fold 'em
A king worth her while, she gotta learn how to hold 'em
I told her, a queen must see that she is golden
And guard her heart from those that wish to leave it broken
She laugh and tell me, I'm so corny
And not to judge a book without knowing the whole story
True indeed, I tell her be well
Nothing else for me to say, but you can hit up DL
Okay?

Cos she will never listen to me
