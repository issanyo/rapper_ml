H-E-Art, We be Heart
And Soul, Proud and Bold

H-E-Art, We be Heart
And Soul, Proud and Bold

[Verse 1]
The music need a little more heart a little more soul
Either too hot or a little too cold
Way too many shallow verses
Nothing deep rather surface
Too weak to be defined as timeless
So we gotta guide these blinded rhymers
Away from their shiny diamonds and fancy coats
Show’em what matters most
Rappers boast, stunt and show off
Scared to be looked at as something so soft
Trying to be hard but they’re hardly real
Making so-called music you hardly feel
That’s why they leave a lot left to be desired
So I try to write to rekindle the fire
Lifting it higher this simple man with a pen
Trying to give you something you can feel again

[Hook x2]
He who’s in love with the art
Should know its always best to come from the heart
When the music don’t feel the same
Need to let the world feel your pain

[Verse 2]
And they love to hear it
Constructing lyrics to touch the spirit
So fresh it inspire the hopeless
Better myself and retire the dopest
Or at least well respected
I’m free to be me and I sell my message
But people are rarely rich
So for little or nothing I share my gift
While you…vibe to it stare and drift
In to space take your mind on a daring trip
To a place music nowadays never ventures
Embrace the experience let me enter
The next adventure remains a mystery
Then I paint a picture to stain your memory
And secure my place in history
In your heart I stay, come visit me

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I was told not to hold back
And wrote raps fo’ cats to use for healing
And say things that you ain’t use to hearing
Don’t believe everything the news revealing
So I grab mics and use speakers
To expose gems for the truth seekers
Cause they just might be the future leaders
Erasing all doubt making true believers
Of you and me (huh) all is possible
Self pride can make y’all unstoppable
And help you push through your obstacles
Peace is a must but war is optional

[Hook]
