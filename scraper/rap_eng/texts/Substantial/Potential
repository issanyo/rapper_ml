BABY, I know your feeling apprehensive
ABOUT THIS, this love thing can be so expensive
BUT YOU, you’ve got to hang in from the start girl
Cause only time can mend a broken heart
BABY, no need to worry
LADY, i’ll take me time
HONEY, show me your heart
OH GIRL, and i’ll show you mine
TELL ME, just what you like
AND I, i’ll try to make it
BETTER FOR YOU GIRL
Cause i know it when i see it

OH GURL YOU SHOULD KNOW WE YOU POTENTIAL, POTENTIAL BABY
OH GURL YOU SHOULD KNOW WE GOT POTENTIAL, POTENTIAL BABY

[Eric Roberson]
When i look at you “you”
I see a queen, i see a thing
That needs to be beside me through everything i do
And you, gurl you define what comes to mind
When i think of what i been dreaming all the time
BABY, no need to worry
LADY, i’ll take me time
HONEY, show me your heart
OH GIRL, and i’ll show you mine
TELL ME, just what you like
AND I, i’ll try to make it
BETTER FOR YOU GIRL
Cause i know it when i see it

OH GURL YOU SHOULD KNOW WE YOU POTENTIAL, POTENTIAL BABY
OH GURL YOU SHOULD KNOW WE GOT POTENTIAL, POTENTIAL BABY

See it starts with us just trying to kick it and chill
Peep how this has a different feel
No one can tell you that this isn’t real
Could leave if you wanted like you’re missing a wheel
This is so ill man it oozes potential
Most complicate things you keep it simple
Tough at times but you can be gentle
And truth is man I like that there
So exciting it’s a tad bit scary
‘Cause you the type of woman that a brother could marry
Sweet but spicy like mango curry
We’ll take our time girl ain’t no hurry
I could see a future with you
Lets ride this out let it do what it do
If this here is true
We can chill forever
‘Til we’re elders
Saying “We still together!”
