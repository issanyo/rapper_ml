[Hook]
Will it happen? Could it happen? I don't know
Signs are around me, everywhere I go
From P.G. County to Tokyo
Everywhere I go, the people wanna know...
How will it go down?!

[Verse 1]
I had a nightmare that I hope don’t come true (Talk about it, bruh!)
Black blood on the streets ‘cause they’ve blacklisted our hue (So ironic, huh?)
Thought it was a dream until I turned on the tube (What you seein’ mang?)
Murder, hate and sadness all I see on the news (Can’t believe it, mang!)
S‘pose to be the future but it look like the past (Seen it all before)
Master’s boot still on our throat when it ain’t up our ass (Time to go to war)
Bracelets come with collars, kept on a very short leash (Get it off of me)
Homes are now are cages, called animals by the beast (The hypocrisy)

[Verse 2]
I had a daydream while I was wide awake (Oh word?)
Opponents try to put a rack of shit upon our shoulders, they ain’t know it
But we just could not break (No sir!)
Had our community and businesses in order, we supported
Ourselves our own way (Indeed)
Greater schools within our zoning, our creations never stolen
Taught and owned what we made (No greed)
S’pose to be future but it could to be today (Talk about it)
Soon as you see your destiny is linked to ours
And acknowledge that these scars will not fade (Ain’t forgot about it)
And stop the whitewashing of our Gods far too long you been
Controlling our faith and fate
I pray, one day, we work together
Or lay to waste this world forever!
