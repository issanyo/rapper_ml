[Intro: Substantial + Funky DL]

[Verse 1: Substantial]
I’m headed out ta’
Various cities that I encounter
Handin’ concierge passports across counters
Cross timezones, find poems above clouds
Check in prior to mic checks after I touchdown
Triple S time, get rhymes in order
For the evening festivities. Make time for daughter
Via Skype ‘cause she missing me like I’m on a poster
And I am but it’s different see I am not lost but
Find me on stage, losing my self like Mr. Mathers
Spittin’ what matters to listeners at this particular gathering
...And I admit that I have a gift for the gab
But still make time to get equip for the path so I bring
...Something true to the table
So this music enables me
To go where few aren’t able
To do their thing
Lay the foundation for ‘em
Hopefully it’ll be discovered when they’re out their explorin’
Nah’mean

[Hook: Substantial] x2
I don't know
Where this path goes
But I'll be there

Mic in my hand
Soul pumpin' out my chest
While the DJ hold it down
Playing something I can bless

[Verse 2: Funky DL]
I am a child of music, flowing just like a cruise ship
I won't ever loose it, brighter then when the rooms lit
Holding the mic so tight, I'm bound to give it bruises
The way I do's this, It's like people are feeling clueless
Who' this? Funky, the lord of the underground
Strike like lightning, following with the thunder sound
BOOM! So come dance with me, while p-dot-r do it substantially
So what's the reason? we want to give you something to believe in
Every-time we take a piece of vinyl, pull it out the sleeve
And put a needle to it, you can feel a positive influence
Like a teacher to a student, at the same time it's the coolest
And every-time I do this, I don't question me
It's just my chosen path, journey, and my destiny
So like my man Stan say "We lay the foundation for them"
Hopefully they play this record when they're chilling on the corner
Nah'mean

[Hook: Funky DL] x2
I don't know
Where this path goes
But I'll be there

Mic in my hand
Soul pumpin' out my chest
While the DJ hold it down
With the records he suggests

[Outro: Substantial + Funky DL]
Fresh! ... Rest In Peace Nujabes
