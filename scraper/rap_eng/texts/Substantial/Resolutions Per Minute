[Verse: 1]
Trying to better myself every year but falling short
Should do it for growth but i focus on cheers I long support
Probably should cut back on all of the beers that I had bought
Lessen my eff-ups and get some clearer-minded thoughts
Clearly, I am fault but hear me, I’m a sport
That’s making some new resolutions I fear or all for naught
Smeared what I’ve been taught. Steering toward folk
On the road to perdition, frontier of all the lost

[Hook:]
What you gonna do? What you gonna change?
Try something new or remain the same?
Will you follow thru or give up like a lame?
Time to start again. 90 RPMs
What you gonna do? What you gonna change?
Try something new or remain the same?
Will you follow thru or give up like a lame?
Time to start again. 90 RPMs

[Verse 2:]
She wanna be ready for beaches, that’s why she barely be eating
Depriving her body of anything Godly impressing these heathens
Any new diet she find on a blog she pledging allegiance
Get any smaller and she will dissolve, what is the reason
Blind like a venetian, crying from all of the teasing
This ain’t attack on a titan she fighting her inner demons
Trying to pick up the pieces, finding what she’s been seeking
Promise to finally love her true self... ‘Tis the season

[Hook x2:]
What you gonna do? What you gonna change?
Try something new or remain the same?
Will you follow thru or give up like a lame?
Time to start again. 90 RPMs

[Verse 3:]
(Some people be like)
I will quit smoking, I will tweet less, work out more
Manage my debt, manage my stress, play a new sport
Volunteer, travel abroad, even recycle
Learn to knit, get a good job, study my bible
Go on more dates, meet some new people, try not to boast
Get laid, get married, probably both
Fix up my home, have a baby, get a new hobby
Read a lot more, hang outdoors, other guys be
Like “This is the year to put it in gear and soar
Can’t tell you what’s different but listen this isn’t the year before
Cause I had a vision of living a life that meant much more
Taking a chance to dance at the top won’t be ignore
I ain’t ever stopping, failure ain’t a option
Said to hell with caution, walk the trail no talking
Principles to live by, no more resolutions
Excuses replaced by fruitful execution

[Hook x2:]
