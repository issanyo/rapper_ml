[Hook]
Make Love, Make Love
Make Love, Make Love
Make Love, Make Love
Make Love, Make Love
Make Love, Make Love
Make Love, Make Love
Make Love, Make Love
Make Love, Make Love
Make Love...

[Verse 1]
Waiting for the night to fall
Hoping that you might just call
I don’t want to fight at all
Without you there’s no life at all
Least not one that’s worth living
Impossible to envision
We move with such precision
That it is labeled forbidden
We inspire tension of the sexual persuasion
Now let me blow your mind like intellectual invasion
I need it I want it
Gotta have it at this moment
You got it and flaunt it
My heart & soul is haunted

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Make sweet music love
We can do it love
Make sweet music baby
Like only you can save me
Make sweet music love
We can do it love
Make sweet music baby
Like only you can save me

[Verse 2]
I need more than your touch
Give me all you have to offer
I’m feeling you so much
That I might just meet you at the alter
Cross my heart hope to live
Happily ever after
It started with a kiss
That followed smiles and laughter
She liked my presentation
But now there’s hesitation
Hope there’s no reservations
If so I’ll just be patient
(Tic Tic Tic Tic)
What’s our next destination
Let me take you higher
With this sensual elevation

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Darling you’re so seductive
(Baby you’re so persuasive)
You are my one and only
For you there’s no replacement
Darling you’re so seductive
(Baby you’re so persuasive)
You are my one and only
For you there’s no replacement

[Bridge x2]

[Verse 4]
Waiting for the night to fall
Hoping that you might just call
I don’t want to fight at all
Without you there’s no life at all
Least not one that’s worth living
Impossible to envision
We move with such precision
That it is labeled forbidden
We inspire tension of the sexual persuasion
Now let me blow your mind like intellectual invasion
I need it I want it
Gotta have it at this moment
You got it and flaunt it
My heart & soul is haunted
