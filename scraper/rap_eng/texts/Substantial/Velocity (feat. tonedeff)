Can you feel speed coming? The beats humming
You need something to keep your knees buckling?
Keep frontin', you'll be duckin from these huntin' obese gunmen
Airing out these fuckin' MCs puffin', so breath some in
Each one of my words is just stunningly stern
And it's funny you learn through action, not example
That's exactly why I have to smack you
Learn that {smack, smack} Learn it again {smack} got it now?
Didn't ya know that Tonedeff can flow fast enough to mow Sonic down?
Well, I'm on it; shower your senses, power defenses up
If you don't wanna get offended, or else it's death and
A negative attendance in the census when I render you senseless
I'm the veteran that was sent with a vengeance
That's leaving you with a set of bent wrists
And a dented cleft chin, left with a horsejaw
Prolly gonna need a veterinarian or a dentist
Better get a move on; call U-Haul and troop on to Sioux Falls
With blue balls; you all really think you're ill?
Until we're just sharing the bill with you all and we're too raw
Who's stalling? Cause I done never held it back man
Step or take your last stand while we enact raps to packed jams
Idiot niggas, figure they're quicker 'til the maniac
Is leaving them with one shoulder missing like it's Flashdance
Can't stand these motherfuckers that can't rap
Tonedeff and Stan, instrumental like Sam Ash
Fuck a bitch until her pussy cat naps
Y'all niggas are pretty in pink
And you been chillin with the Brat Pack
Fact is, my stats kick your ass bitch
You're too average to consider surpassing
The task is tedious, really, this beat is just feeding me
You thought Gonzalez was Speedy!

Do you feel the need for speed?
Indeed ya do, we need ya to
Clear the way to speed ya through
Can you feel the velocity? Just hold tight
Bare witness to what future emcees will flow like

You're wacker than Ja Rule, we fast and furious like Vin Diesel
Ink penetrates the papyrus, my pen's lethal
Sookie, Sookie you rookie; goodie, goodie, we been evil
Fuck one-on-one! Tone and I take ten people
To even up the odds cause you and your friends feeble
Styles been played like movies with ten sequels
(Do you love hip-hop?) Does Eminem offend people?
Well, so do we, cause absolutely nothing's what you're showing me
Vocally magnificent; what you want is insignificant
In the big picture, bitch nigga, you're so sensitive
Gonna squirt some, I hurt one or two persons before the verse done
Your mom be sucking the girth numb, beat it up and made her cum
E Famm making you nerds run; when I get the mic, it's curtains
If you don't like it when your earth's done blow me homey
Hold that mouth full of cock sauce and a bozack
UV and E til I got wack that's never homey know that

Do you feel the need for speed?
Indeed ya do, we need ya to
Clear the way to speed ya through
Can you feel the velocity? Just hold tight
Bare witness to what future emcees will flow like

Do you feel the need for speed?
Indeed ya do, we need ya to
Clear the way to speed ya through
Can you feel the velocity? Just hold tight
Bare witness to what future emcees will flow like

Say what you want, but don't ever claim that you want it
Stay in the closet or you'll sustain so much pain
You'll vomit solid objects you never swallowed
Like hollow organs, you'll cough up dried esauphagus knots and notches
We're the marvelous two that are part of the crew
That came to astonish, The Plague is brolic
Scrape your face with abrasive cleanser, say that we're raining comet
Fame's a promise you'll never fulfill, I'll just set up the kill
Substantial lances in your neck, and sets your head on a hill
Really, for the world to see, everybody wanna get busy
Until they really gotta twirl with me; I score with ease
And floor your team I'm sure you dream of fuckin'
If weren't for your ball disease, you'd prolly skeez a broad or three
But all of 'em see that you ain't nothing but a poor MC
So, if you're looking for your pride, and a reason to die
In the blink of an eye, then keep in mind that they all with me
Now, hold your screams in, you don't wanna play in the court
The kings in From Newport to Kingston
I'll give you more defeats in wars than Normandy
Complete with hordes of soldiers beefin'
Keep your orders straight, cause sweepin me is more than fate could even orchestrate
Erasin more pieces of you than your whore's abortion takes

(Substantial, why you rap so slow?) I got asthma
Give me a second... lets see if I can rap faster
I'm smarter, harder; spit quicker, stronger
Even my dick's bigger, longer
In fact it sucks to be you, but what can we do?
You're a weaker, sweeter, poster-boy wussie
Who needs a hug cause you're pussy
You stank pot, thou reek of skank twat
My speech is flame; hot E weak? I think not
We link and bang spots, we drink to slain cops
Who were crooked; the little props I got? I fucking took it
Then spat on my doubters and shattered my cowards' glass jaws
By ripping up rap tours, whether little or no audience
Flip it a capella, even killed it to accordions
Not a battle rapper, backpacker, bitch-smacker thug
Just someone who could whip your ass but would rather show you love
So any further sleeping on me is not recommended
We'll never be fam if you haven't already been befriended
