VERSE 1
“It’s a man’s world” all about (him)
‘Cause, she cool but she not (him)
Ladies first only when she put there by (him)
Want her to take orders, never see her as a soldier
Hold up! Let me stop acting like I’m not him
Like I never womanized or undermined (her)
Want her how I wanted, where I wanted when I wanted her
In a home she made being treated like a foreigner
Taught she only valuable if she got (him)
And if she can have a baby boy by (him)
Future male chauvinist just like (him)
Would you want him for your daughter, how we plan on moving forward
In order for us to grow gotta stop (him)/me
From thinking that we’re better than or we own (her)
Of course our destinies coincide
So I gotta do better in my daughter’s eyes
So you know you gotta...


HOOK (JSOUL & Substantial)
Keep growing, baby
Keep growing, baby
‘Cause this world is yours baby
It’s your baby
Keep growing, baby
Keep growing, baby
‘Cause you’re so much more baby
Much more baby

VERSE 2
Had to raise a couple kids all without (him)
But employers never give her what they got (him)
Who get custody in most cases it’s not (him)
Forced to do it with less, always doing her best
But a good man, she lucky if she find (him)
Like the same don’t apply the day he find (her)
Would you drop everything so you could lift her up
Like she did for you every time you had given up
But you talking like she lucky that she not (him)
Traumatized her for life, they just shot (him)
Forced to find the strength to carry on without (him)
Knowing your son could face the same and unbearable pain
‘Cause she know what this cruel world thinks of (him)
What’s sadder is the world thinks less of (her)
We all should be mortified…
I pray we do better in our daughters’ eyes

HOOK

VERSE 3
Taught you couldn’t do that ‘cause it’s for (him)
TV showing less real you more (him)
Got raped, your fault, shouldn’t lure (him)
Like we ain’t got self control, all playing a roll
In violence against her done by (him)
Sad ‘cause I ain’t really care ‘til I had (her)
A lot dudes complacent, ‘cause most are raising their sons
What winner care about the losers when they’ve already won
Whether we talking race or battle of the sexes
Walking in their shoes, most valuable of lessons
Seeing what my daughter gotta carry and it’s heavy
Being black and woman, know we gotta get her ready
Glad I got a Queen by my side to help lead her
Love her more than life but some things I can’t teach her
Her foundation must be fortified
We plan to do right in our daughter’s eyes
