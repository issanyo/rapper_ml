[Hook]
So... so... so chill
So chill
So... so... so chill
So chill
Let them fall, let them fall, let them fall...
'Til they rise once more
Let them fall, let them fall, let them fall...
'Til they rise once more

[Verse 1:]
The Fall finally fell
Commencing the coldest winter ever
Slipping into a mighty slumber
Eventually Springing back into action
Only taking a seat in the throne it once occupied
After realizing that it was a Sum of her or his failures and triumphs
And when the sky is your only limit…
There is always room to grow
There is always room to grow
There is always room to grow

[Hook]
So... so... so chill
So chill
So... so... so chill
So chill
Let them fall, let them fall, let them fall...
'Til they rise once more
Let them fall, let them fall, let them fall...
'Til they rise once more

[Verse 2:]
So chill we put the bur in December
Ensuring your winter is cooler than the use so you’ll surely remember
How too dope this is
Like your first white Christmas or mistletoe kisses
Never had the latter but had my fam’s love
When we were a man down I managed to man up
In a cold world, ice age post mammoth
Hard not to slip, even harder to stand up
But I never been a fan of excuses
Made a couple but, as a man they are useless
Weight’s cumbersome but struggle has its uses
Many profit from and discover what their truth is
Blessing!
Til we return to the essence...
Remember that the greatest present that a father can give is presence
Til we return to the essence...
Remember that the greatest present that a parent can give is presence
