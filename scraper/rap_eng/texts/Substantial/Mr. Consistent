HOOK
Yo! All around the world they're (Falling in Love)
Yo! Even in my hometown now they're (Falling in Love) 'Bout time!
I'll take the award for "Mr. Consistent"
He's so persistent, no quit in'em
Yall can count on me!!!
VERSE 1
Please don't be alarmed, they say 3's a charm (yep)
But can't put it on your arm or around your (neck)
Put it on repeat when I get on beats (whoa)
There is no way to compete or complain (hell no)
Quality control, follow me I'll show (you)
Critically acclaimed legit is my name (duke)
You know this has been my aim from the top (too true)
Sure my hair's a little longer I'm a little stronger
Probably in a cipher if you catch me on the corner
Still no marijuana but I'm a little thinner
Might've lost a couple pounds but I still remain a winner
And I've been a bit outspoken like MLK on the mall
These lames names is Hanes because they stay on my balls
My main claim to fame put honor above all
I remain the same Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall... too thorough!
HOOK
VERSE 2
Plenty follow through, you know how I do (plan)
Quick to drop a jewel, still about the youth (man)
Hardly cockin' tools, I just pop & move (bam)
Quick to drop a fool long as I got two (hands)
Little bills like cockatoo but I could use Tou(cans)
If you're real we can barter dude as long you (fam)
I am cool, built to kick it like a soccer shoe (and)
I'm the truth while the doubters still ain't got a clue (damn)
HOOK
Sure, I stopped drinking and I cuss a lot less
But fuck around I'll play drunken master you put me to the test
More lover than a fighter but still nicer than average
You would think I had clones the way I be multitasking
You can call me captain or plain ole Stan
(Eh, cuz what's crackin?!) Same ole fam
'Cept a little more fresh, thankfully I'm not poor
Gave poultry a rest and I travel a lot more, overall
Not that much has change I am still the same (Sub)
I create w/ a passion, I'm try'na make (Love)
Perfect blend of heart and brain when I do my thing (bruh)
You look visibly in pain, beat bang (like uh!)
It's like a blank canvas with a beautiful frame (yep)
No limit to what I can do with the paint (son)
Thoughts blooming like it's Spring don't usually sing (but)
This here music's in my veins consistently mang, mang, ma-a-ang... I tried mama
HOOK
Can't stop, won't stop rockin' to the rhythm
