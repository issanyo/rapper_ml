[Hook – Cise Star]
‘Cause we climbing Jakob's Ladder
What's the matter?
Do what you have to just to make magic
Make them ends meet ‘cause life's so tragic
But yet we strive on, we don't get practice
Climbing Jakob's Ladder
What's the matter?
Do what you have to just to make magic
Make them ends meet ‘cause life's so tragic
But yet we strive on…

[Verse 1 – Cise star]
Sun is everyday magic, wonder in life: laughter
Disaster abounds when we refuse capture
We livin’ in the moment and on it go after
We think about tomorrow ‘cause sorrow is gonna happen
Lights from the camera, rework the action
We fight with the stamina just to please masses
Do what you got baby, you not an actor
It's real life holding a knife, stabbing the atlas
Flow tight, keeping me right, my mind wander
CYNE kept me going, but damn I run harder
Scared of success but can't handle failure
Worked with the best, but yet, I can't tell ya
Doubt keep me down, but clout give me ground
‘Round and around from hell to gold crowns
Highs to the lows, Seba Jun, he went home
God bless his soul.  To the stars he will go


[Hook – Cise Star]
‘Cause we climbing Jakob's Ladder
What's the matter?
Do what you have to just to make magic
Make them ends meet ‘cause life's so tragic
But yet we strive on, we don't get practice
Climbing Jakob's Ladder
What's the matter?
Do what you have to just to make magic
Make them ends meet ‘cause life's so tragic
But yet we strive on…

{Verse 2 – Substantial]
Heart of a lion, the lift of my mane and my pain are the same
Been a long road, carryin’ a large load
Pressure got me hunchback like Quasimodo
No pain no gain unless we speaking of interests
It's 4th quarter and it's 4th down and inches
Down by four, need a touchdown for sure
Man, I gotta win, so there's no point in kickin’ it
Second place prize is a death certificate
Coach said, “There's hell to pay,” if I don't play my part
Can't fail today, gotta make my mark
And I do my best.  Man, we been double stressed out like Tip and Phife Dawg
I really can't let my fam down
They’re the reason that I don't quit and I fight hard
But even with the planet on my shoulders
I keep an underdog mentality with champion composure

[Hook – Cise Star]
‘Cause we climbin’ Jakob's Ladder
What's the matter?
Do what you have to just to make magic
Make them ends meet ‘cause life's so tragic
But yet we strive on, we don't get practice
Climbin’ Jakob's Ladder
What's the matter?
Do what you have to just to make magic
Make them ends meet ‘cause life's so tragic
But yet we strive on…

[Verse 3 – Cise Star]
So please, get me started ‘cause life's a con artist
When you think it's all roses, you notice it's much harder
Needs to be protected, but some ready to sell it
Even cheaper than the things they desire—I don't get it
Hope I never will rebuild the New Deal
To help the common man, and damn, we gonna live
Struggle will make you humble and even grippin’ the muzzle
So help the less fortunate or we headed for trouble
A man not eatin’ is a man not dreamin’
If a man not dreamin’, then he might be schemin’
To get yours by any means and use force
‘Cause he ain't gonna starve while you eatin’ a full course
Not even finishin’, throwing it out, gigglin’
Remindin’ him of the CEO's of big businesses
Let's get it together, we not innocent
And take life back to the genesis
