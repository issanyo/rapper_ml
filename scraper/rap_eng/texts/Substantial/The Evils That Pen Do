[Hook] {X2}
It's The Evil That Pens Do, we can't help it
Over instrumentals, you get dealt with
Got you nodding your head, until your neck breaks
We're professionals, do what you do best, and spectate

[Verse 1: Tonedeff]
Now, who gets nasty like this on a regular basis?
Spent more time with a permanent pen than I ever did with erasers
I'm making these lame disgraces beg Eddie Murphy to trade their places
Curse their managers in church and disgrace their agents
Displaying the flagrant anger in me, in its raging stages
It's plainly outrageous…these cats is buggin like aphids
Been waiting to spray this in any face to face engagement
I be coming off of the cuff, leaving your girl with a pearl bracelet
I'm firm and invasive. You diss, the response is abrasive
I will warp your fuckin' mind, like Hunter Thompson in Vegas
And won't be stopping for ages
Kid, you're merit is gainless
The numbers speak for themselves just like alphanumeric pages
I'm out to replace the haste and poor taste that restrain us
With more signature lines in masterpieces than famous painters
You couldn't cut it close with a sheen tracer
When nobody's watching, I'll take over your set like a screen saver
Please see to your behavior
Tonedeff is ominous
Tearing out your heart just like bitches with broken promises
Honest, my rhymes will keep you in astonishment
(With) so many lines, I got geometrists with doctorates with postulates
But I'm on top of it, send 'em back to the lab
Kids be kickin' battle raps about the skills they don't actually have
So, I tactfully, polysyllabically, drastically stab em
With more lines than the amount of times that I've been asked to collab
With this masterful plan, put your balls in a sling
A Constant winner in the summer, even make comp fall in the spring
It's all in a blink, cause I be visionary
These are definitive times, yo, I hope you got your watch and dictionary

[Verse 2: Substanial]
Y'all cliché like old sayings role playing like thespians
You vagina fronting hard like a butch lesbian
You thought that we was done this is where the test begins
You feminine like estrogen riding the style like equestrians
This specimens invisible like ice cream trucks in winter
Contenders we get up in ya leave pussy straight tender
I'm warning ya suckers stay away if you're phonier
Than Milli Vanilli rocking a cubic Zerconia
No job rapper mooching off your mom rapper
Don't write lyrics you bite lyrics hard rapper
Battling to see who's wacker come back record rappers
Ending every line with the same word; rappers
Sound familiar never should you familia
You rap clowns could give me pat downs I wouldn't feel ya
Vicious is my behavior you're hoping your man saves ya
Cause I bring pain like wiping your ass with sand paper
Underground like a hermit as close as you come to perfect
Lyrically licensed to kill nigga you need a learner's permit
Simpleton I injure men from Washington to Michigan
Losers couldn't be like if our names were synonyms
Ill enough to get a quotable for my chorus
Cause this my world and you faggots are just tourists
Meanwhile piranhas bite my whole style verbatim
But them niggas ain't me that's exactly why I hate them

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Session]
With fantastic tactics you get your ass kicked
When I back flip and land heels first on your back, kid
Voice wrapped in plastic, when I spit it, explosive
Acidic, corrosive, you get it in doses
Battles? I'll have you shooting at me after
Charge my brain when I connect my nerves to nuclear reactors
Who can I be after, precisely laser guided
I catch burn on joints like arthritis when I write it
Getting excited, ya scared, grabs your guns tight
When I coughed, the sky divided, light blinded, GOD yelled guzuntight
I'll turn the market, wit hails of tunes
Learn your target and trail wit goons, burn your carcass inhale the fumes
I bring heat in battle, what you come up wit is dull
I'll drop your water percentage, vapors comin up from your skull
I'll heat the toast, and beat on most
I slay you dead on the spot and speak to ghosts
Fefeatin most with preachin notes
I spit bricks and lift tenements, grab mics rip an event
Hip hops fifth element
I hurt clowns, I don't push up I push the earth down
Go the full nine yards and still get the first down
On one play have bums layed when my tongue spray
And you can't come back like gettin stuck on a one way
Your lungs cave every time you try and rip tracks
You suck so much your throat muscles get snapped when you spit raps
So get back, you getting fucked for the last time like I dead slut
Wit the size of my ego I'll hit the world wit a headbutt
Step up, I got Tone, Stan, and Pack FM
While your rhymes is so pussy ya faggots attracting men

[Verse Four: Pack FM]
Its the Evils That Pen's Do, Ya rhymes will be used against you/
With the mic as my utensil, I write rhymes monumental
If I offend you, I meant to. When I'm on an instrumental
It's just so sentimental, Takin you back like a rental
Flippin scripts Like gymnastic actors, who practice back flips
On pissy mattresses, Knock worlds swallowed by Galactus off axis
Cats want to be as nice as Pack is, but they don't practice
You're just a wack bitch, You ain't surpising me
You're over rated, like Barney parental advisory
So why are these kids tryna be grimy and greasy
I'll fuck with you head, Not even eggs get over easy
These niggas be actin sleezy, gettin up in my face
Girls try to Touch Me and Tease Me, I dealt with the Case
You waste time, I lace rhymes with dopeness
For the MC's that quote this, I triple the dosage, call me the mic doc
Might rock the spot like after shocks
For niggas who been rhymin' twice as long, and still don't have half the props
You have to stop, your paragraphs make me laugh
Your whole crew can't even fuck with my faculty and staff
Send a memo to the sergeant, tell him fire up the squadrant
Got these garbage niggas chargin, sayin they'e butter when they're margarine
But they melt either way
I be the P the A
C the K, See the way I flow is out of the norm
Schoolin' kids like a college, you'll get housed like a dorm/
With a ratio of shady hoes, we got the crazy flow
With a Substantial amount of Sessions at Deff Radio
(It's Like That Bitch!)
