[Intro]
Now, if the greenbags don't stack large on my side of the yard
I ain't fucking with it
This cake has got to be all icing baby
Now I know I'm taking the biggest piece
But god damn I'm the biggest fish with the biggest mouth bitch
You wanna be rich right? (Hell yeah)
Well stick with me, do as I does, and be as I be

[Verse 1]
We be stackin chips, packin clips, mackin chicks
Laugh at tits, slappin dick, in yo' bitch (bitch!)
Makin hoes, take these clothes, from these sto's
Walkin slow, there go the po', now here we go
Parking lot to the spot, Marriott
Cause what I got to make a knot, is very hot
Who's at the do', go and check, I got the Tec
Tell him that you soakin wet, until he jet
Now lift up your fuckin dress, where's the rest
Bitch can hide a treasure chest, in her breasts
Uh-huh strip search, whip skirts
Uh-huh shit hurts, but it works bitch
You can jerk niggas but you can't jerk me
Ho I only tell you once that this dick ain't free
I'm talkin greed

[Chorus]
Greed, give me everything that I need
How you gonna deal with the niggas that I feed
Greed, give me everything that I need
How you gonna deal with the niggas that I feed
We smoking weed, you and me
Looking for that currency
We smoking weed, you and me
Looking for that currency

[Verse 2]
Now bitch niggas don't mean shit, from where I sit
Magnificent blow your back out, if you act out
Eighteen deep when the plane soar
The bitch threw her tits, asked my clique who we play fo'
Penetrate the clouds, loud, and obnoxious
Surround the airport with feds and helicopters
Escorted, detained and deported
Scared of the ly-rics, and when they bitches hear us
We the clear-est, you can fear us
Smile on the day of your dissapear-ance, smoke in mirr-ors
Break em all, pull over and jump out
Cause I can take em all, all bustas shake em all
I'm at the mall, buyin shit, like hot dog on a stick
These bitches all on the dick
Ice Cube ain't a lick (nope) make me bleed
And now you got to deal with the niggas that I feed, greed
Uhh uhh uhh (pigs squeal)
(Give me more, give me more) Greed, Greed

When you get your hands on it, wanna flaunt it
Wanna dance on it, everybody want it
When you get your hands on it, wanna flaunt it
Wanna dance on it, everybody want it

[Verse 3]
You punks is petty, still we steady, counting 'fetti
I'm the one closin escrow, with the best flow
(Do you wear a vest?) No
Niggas hit me I'mma turn into The Crow *caw caw* and take a shit
On everything counterfeit, the Don Mega
Blade Runner, in a beige Hummer all summer
It'd take about twelve honkeys, to convict
The nigga makin you sick, as the 12 Monkeys
Up in Detroit holdin weed court, all through the South
Picked up a ounce in Shreveport
My lead give head tunnels (boom!)
To any motherfucker disgruntled exit wound, look like a funnel
Worldwide, international jet set
My niggas love fuckin bitches that they just met
Get it wet, and you can do anything
When I'm in Paris niggas french-kiss the pinky ring

[Chorus]
Greed, give me everything that I need
How you gonna deal with the niggas that I feed
Greed, give me everything that I need
How you gonna deal with the niggas that I feed
We smoking weed, you and me
Looking for that currency
We smoking weed, you and me
Looking for that currency

[Outro]
Yeah, Ice Cube, trillionaire
I own a mansion and a yacht, haha
We do it like it should be does
Yeah, Westside niggas is very greedy, uhh
Death Row is very greedy
Sic-Wid-It records is very greedy
Dangerous Music greedy greedy greedy
Ruthless Records greedy, Suave House, greedy
So So Def, greedy
Rap-A-Lot greedy as fuck
No Limit, hah, hella greedy, uhh
Def Jam greedy, we all know Priority greedy as a motherfucker, hahaha
Hey got twenties on my BM, you still fuckin with a GM
What can you tell me, nigga?

*pigs squeal*
