[Intro]
Hell yeah! The Almighty E-A-Ski track!
I got my niggas MC Ren and Ice Cube on that Rebel Music

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Look at The Vill twenty-twenty
Weak ass niggas done fucked up plenty
Took the rap game, niggas wanted shit
When you with The Vill, make your ass pay the bill
Hope you niggas die twice when we overkill
Video hoes, y'all made 'em stars
Fuck your money, fuck your cars
Nigga, spit some hot bars
Wack motherfuckers out here tryna bust
You can trust me they are not hard
Hollywood-ass motherfuckers in here
Always acting like they some stars
If it ain’t ruff, nigga it ain’t the villain
Ren where you been? Homie, I’ve been chilling
Can’t believe how y’all fools let these wack motherfuckers in the building
E-A-Ski, MC Ren, yeah nigga I’m back again
Everytime I take a break
Garbage-ass niggas wanna be fake villains and put me back in
Y’all know what time it is
It can only be one villan
I'm about to hurt their feelings
Villains ain’t got no feelings

[Hook: MC Ren] x2
Throw your shit in the air
It’s that rebel music
Like you don’t fucking fucking care
It’s that rebel music
Ren about to put it down on fools right now
With that rebel music
It’s that rebel music, that that rebel music

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Ya’ll niggas know Ice Cube’s a rebel
Do you wanna know how I fooled the devil?
Already know that I’m down with Earvin
Don’t give a fuck about Donald Sterling
Niggas in Paris, Paris is burning
I'm here to exterminate the vermin
Pick them off like Richard Sherman
Straight Outta Compton here's a sermon
Ice Cube nigga praise the lord
If you don't wanna bow raise the sword
Turn your ass into smugglish broad
I'm the motherfucking chairman of the board
Ya'll bithces think I'm a hooligan
Cause I'm in a Benz with MC Ren
No motherfucker I'm a business man
Fuck you up with my business plan
Started off as an African, then I got hit with an American
Now motherfucker I hit a can, turned the world into Disneyland
Then I got scammed by the TSA, all they want is DNA
Changed the letters of USA, shit might as well say CIA

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
Rebel music, niggas off in these streets
Ain’t got shit to eat, rob your ass and fall asleep
To that rebel music, motherfuckers bust at police
Can’t be black and get peace, that brutality increase
These wack fools don’t cease putting that wack shit out
That bragging about that money shit, we can do without
Nigga watch your mouth, don’t forget I’m the villain
Nigga, I gave birth to y’all
Start to reach out to a few of y'all niggas
But I realized y'all wasn't worth the call
First of all, y’all shit be wack
Homies ain’t gon' tell you that
Especially when they kiss your ass and they smoking up your sack
Homie step to the back, villain coming
Still alwayz into something
Still all my shit bumping, while all y’all niggas all about nothing
West coast bomb, me and my nigga Ski
Me and my nigga be like me and my nigga E
Two hard motherfuckers that you can’t see
So don’t fuck with me, nigga this that O.G

[Hook] x2

[Bridge: MC Ren] x8
It’s that rebel music, that that rebel music

[Hook] x2

[Outro: MC Ren]
That's that rebel music
