This right here, is payback, from way back, I don't play that

This right here, is payback, from way back, I don't play that
This right here, is payback, from way back, I don't play that

[Verse 1]
Recognize a real Don
When you see one
And don't try to be one
You fuckin' peon
I been like Deion for eons
You ain't nuttin but a biotch
Messed around and let me re-up
I come back through and tear the street up
Ice Cube nigga you better D up
And when I come by bitch you better be up
Assss up face in the pillow
I don't give a fizzle got to do my thizzle
The only nizzle that I never ever fizzle
The original
You niggas know

[Hook]
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You, better get 'em up (come get some!)
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You, better get 'em up (come get some!)
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You, better get 'em up (come get some!)
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You better get 'em up!

[Verse 2]
Gotta get whichya
Hit you with these things that I'm holdin'
Who want to squab with the frozen
Now who want to battle with the chosen
You niggas lotion, I'm no emotion
I'm shrapnel from the explosion
Hit you in the face while you posin'
Hi it's Jimi Hendrix
I lined up ten dicks
And took out appendix
So go get forensics
Let 'em know I'm Geronimo
'Till it's my time to go
You better find your ho
Get ya babies and ya mama
And move to Guantanamo
Doubt my skills
I'm payin' my bills
I'm up in the hills
Ya niggas are kills
Even though I'm on a fucked up label
You bitches know what I can bring to the table

[Hook]
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You, better get 'em up (come get some!)
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You, better get 'em up (come get some!)
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You, better get 'em up (come get some!)
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You better get 'em up!

This right here, is payback, from way back, I don't play that
This right here, is payback, from way back, I don't play that
This right here, is payback, from way back, I don't play that
This right here, is payback, from way back, I don't play that

[Verse 3]
I like bitches like you
5'2" wearin' light blue
The freak get high too
With a fly doo
Notta erikah badu
That's lookin' for a "I do"
Now what can I buy you
Just to try you
Need another bitch to lie to
Need another bitch in my coup
Oh please can I trouble you
For a double scoop
A nigga need some T&A
Now you can get dick but you can't get no DNA
I heard you wuz a big freak (can I hang?)
Bitch looked down, I got some big feet
I like mike & ike's
I like watchin' dykes
I like goin' to fights
I like earnin' my stripes
In the book of life
It's only two women
Big ol' good ones
And good ol' big ones

[Hook]
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You, better get 'em up (come get some!)
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You, better get 'em up (come get some!)
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You, better get 'em up (come get some!)
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You better get 'em up! (come get some)
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You, better get 'em up! (come get some)
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You, better get 'em up! (come get some)
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You, better get 'em up! (come get some)
We gotta get 'em up (who wants some?)
You better get 'em up!
