[Hook]
The same ol' thing (All over the world)
The same ol' thing (Got to get wit' it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got...)
The same ol' thing (So let me tell ya 'bout it)

[Verse 1: Del]
MCs keep comin' with the same ol' thing
With the same ol' swing, with the same ol' ending
The same ol' climax 'cause many have no vertebrae
Yo, but D-E-L and Hieroglyphics have to murder a
Fraudulent foe real quick and get them off of our dicks
Show the public that they ass ain't slick
They lack skills, and they can only thrill ya by dance steps
I coulda iced Vanilla but I haven't got the chance yet
But that's okay 'cause he was dissed on Soul Train
He got booed because his rhymes are so lame
He ain't the only one, he's far from it
There's more on Earth and they're all gonna plummet
Like falling stars because a brother's in charge
I'mma stomp mud holes in they ass like they was El DeBarge
Then charge to the front of the class
Suckers everywhere like broken glass, yo
But I'mma keep troopin' through the Meadow with the fellow
Named X and a pillow, to sock the pussy willows
While I get dough as I grow as a rhymer
And they can keep showin' their teeth like Aunt Jemima
It's the same ol' thing...

[Hook]
The same ol' thing (All over the world)
The same ol' thing (Got to get wit' it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got...)
The same ol' thing (And it's gettin' kinda ancient)
The same ol' thing (All over the world)
The same ol' thing (Got to get wit' it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got...)
The same ol' thing

[Verse 2: Del]
I'm in your face with force to eliminate monotonous
Braggin' and boastin', so most will end up profitless
'Cause they ain't got a foot to stand on
And I'mma leave the stage bloodier than a tampon
I can't get no rest because of gang of little pests
Will step and try to test me with the same ol' thing
I wish it would stop but more than likely it will not
'Cause too many MCs got the same ol' thing
So I change and rearrange rhyme patterns
Keep ya mind scatterin', occur in solar system
And I still dissed 'em
The ones with the crumbs on they lips
Talkin' about Sucka MCs that don't exist
And I get the gist so don't play me like a imbecile
Thinkin' that ya large, but ya small as a thimble
Plus I get mental over funky tracks
And you still talkin' Sucka MC's? That shit is wack
If I ever dissed an MC it was one with a name
So don't tell me he was one in the same
Because I know better, I flow better than the average Joe
I use my Nubian stick to overthrow
That same ol' thing...

[Hook]
The same ol' thing (All over the world)
The same ol' thing (Got to get wit' it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got...)
The same ol' thing (And it's gettin' kinda ancient)
The same ol' thing (All over the world)
The same ol' thing (Got to get wit' it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got...)
The same ol' thing

[Verse 3: DJ Pooh + Rashad + both]
MCs out there got the same ol' thing, got the same ol' game
And trip, some got the same ol' name
Like Rockmaster This, Mighty Kingathat
Damn, who died and left you the Wolfman, Jack?
But the Boogiemen are irregular
Spectacular, Dracula, and plus we're gettin' clever
I never had the urge to ass a tag to my title
And I won't add a (rah) or a (huh) at the end of my recital
Hip hop hibbit
I never say a rhyme like that 'cause I can take my time and give it
Thought
So I went and bought
A pen and pad
Now I'm makin' MCs real mad
Like Young MC goin' out like Sugar Hill
Add a new beat, new rhyme, (huh) bogus still
And even if we are in the same gang it ain't no need
For all MC's to have the same ol' thing...

[Hook]
The same ol' thing (All over the world)
The same ol' thing (Got to get wit' it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got...)
The same ol' thing (And it's gettin' mighty ancient)
The same ol' thing (All over the world)
The same ol' thing (Got to get wit' it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got...)
The same ol' thing

The same ol' thing (All over the world)
The same ol' thing
(Repeat 4X)
