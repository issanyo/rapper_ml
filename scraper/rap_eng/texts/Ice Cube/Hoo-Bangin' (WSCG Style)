Gauges revolvers techs and millimeters
You know how we hoo-ride when we collide
Niggas run but they can't hide
Cause its world wide (Inglewooooooooooood!!)

Square ass niggas can't tell a ounce from a chicken

And you'll be dead if I pull this trigger

Blowed with a pocket full of weed

Steadily hoo slangin' out the blue Monte Carlo
Spitting hollows out my roscoe in packs as I blast
Getting my stalk on walk-on nigga waving my flag

Sack jacking purse snatching hoo-banging till I die

Cock the hammer back and all smiles turn to frowns
Bow down before you realize you out of bounds
