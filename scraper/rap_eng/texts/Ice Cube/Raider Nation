The Autumn wind is a pirate
Blustering in from sea with a
Rollicking song he sweeps along swaggering boisterously

The autumn wind is a raider, Pillaging just for fun
He'll knock you 'round and upside down
And laugh when he's conquered and won. (laugh)

Raider Nation (Let's Go Let's Go)
Raider Nation, Are you ready for some football?
You ain't ready for the football!

You ain't ready for them Oakland Raiders
It's the invasion of them Oakland Raiders
Are you ready for this football?
You ain't ready for this football. (ahhh)

Here we come baby, just win baby
Feel the storm of the cold autumn wind baby
It's the Oakland Raiders get cha mouthpiece
You in the black hole with the black beast
The same black gold, this is black silver
Commitment to excellence we deliver
And we'll play past regulation
It's the invasion of the Raider nation

[Hook]

You ain't ready for them Oakland Raiders
It's the invasion of them Oakland Raiders

Are you ready for this football?
You ain't ready for this football. (ahhh)

The Raider nation is united
When they see them pirates the fans get excited
The opposition get cryin'
When I hit the field
With my eye patch and my shield
The silver & black will attack
(are you ready for some football)
The silver & black will attack
(are you ready for some football)

Raider Nation, Let's Go Let's Go(4x)
Raider Nation, We are We are (4x)
Raider Nation
Just Win Baby (8x)
