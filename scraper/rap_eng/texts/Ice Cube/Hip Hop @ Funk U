What you know about the funk show
...this is X baby, X baby 
Funky, funky Bootsilla
Watch the boy play the Bass like Godzilla
Watch me pimp the mike like a gowiller
... when I go get her
Now try to kill when you see me with her
I make you feel just a little bitter
You can take a pill tryin' to feel better
Or you can ask Bootsy to help you get her
...
Dont you wanna get you down again
We wanna get down with Funk G
That's me
We have a Snoop Dogg Prodigy in the house but hey baby I didn't expect you'd be so young
Well you don't look so bad yourself
Oh and he's fresh too I like that
So what you wanna be when youre grown up sweety
I wanna be a rapstar just like Snoop Dogg
Aaw yeah, come on
You got to do it
Is Snoop calling . I got the P in me
Come on baby bubba
Slippin slidin, dippin glidin
Ridin to a whole new dimension
Its like playin some ball me and my doll
Jammin up on the yard
Get up of the wall you can smell it Snoopadelic, Funkatelic
They gonna yell it, we gonna sell it, y'all gonna buy
'cause youre all feelin the groove just say
One more rhyme, one more crime, one more time
Is all the same my brother my nilla is snoopin'
Bootsilla my name
You really losing I got the groovin ...
Ice Cube:
Get the ... watch ... all the .fantastic
Sing it ...
Sing it back we got . we got style
Sing it ...
Recognize son, as you drop it on the one
We just getting started, I beg your pardon
Recognize, people, where the peace comes from
Pay attention in the music cause this is it
Salute to get with it
So youall never quit it, its a beautiful thing
And before ya'll spit it
Its a natural high you can't get over it
Bass so low you got a lover from livin' it
Your funk will be unlocal 'cause this is global
Dont be just be doin it just to get paid
Or just to be fakin' it to just get laid
Dont be afraid to take it to the stage
Just look what we lost this millenium age
Michael Jackson, James Brown and Isaac Haze
Denny Berry, Lutha Lina Nina, JMJ and Rick James
We got to live up to the names
Flyin from my home town
We just gonna get down
...
Its Bootsy baby
Gotta have it
You got to do it
Los Angeles, California ...
