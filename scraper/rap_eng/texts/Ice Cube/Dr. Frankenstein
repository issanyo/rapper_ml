Supreme gangsta shit
We dream gangsta shit
*rain pouring* Yes *electric shock, beaker tingling*
Yes *knock on dorr*
Yeah what is it? *continual knocking on door*
What is it?!? (Doctor, is everything alright?)
Yes, I'm straight, go to bed *thunder claps*
*animal screams* Yeah! Yeah!
*woman screaming* It's ALIVE!

[Ice Cube]
It's pourin rain, thunder and lightning
Clash of the titans, I'm home writin
Gangsta rap has arrived, I'm the only man alive
October 31st, 1985
Hard times, just got harder
Adolescent Ice Cube, the shit starter
A martyr, thanks to the father
For bein this mean as sixteen raps, feel like the bitch scream
You learned about your triple beam from me
You stopped payin for pussy and hit that ass for free
A little G never thought, that I could change the world
Witta attitude, a Raider jacket and a jheri curl
Got every girl wantin to do me, screw me
Boyz N The Hood, the first rap, the first movie
Oooh wee *woman screaming* it's alive
So whatchu gon' do 24/7, 365
Dr. Frankenstein
Dr. Frankenstein

[Mr. Short Khop]
Ooooh wee, it's alive
You better run and hide
Cover your ears and your eyes
Ooooh wee, it's alive
You better run and hide
Cover your ears and your eyes

[Ice Cube]
The world had to bow to this new style
Dial 9-1-1, makin more money than the law allow
But Fuck Tha Police, they can get deez
Now who was sayin shit like that before me?
No-body, but everybody wanna take the star's place
And be Scarface in the car chase
Illigitimate, counterfeit
Even got white boys talkin shit off the shit I invent
No no, motherfuckers musta took a photo
Tryin to call my gangsta shit 'mafioso'
But who ya usin? Fool it ain't no solution
To the evolution, of pimps and prostitution
I cuss, scandalous, I give a rush
To niggas who mind turn to mush, smokin on brush
Hush, I'm just a lush for this Hen
Chrome electroids, connected to my pen
When, blowin motherfuckers ain't knowin what we goin through
Spiritually, lyrically showin you
They call me, 'AmeriKKKa's Most Hated'
Gettin liberated by this monster I created
Dr. Frankenstein

[Mr. Short Khop]
We love to bump you Frankenstein
Yo' shit is the best
Take my body and my mind
Don't fuck with the stress
Hit me with that game to win
If you want, hit me again
We love you Frankenstein
We love you Frankenstein

[Ice Cube]
Now how many times did a nigga have to warn ya?
Ya fuckin up the formula (call the coroner)
It's outta hand, cos sucker ass niggas like you
Try to pay the rent off my blueprint
New cent to the industry
You thought my shit was biodegradable, uh uh, it's unfadeable
Unstoppable, runnin through your suburbs
Incredible thug words
We gets down, nigga do the Monster Mash
And watch a nigga like me collect monster cash
Cos I'm sittin wit this bitch who got monster ass
Keep em wonderin how long the Don will last
And never pass, and when I want it buttered on toast
Can't no nigga see Ice Cube on no coast
So all you gotta do is focus
And see that I'm the fuckin loccest with this hocus pocus
Dr. Frankenstein
Dr. Frankenstein, ugh

[Mr. Short Khop]
Ooooh wee, it's alive
You better run and hide
Cover your ears and your eyes
Ooooh wee, it's alive
You better run and hide
Cover your ears and your eyes
Ooooh wee, it's alive
You better run and hide
Cover your ears and your eyes
Ooooh wee, it's alive
You better run and hide
Cover your ears and your eyes
