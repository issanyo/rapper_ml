(I'm gonna get you high today)
[Verse 1]
Relax facin, facin mind-bogglin hallucinations
Eazy-Duz-It till the skull get your lungs full
Take a deep pull, react sit back cos Mack
Got that bu-yow shit that get'cha higher than wick-wack
It's hard as stone alone, it's always on
Never home-grown totin cos the streets made me potent
Down since '84 now live for '95
Got it swingin while some niggas bangin, I'm dope slangin
For my everyday expenses, know the consequences
The bigger the sack, the bigger the sentence
No time for repentance, put it down
Count the stripes that I tally
Runnin backstreets and alleys through Inglewood, Cali
So back the fuck up, don't act the fuck up
Never slip from the hit
Triple-six in the clip when I trip
So busters beware, never dare to have qualms
With that nigga Mack 10 full of ghetto ass bombs
Take a hit

Chorus:

Can you feel it nigga? Nothin can save ya
Roll ya papers and take a heel on my shit
*repeat*

Get'cha high like a rocket, loot in my pocket
Mean like the green, bomb like the chocolate
Thai, I Mack 1-0, gun-ho
Dirty ass Lynch Mob crew, new voodoo
Cast a killer, cap peeler, hang with gorillas
Tragic when you catch it, runnin from my magic
TAADOW! New Jackin got it crackin like Nino's
Stackin like casinos, bomb like the primos
Make your crack dough black, attack like karate
Always beamed up like Scotty, I control your body
Leave ya numb, red rum, slug like a Dodger
Nothin bomber than this Westside ghetto ganja
Hundred proof pure dopeness and it seems
Heavy as a Chevy, too much for a triple beam
Fiend for the microphone, one pop ya drop
And it don't stop, I can't stop
Mack 10 and I won't stop
So take a hit (I'm gonna get you high today)
Shiit! (I'm gonn get you high today)
Shiit!

Chorus

Got that one-hitter quitter shit so take a whiff
Need a torch to light my spliff, work the late night shift
Get my drift? Had it sewed up ever since I showed up
Cookin up boulders, got a crew full of soldiers
Claimin B's, claimin C's, everybody Gs
Went from laces to Deez, from mo' C's to ki's
What you need guaranteed to whip and leave ya trippin
Like your sane, I sippin, funky germ dippin
Make you tweak, lose sleep, I creep like a phantom
Ran em then I win em, all up in em like venom
Got the lotions, slow motion, hit the magic potion
Don't panic, satanic, devotions, convulsions
Wipe your whole crew out, niggas get blew out
Hides behind a stockin while the bomb's tick-tockin
Keep rockin and it don't quit, it's Mack 10 the shit
So press your luck but'cha know you can't fuck wit it
Take a hit
