[Ice Cube]
Ice Cube motherfucker with my nigga C. Toones
The C stand for Crazy, yeah nigga we loons
And we been saggin, before Bin Laden
Been braggin 'bout his first underground cabin
And you been faggin, like a Sisqo dragon
Tail waggin, San Francisco actin
Come through lookin 6'8, makin' bitches wait
Can't believe that nigga Cube is on a mixtape
But only large niggas dictate, where they rhymes go
As time go watch yo' mind blow
If not I'll let my nine go, like a rhino
It'll slump ya like whino
Little homies call me El Grando
Cube Calico, you can go toss a salad hoe
Better yet, you can get the dick mayne
The shit mayne, and don't you forget mayne...
