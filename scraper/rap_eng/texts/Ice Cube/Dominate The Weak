[Intro]
Wake up homie
Hey
The people, they coming
Listen
Wake up
Ay homie
You got get up
Them folks is at the door man
Get up
Get up

[Chorus]
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak

[Verse 1]
This ain't paranoia, this is California
Best believe mothafucka that they coming for ya
Got the place surrounded, don't know how they found it
Man fuck that money, ain't no time to count it
Gotta get to movin', only God can save us
This is the day they try to re-enslave us
Grow my hair long, Angela Davis
So I can get recognized by the space invaders
Storm troopers, have you heard the latest?
They'll treat your living room like the Oakland Raiders
Take all your books, you ain't patriotic
You psychotic, your neighbors call you neurotic
Put you on the news and tweet bout ya
These bitches won't say nothin' sweet about ya
Can I get a witness? (Now) Can't get a witness (now)
Just brainwashing mothafuckas is a dirty business

[Chorus]
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak

[Post-Chorus]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up

[Verse 2]
Why you on that Xbox? They closing in
You'll believe me when that front door is blowing in
They going in and they'll tackle everybody
Grandmama, grandbaby, shackle everybody
Interrupt your party, put down your drinks
And they'll blow your nose off like the fucking Sphinx
Catch you by surprise, around sunrise
When I go to sleep, I sleep with one eye
I sleep with one nine, I sleep with booby traps
And my dogs don't fuck with no Scooby snacks
I'm die hard, I brought the movie back
Some of y'all try hards, some of y'all don't do that
Some of y'all dumb as rocks, some of yâ€™all sharp as a tack
Some of y'all clowns, some serious as a heart attack
I'ma fuck the police, nigga yea I started that
Some of y'all scary niggas, come and be apart of that

[Chorus]
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak

[Post-Chorus]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up

[Verse 3]
Underwater flow, shit is getting deep
Them fuckas tried to down the aqua boogie freak
But I'm an octopus, especially when I got to push
When shit is fishy, my trigger finger get itchy
All you sissies, I'm a general like Ulysses
Fuck with me, I'm incredible like Bill Bixby
I never sleep, cut off my eyelids
Insomniac, maniac, I'm a hybrid
Bitch I'm a pirate, they call me Blackbeard
I sail the seven seas, ho, I'm off the grid
It's the ultimate, baby I'm the bulk of it
The whole package, a nigga with no baggage
It's kinda tragic when you driving through Irvine
Is this Germany 1939?
I'm a gangsta boy, not the nerdy kind
They gotta dirty mind, all about the dolla sign

[Chorus]
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak

[Post-Chorus]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
