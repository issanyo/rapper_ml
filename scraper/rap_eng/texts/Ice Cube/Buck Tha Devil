[Ice Cube]
Damn, I'm sweatin like a nigga at a white woman funeral
"Lench Mob.."
"Civilize a 85er"
Huh, break 'em off somethin'
"Lench Mob.."
"Civilize a 85er"
Come again, huh
"Lench Mob.."
"Now we come to the pay-off"
"Lench Mob.."
And here we go with verse one, J-Dee
"Civilize a 85er"

[Verse 1]
Buck the devil, buck the devil, buck the devil - boom
Give the nigga, give the nigga, give the nigga room
Must be a full moon, here comes a tune
Bullets fly by your head zoom-zoom-zoom

A to the K to the 4 to the 7
Little devils don't go to heaven
Last night I shot eleven at the record shop
Most of 'em dropped when my 9 went pop

Damn, see the fuckin' cop with the flat-top
Standin' over niggas face down on the blacktop
That shit's gotta stop, so I kick the hip-hop
Pop that devil in his ass and make him flip-flop
Flip-flop, flip-flop back when I talk back
Now his name is Stucky Mack, tryin' to fuck a black
In fact I got the 411, so you can buy a gun
Lench Mob's got the devil on the run, down with King Sun

And we bring fun to all ages
Short Dog got the motherfuckin' gauges
Shootin' through yellow pages
That's why whitey wanna catch us in cages

But no, no, no, I don't think so
Shorty joined the nation, and he don't drink no mo'
Show 'em how to eat the lip and how to beat the shit
Out of a devil see a brother he's agreed to give
Asalaam alaikum, shake 'em, and whitey can't fake 'em
And if they try F.O.I. will break 'em
(Well alaikum salaam and I'm calm
(Ice Cube drop the motherfuckin bomb!) There it is yo..

"Lench Mob.."
"Down with Farrakhan.." -] Chuck D
"Gotta let 'em know the devil's a conniver" -] Puba
(repeat all 2X)

[Verse 2]
The devil hates, the devil hates, the devil hates my skin
Because I'm original, so please tell a friend (yo)
But who will win in the end?
That's whitey's in the sun tryin' to blend with the black men
(But we'll check the blue eyes, contacts ain't wise
Cause different color eyes get chastised)
So can I get a witness, work on your fitness
And be sure to put the devil on your shit list
Y'all can't miss this, a brand new LP
From the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B
(No I'm not your Toby, just like you told me
Just found out I'm the O.G.)
(Never caught the holy ghost, sorta like you do)
Just like X-Clan relyin' on my voodoo
(Who you?) (One flew) (over the cuckoo nest)
Now I guess that you think you're blessed
(Get that fuckin' cross off your chest
Can I Kick It like A Tribe Called Quest?) YES!
The devil hates, the devil hates, the devil hates my crew
So let the nigga, let the nigga, let the nigga through
But fuck you too and your red white and blue
Motherfucker you through -- so act like you knew
(Shoot you with my twenty-two!) I got plenty crew
(I take out white boys that's scary) (BOO!)
Yeah I'm the nigga that said it
And I'm sorry that I can't regret it
But it's a proven fact that Jack is anti-black
SO HERE'S YOUR FUCKIN' PAYBACK
(I'm with the..)

"Lench Mob.."

"Gotta let 'em know the devil's a conniver" -] Puba
"Lench Mob.."
"Buck buck buck the devil" -] Ice Cube
"Gotta let 'em know the devil's a conniver" -] Puba

[Verse 3]
I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin'
(Bullets, hummin') Devils, runnin'
(Niggas, gunnin') Many, done in
(Looks, stunnin') (Now to kick the fun in!)
BUCK THAT DEVIL -- come again black man
BUCK THAT DEVIL -- come again black man
BUCK THAT DEVIL, BUCK THAT DEVIL
BUCK THAT DEVIL, FUCK THAT DEVIL!
Armageddon is a confrontation
That's the information comin' from the Nation
So what you gonna do with your crew or your boys
Will you just sellout, or bring the noise?
(Keep your boys cause we got big toys
With the one mile scope, takin' whitey's throat)
(Why, cause he made me ride a boat?)
A lot of us died at float, and you can quote
From the L.M., run run run run run and tell them
With they devilish ways and they pale skin
(that the motherfuckers'll never win!)
(YEAHHHHH, AND IT'S LIKE THAT!) HAHAHAHAHA!

"Lench Mob.."
"What's Goin On?"
"Gotta let 'em know the devil's a conniver"
"Lench Mob.."
"What's Goin On?"
"Gotta let 'em know the devil's a conniver"
"Lench Mob.."
"What's Goin On?"
"Gotta let 'em know the devil's a conniver"
"Lench Mob.."
"What's Goin On?"
"Gotta let 'em know the devil's a conniver"
