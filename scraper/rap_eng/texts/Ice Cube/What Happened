Intro:
[Notorious B.I.G]
The Fuck Happened to the home of the brave
Niggas running off headed to the grave
Black president, don't matter
Shit just getting worst life is shattered
A land of freedom is flipping out
All I want is a life without a doubt

Verse 1
[Ice Cube]
Thug life, we all been through it
Life's a struggle though it's not split
Illuminati or whatever the fuck they go by
They the reason why the world so dry
I'm just a nigga tryna live my life
Everyday staying away from the tip of a knife
Or the the fire from a fucking 9 millimeter
This damn Gangasta life is that of a cheater
I'm starting to think we living in a trash can
Jus' waiting to be swallowed up bu the Klu Klux klan

Verse 2
[Notorious B.I.G]
Every night sleeping with a common dream
That everyone be on the same team
When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God'll prolly have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fucking abortion

Verse 3
[Ice Cube]
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst
Bitch how could this get any worse than it is worst
America might as well be cursed
