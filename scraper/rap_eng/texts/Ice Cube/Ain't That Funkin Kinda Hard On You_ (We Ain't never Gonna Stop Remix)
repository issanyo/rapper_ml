[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Two tears in a bucket I'll cry with ya, huh
But I can never lie with ya
I can never afford not to afford
I can never put my plans to the side with ya
I can never see a red light
Like a deer with a head light
I freeze up when I re-up
See I really have patience
If you relatin', only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it
The reason why I never went to work for it?
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didnâ€™t hurt me
You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intention
They say time heals all
But if I could short cut my success motherfunk all y'all
What's up

[Verse 2: George Clinton]
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
I was hard when I started
I'll be hard when I get through
For example if I had to sample some funk like you
Would I be funky too?
And another thing
It ain't so hard, it ain't so strange
If I could be funky like you
If I could be funky like you

[Hook 1: ?]
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
He was hard when I started, said he going to be hard when he get through
He was hard he started, he going to be hard when he get through

[Verse 3: Ice Cube and George Clinton]
By the way  I treat her
You know if I need her
See, Dr. Funkenstein
That's my spiritual leader
Some suckers don't like it
Cause I'm a psychic
And if you tricks don't like it
Hoe, you can dyke it
It's that self-made Kool-Aid
Look what red and blue made
Turned O'Shea into N.W.A
Triple OG, ain't never sold the key
Ain't never did time, they still respect mine
Ask all the nigga's, on the main line
Who they favorite, and what he's made with
Playboy, I ain't nothing to play with
I'm dangerous when it come to using this language
Me and star child, we talk to strangers
All the real hoods are ready to bang this
You might not understand if you came from Cambridge
I'm flashing blood, that's hard as stainless
Yeah yeah
It's good to be hard
It's good to be hard, homie
But damn
It's hard to be good
It's hard to be good

[Hook 2: George Clinton & (Kendrick Lamar)]

I say, "I was hard when I started, gon' be hard when he get through"

[Hook 1: ? & (Kendrick Lamar)]
Brothers be like
"George"
(Two tears in a bucket)
"ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
He was hard when he started, and he'll be hard when he get through
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
He was hard when he started, and he'll be hard when he get through
He was hard when he started, and he gon be hard when he get through

[Outro: ?, (?), Kendrick Lamar & George Clinton]
Ain't that funkin' kind hard on you?
Ain't that funkin kinda hard
Yeah
Ain't that funkin' kind hard on you?
Since when did the funk become [?]
(Baby, been funkin for so long)
Shit, ain't [?]
(Hey-y-y-y)
Ain't that funkin' kind of hard on you?
See, Dr. Funkenstein
(I'm still funkin' for fun)
Two tears and a bucket
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?
(I've been doing it from the start)
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?
(We ain't never gonna stop)
Two tears and a bucket
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?
(Never, never stop, no, no
Never stop, no, no)
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?
(No, no
Never stop
No, no, no
Never, never, never stop)
