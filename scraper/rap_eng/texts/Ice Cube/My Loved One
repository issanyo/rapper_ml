Nigga ain't tryin' to do too much

All I wanna do is have fun with my loved ones (yaaeyae)
Spend a hun' on my loved ones (yaeeyae)
Make a run with my loved ones
My relatives & my cousins
(repeat w/)

I like to get down with my peoples & my folks
My dogs & my locs the room filled with smoke (brr)
I got these Crip niggas talkin' to the Bloods
& niggas ain't spreadin' slugs but spreadin' love (yeah)
It's the thang we do since ' 92
What's the use of you killing me & me killing you?
We at the picnic off the liquid
We the illest in town & nobody gets sick
Heard these freaks don't get along
Cause one hair is short & one's is long
The dick don't care 'bout no hair
What you talkin' 'bout? We can work it out
When you with me nigga all the drinks on the house

All I wanna do is have fun with my loved ones
Spend a hun' on my loved ones
Make a run with my loved ones
My relatives & my cousins
[S.K.] What you wanna do?
All I wanna do is have fun with my loved ones

[Cube]
Oh you wanna pay the price
I'm like Poltergeist when I get ya dice
I make 'em do thangs
Man I got the Method like Wu-Tang
Have you niggas changin' like mood rings
So we should kick back on this six pack
Where them bitches at with the fifth of yak (cognac)
(Oh they went to get some food too)
I know the people that you came with
& hang with but who's you?
[S.K.]
They call me Short Khop
I'm the nigga in the bathroom with
2 bitches & the do' locked (You??)
I know you famous & I must be buzzin'
But can't nobody give head like yo' cousin (ah fuck you)

All I wanna do is have fun with yo' loved ones
Spend a hun' with yo' loved ones
Make a run with yo' loved ones
Yo' relatives & yo' cousins (ha haa)
(What you wanna do?)
All I wanna do is have fun with yo' loved ones

[Cube]
Now be careful on yo' way home
You know it's on with the police
They can't see a nigga get no peace
They pull you over never carin' if you drunk or sober
They wanna fuck with yo' nuts
Call yo' baby momma sluts put you in cuffs
In the Afterworld yo' ass gon' get touched
We see you later workin' for them haters
Fuckin' space invaders comin' up the elevators
To 304 damn that's my suite
Why you bammin' on the fuckin' do' & holdin' heat
Bring yo' ass in come on have a seat
We can meet over somethin' to eat
Muthafucka
