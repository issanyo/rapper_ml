[Intro: Ice Cube]
Yo what's up?
Official T-shirt nigga
Hood certified
Dub Sizzle

[Chorus 1: WC]
Where my, where my, where my hustlers at?
Where my, where my, where my hustlers at?
Where my hustle is at, where my hustlers at?
Babies give give give money. Throw their hands up

[Verse 1: WC]
Sixteen in the chamber with a stack between my fingers
Geto Boys, NWA, Schooly D in the CD changer
Reclining like The Mac, swoop on the ave
Cruise the block like a float in a parade in a seven and a half
Sitting low [?] so [?] to the Pro Fitted
Hustler, hustler, nigga all I know is a goal get it
Ah, ah, ah the flow is so wicked
Strip for me baby, slide down this chocolate pole and grip it
Going all out for the dough, ball out and roll
Dub keep it G, nigga this hood shit is all I know
Got the dice [?] up, my ice cleaned up
Now I cater the streets like the weed man out of the ice cream truck
Diamonds on my neck shining in the club like daylight
Dub C be hitting it right, by the end of the night you be saying "all right"
22 is the inches, 69 is the position
Lench Mob and gangsta shit, money's my addiction, nigga

[Chorus 2: Ice Cube]
Well you 'bout to bow down when you see a OG
Coming straight out the hood it's my nigga WC
Well you 'bout to give it up but we do you ugly
We addicted to it, gettin' closer to it

[Chorus 1: WC]
Where my, where my, where my hustlers at?
Where my, where my, where my hustlers at?
Where my hustle is at, where my hustlers at?
Babies give give give money. Throw their hands up

[Chorus 3: WC and Ice Cube]
I'm addicted to green that don't burn
Up in the kitchen without a concern
Mothafuckas will learn it's my turn
I'm addicted to it, getting closer to it

[Verse 2: WC]
Making it bounce, making it bounce, chrome frame making it bounce
I know girls like money so I'm sticking them and dicking them now
Dick in their mouth putting a dick in their mouth with a .44 on me sticking out
Windows getting foggy while we doing it all night doggy style
Acting up run the weed up, jag in cup, G'd up
Fucking it up my Chucks moving and doing my new dance while I'm holding my n-eez-uts
Back down then side to side I skip skip throw my dubs up high
Running around South Central bottom with a bandana on my steering column
Slap boxing, dominoes, jail breakers squatting low
Switching up and our fly S5 on mine, middle finger out the window with one time
Riding when I beat up on the concrete I be sliding when I get up on a bitch their eyes get
Wide and when they see me sagging and lagging them, Lench Mob medallion
Blinding them. Hood screw up your stars and it ain't no killing ours
Still the stars whoop your ass for the cash, yeah, I'm guilty as charged
Quarter pounds, assholes, whatever you need best believe don't trip
If the price is right I take a trip for flip and get them [?]by one zip for zip
Sitting on but I'm dipping on but I'm tipping on nigga getting it on
With a freak on the side of me sipping Patr√≥n trying to whip it on, baby licking my bone
And I'm starting to moan cause them lips are long and I can see me getting my pimping on
And she tripping on but I'm twisting on my swap meet corduroy slippers on
Cause I'm real with this, I was built for this, nigga muthafucking WC is still the shit
And I ain't leaving until I get another meal in this, so every time I spit it I'm killing shit
So nigga dig a ditch, get out the wilderness, I'm hood-certified and still with this
When will I quit? Oh, fuck it nigga, I ain't quitting until I'm filthy rich

[Chorus 2: Ice Cube]
Well you 'bout to bow down when you see a OG
Coming straight out the hood it's my nigga WC
Well you 'bout to give it up but we do you ugly
We addicted to it, gettin' closer to it

[Chorus 3: WC and Ice Cube]
I'm addicted to green that don't burn
Up in the kitchen without a concern
Muthafuckas will learn it's my turn
I'm addicted to it
Getting closer to it

[Chorus 1: WC]
Where my, where my, where my hustlers at?
Where my, where my, where my hustlers at?
Where my hustle is at, where my hustlers at?
Babies give give give money. Throw their hands up
Where my, where my, where my hustlers at?
Where my, where my, where my hustlers at?
Where my hustle is at, where my hustlers at?
Babies give give give money. Throw their hands up
