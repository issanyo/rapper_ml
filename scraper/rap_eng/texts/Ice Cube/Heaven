Verse One:

Listen to the preacherman
But are you talkin' to me
I can't hear you with a mouth full of pig's feet
If I should need the swine flesh
Your body is a mess, but you're blessed
With a father, son, spirit and the holy ghost
But my whole neigborhood is comatose
Lookin' for survival
The devil made you a slave and he gave you a bible
400 years gettin' our ass kicked
By so-called christians and catholics
But I watch 'em burn in a fire
See I'm a g, that's why I ain't in your choir
Cause I see, cause I know
The church ain't nothin' but a fashion show
Get the devil to a 187
And they won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven

Verse Two:

You're waitin' for the devil to come from the ground
Clown, take a look around
Just look at the cross that the priest is holdin'
A beast in sheep's clothing
But I'm rollin' with that knowledge of self
Cause heaven ain't just wealth
So mister preacher, if I couldn't pay my tithe
Do I have to wait outside?
White man, please take another look
Cause we couldn't be readin' out of the same book
Cause youse a crook and I'm a brother
King James had sex with his mother
Is that your edition? Is that your religion?
Black man, you gotta make a desicion
Cause God is comin' on day number seven
And he won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven

Verse Three:

The same white man that threw me in the slammer
He bombed the church in Alabama
So if I cock the hammer, God won't mind
If I have to kill the human swine
Cause God is a killer from the start
Why you think Noah had to build his ark
And God is a man from his feet to his hair
That's why you say 'amen' after each and every prayer
I just stare at the church man
Spendin' more money on the church band
But Elijah's got a plan
Got the white man screamin': 'Damn that Farrakhan!'
Cause one day these babies are uprise
Much more than bowties and bean pies
Kickin' knowledge at 7-11
And they won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven
