"Oooh, oooh, pissin' on your steps..."

[Verse 1]
It's D-E-L tha Funkee Homosapien to the rescue
I'm solo and threw a bolo and left two
Dancers back on Soul Train
And ya know Soul Train get the phat doodie stain
Now what ya gonna do with the board with no talent
Using step 1 and step 2 to keep the show valid
Let's have a vote and try to register our ballots
And realize a Hammer's just a mallet
Toss him like a salad cause he ain't truly gifted
Now the party's lifted by the crew Hieroglyphics
Golly-wolly, not another Elvis and Priscilla
Ice is cool, but I can't stand Vanilla
Because he takes a style and tries to mock it
Ain't nothin' personal, G, but I'm kinda into chocolate
It's all about the black, and it's like that
And I'm so laid back cause I smoked a phat sack
Plus I'm almost through & done with a whole 40-dog of Olde English 800
Now I peep ya concept
Ya think ya got a rep?
Dance all day, while I'm pissin' on your steps

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
No Del is not a mean fellow
Just because I wanna turn your dance shoes yellow
See I'm rather mellow, some call it lazy
Me and myself and I ain't with the daisies
Cause I'm no goddamn flower
And every single dancer in circumference receives a golden shower
I'm here to insult
The Hip hop John Travolta
Ya think ya all that but really you're shorter than a midget
I don't fidget
With the ballet
[Ice Cube:] Fuck a dancer [Del:] Because that's what my pals say
And brothers don't shake ya rumps
Wearin' biker shorts is like chokin' on ya nuts
Because ya might end up with a cramp or a hernia
And that's much worse, than a fine girl burnin' ya
Plus it ain't fly for you to have your behind
Blasted all out like a feline
See I'm givin' you advice, make ya think twice
Cause dance groups don't last past Minute Rice
So change ya concept
Acquire some skills on the mic while I'm pissin' on your steps

[Hook]

[Outro]
"I gotta take a leak for the weak..."
