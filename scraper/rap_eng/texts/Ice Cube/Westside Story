I never did like a mark
And you can ask my momma, all my niggas had drama
Coming from the W.S., go the length
And doing more dirt than Tide with extra strength
You can ask the people that I fucked with
Not one of them ever got their duck sick
Punk, I ain't gonna blow ya
Cause The Hunt for the Red October is over
And if I let you slap it, flip, rub it
You'll love it, my shit'll have you pussy whipped
I remember the time my nigga had a G-ride
Looking like the Westside Bonnie & Clyde
Yep it was a Cutlass
And he'll knock your ass straight out like Dick Butkis
So I'm down with the G
When all those other girls would've went out like a bad knee
I never did, punk
Even with a chicken in the trunk, smelling like skunk
About to do a drop-off
So he can go get some Daytons with the knock-offs
And if you think I'm slippin' you're trippin'
Yep, I got it going on plus I'm dippin'
Never did like the marks, cause marks just bore me
I'm coming with that Westside Story

[hook]
(Throwing up the Westside G-Ride hoo ride!)
(You can run but you can't hide from the Westside)

You say you want a gangsta bitch like Apache
Yo Yo's in the house, you can't match me
Huh, whatever
Smoking more blunts than Cypress Hill and Cheech & Chong put together
See I'm still rolling and I thought you knew
What the fuck do I do, the Sherriff, us, or you
Shit goddamn the man and Yo-Yo never was a fan of Silver Brand
I need to retire
He came up to my window and asked "Where's the fire?"
I showed a little thigh, batted my eye
And then got away with a few lies
And when I let my hair blow
All that fool can say is "Drive careful"
Never did like a mark, cause marks just bore me
I'm coming with a Westside Story

[hook]

Now it's '93 and I'm cruisin'
Met me a man that's down with revolution
A G of another type
Not just a nigga trying to get another stripe
And when he see the cops he put the stare on em
When every nigga that I know is just scared of 'em
He don't want to slap it, flip it, rub it
He just want to check it and protect it
And when the riots jumped off he showed power
Serving more cocktails than happy hour
He told me that the government never was a friend of me
But the real enemy
So now I do dirt of a different kind
Cause now Yo-Yo has got a different mind
Never did like a mark, cause marks just bore me
I'm coming with a Westside Story

[hook]

Throwing up the Westside G-Ride hoo ride!
Throwing up the Eastside G-Ride hoo ride!

Throwing up the Southside G-Ride hoo ride!
