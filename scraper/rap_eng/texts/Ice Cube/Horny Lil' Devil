[Intro]
You are the prince of darkness
Arch enemy, father of evil
Hell born, demonic, savage, fierce, vicious, wild
Tameless, barbaric, uncontrollabe, obstinate beast

[Verse 1]
Horny little devil, you gotta back up
Horny little devil, you can't bust a nut
Lookin' at my girlfriend's black skin
You wanna jump in, but she don't like white men
So don't flirt at work, you fuckin' jerk
Or get your punk devil ass hurt motherfucker
She ain't with the pale face
Cause y'all fuck at a snail's pace
And you might get sprayed with mace, from the ebony
So when she's doing her job you better let her be
Don't try to pinch the gluterus
Thinkin' that you about to knock out the uterus
Cause she'll tell you to kiss her ass quick
And where I'm from, devils get they ass kicked
Mr. Sexual Harrasment
Asking for a blow and when the answer is "fuck no"
Looks like you wanna terminate
But that's when I go Psycho like Norman Bates
I wanna kill the devil for talkin' shit
Cause he can't get a taste of the chocolate
African breasts; cause white bitches have no butt and no chest
Black women have bodies like goddesses
Sorta like Venus, but put away your penis
Cause the devil is a savage motherfucker
That's why I'm lighter than the average brother
Cause you raped our women, and we felt it
But it'll never happen again if I can help it (me neither)
Cause nobody in my neighborhood has caught jungle fever yet
So horny little devil, you better listen
Before yo' ass come up missin'
And it's like that

[Verse 2]
Now you wanna get me
Horny little devil must be, a F-A-G
Tryin to fuck me out my land and my manhood
Have me broke eatin' Spam, and canned goods
Locking down on my neighborhoods
Treat me less than a man cause right now you got the upper hand
But my ass is a virgin
You might have fucked the Indians
But you can't surgeon me
And when I'm on top I won't be fuckin ya
I'd rather put a buck in ya
Cause I hate the devil with a passion
And when I see the whites of his eyes I start blastin'
Dig a hole and throw his ass in
And I won't be happy till I'm down to my last ten
Get his fuckin' pitchfork
Tie him up, and then feed the bitch pork
Little devil can't fuck me out my pay
Cause horny little devil true niggas ain't gay
And you can't play with my Yo-Yo
And definitely can't play with me you fuckin' homo
Cause we'll blow your head off
And turn that white sheet, 'to a red cloth
Plus when they're all dead
I can cut that Jheri juice and get a bald head
Then let it nap up
Go down to the corner store and beat the Jap up
Clean all the crap up
Out my city, now the whole block look shitty
Put his dick on a wood block
Swing swing swing, and chop chop chop
Now who's the next to nut
Color Me Badd, but you can't sex me up
So don't even try it, put your dick on a diet
Cause this is Watts Riot 1991 and I'ma get my gun
Put an end to the devil, so get a fucking shovel

(repeat chorus)
