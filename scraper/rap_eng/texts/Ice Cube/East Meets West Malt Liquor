[Erick Sermon]
It's the E-R-I-C-K
Talking about the St. Ides brew
Run through a Can or two
Share with my crew this magnificent
Plus, it's mellow
I'm funded the rust of the commercial
And passed the Mic out to my fellow

[Parrish Smith]
No need for a Mic check
Bust it, the beats are set
Then grab a forty
Contumely y'all to snap his neck
St. Ides!!
Take a sip and wipe your lips
Keep my forties getting warm
I'm audi, gots to fill

[Ice Cube]
Drink it, drink it, drink it
Then I burp, after I slurt
Ice Cube, I put in much work
With the PMD and the E
Drunk it, as a St. Ides brew on the door

[Outro: Parrish Smith]
Yeah, EPMD and Ice Cube in the house
Scratching with him one of the funkiest rhymes... {*censored*}
Kick it, kick it, you gots to chill now
