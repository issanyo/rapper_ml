Consider this an invitation, to my gangsta nation

[Nate Dogg]

[Hook]
This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'll run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck

[W.C.]
Nigga I'm tired of this niggas barkin that shit talkin that shit
From the concrete when they chalkin' that shit
And then he goes in a bitch pose and a throw back
Holdin' a gat ain't gonna bust and know that
It's a Dub-S-C thang WC brain
And we don't FUCK with niggas in khaki g-strings
Fuck movin I'm clearin the crowd
It's the who bangin ban-dana cri-mi-ni-mi-nal, the ori-gi-nal

[Mack 10]
Evacuate the building bitch here come a plane
No, it's the mad ass Westside Connect Gang
And fuck what you playin nigga this who bang
With enough game to drive a swear bitch insane
And we number one gunners no we ain't stunners
It's real with us homey, killers and drug runners
And Mack need a D-bo in a H2 Hummer
Lookin hotter than a South Central L.A. summer, let's go

[Hook]
This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'd run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck

[Ice Cube]
What the fuck is Ice Cube talkin about
That's how you get these nuts parked in you mouth
Westside ride bitch, the same old shit
I don't conversate with pussy I ain't gon git
I don't holla at these hoes that sing like Ashante
Body like Beyonce, face like Andre (uhhh)
Bitch you kinda strangé
But I'm rich so my entré
Got to be bombay

[W.C.]
Have you seen us? Naw
Haters can't see us
Connect Gang we the G'est nigga
Countless calls and countless charges
Street niggas makin blunts out of Cuban cigars
Big by the linnas hyp-notic by the liters
With a flank of hoes on us cause the chronic is the greenest
And to my niggas incarcerated and on probation
I'mma stay bangin for the whole G Nation, nigga

[Hook]
This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'd run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck

[Mack 10]
It's a Gangsta Nation if you in you a G
And the whole world influence by the B and the C
Now tell the truth rappers you don't ball like me
Cause I'm really from the gang ya'll is industry
And while I'm servin up and comin young hustlas and cluckas
Bangin for the hood causin havoc and ruckus
You niggas at the label kissin ass like suckas
And you're bitches so sit down when you piss mutherfuckas

[Ice Cube]
One thing I do know I ain't the uno
Big puno rap sumo on pruno (you know)
I'd like to thank the congregation
And my affiliation to the Gangsta Nation
I'm hard on them, yeah I'm ruthless
You like a stick pussy, nigga you're useless
You know the side bitch, better get up on it
Cause it must be a single with Nate Dogg singin on it

[Mack 10]

Look here man
Check this shit out man look
Ya'll might as well say: fuck it and join this
Westside thing man
Cause we got a muthafucking Gangsta Nation goin over here
And once you join this shit you as G as can mother fucking be!
Believe that homie
Look it ain't a hit til Nate Dogg spit

[Nate Dogg + (Ice Cube)]
This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'd run'n'duck
We still right here don't fresh your luck
