[Intro]
Yo Cube, there go that motherfucker right there
No shit? Watch this
Hey, wassup man
Not too much man
You know you won, G
Won what?
The wet t-shirt contest, motherfucker!
*gunfire*

[Verse 1]
It's on like Donkey Kong
You wanted that fast buck
Now I gotta light that ass up
The nigga with the big fat trigger
Don't test me, gravedigger had the swig
Of the ST, remember the time we first met up?
You threw your set up now you gotta get wet up
BOOM! PING! BUCK! POW!
Now who's that nigga with the different style?
Uhh, ya wanted ta trip
It's all about the clip and who can empty it
First mate, they made day AK
And I'll Kurtis Blow ya ass away like AJ
I'm almost certain I'm put on the hurtin
Bitch, it's curtains!
Locced in my motherfuckin head
Gotta play connect-the-dots with my infrared
You in danger, Mr. Gangbanger
It ain't cool to take candy from a stranger
Wit'cha drive-by's it took time to catch ya
But now I gotta wet'cha

[Hook]
Now I gotta wet'cha (wet'cha)
Now I gotta wet'cha (wet'cha)
I'm comin ta get'cha (get'cha)
You better hope I don't catch ya (catch ya)
(You're all wet) The nigga with the big fat trigger
(You're all wet) The nigga with the big fat trigger

[Verse 2]
S-I-M-I Valley for the KKK rally
A place on the map where the order is
Those devils can beat up a motorist
And get nothin but a slap on the wrist
Gorillas, gorillas report to the mist
The fist of fury and I'ma shove em
Motherfuck the jury and who ever love em
Why you have to leave it to Beaver?
Now I'm chasin Beaver' ass with a cleaver
With the swing, swing, swing and chop, chop, chop
Get them up, nigga
Cos tonight we're havin chopped liver
And I'ma cut out'cha heart
Start the fryin pan for the devil a'la carte
Twelve motherfuckers ya better be glad I never met'cha
Cos I'm gonna wet'cha

[Hook]
Now I gotta wet'cha (wet'cha)
Now I gotta wet'cha (wet'cha)
I'm comin ta get'cha (get'cha)
You better hope I don't catch ya (catch ya)
(You're all wet) The nigga with the big fat trigger
(You're all wet) The nigga with the big fat trigger

[Verse 3]
Now wet motherfuckers are bloody
Cos a bullet'll mold your ass like silly putty
White in the shape
A hollow point'll run up in ya like ya got raped
Comin out'cha back, Mr. Mack
Now they got yo' guts in a sack
Used to have ya crew real fat in a huddle
Now you're wet in a puddle
Here is the Ice Cube rebuttal
You ain't gotta chance, cos even if my bullet just glance
Ya still wet your pants
So what'cha wanna do when I got'cha ass point blank
Ya guaranteed to spank
Stiff as a board, ya floored
Go meet the Lord and then get ignored
Cos you're on your way to hell and that I can bet'cha
That's why I had to wet'cha

[Hook]
Now I gotta wet'cha (wet'cha)
Now I gotta wet'cha (wet'cha)
I'm comin ta get'cha (get'cha)
You better hope I don't catch ya (catch ya)
(You're all wet) The nigga with the big fat trigger
(You're all wet) The nigga with the big fat trigger
(You're all wet) The nigga with the big fat trigger
(You're all wet) The nigga with the big fat trigger
The nigga with the big fat trigger
The nigga with the big fat trigger
The nigga with the big fat trigger
The nigga with the big fat trigger
