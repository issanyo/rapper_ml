(E-A-Ski)
You fuck around and get around from the pound
When I’m busting
Niggas talk crazy till they feel the repercussions
The fifth Skitho catch you in your street clothes
Niggas act streets but turn sheep when that heat rose
I keep the heat close, leave them underneath flow
Go ahead, gamble with your life nigga, heat rows
For pete sake, can you haters relay
Are you blinded by your envy that you couldn’t see straight nigga
Do you need some byvocals are you desperate for a track, are you willing to buy vocals
Or they willing to buy locally?
Is your music nationwide that you spittin' it bicoastal
You should ask yourself, most Ski get a chance, you should blast yourself
If I wanted your opinion I would ask your help
That’s why every single night I gotta ask myself

Lord please, don’t let me act a fool
Please, don’t let me use the tool
Please, don’t let me get distracted
Please, don’t let me make it happen
Please, oh god, keep my integrity
Please, don’t let me commit a felony
Please, forgive thy enemy
Please, forgive me cause you know I need therapy

(Ice Cube)

Please, don’t fuck with me
Every burst in the day Adam fucked with Eve
I mean worst than the day that they found them trees
With apples all on it, you niggas don’t own it
Fuck my opponent, it’s no competition
You’re fat off desert, I’m still in the kitchen
Suckers get murked with all that ambition
You small potatoes, nigga I’m the greatest
Genghis Khan with Chuck Taylor’s gang
The West Coast damn bitch I’m James Bond
Jump off the plane, no parachute on
Land on my feet, nigga trick or treat
Smell my cologne, shot to the dome
If I act like this you would tell me I’m wrong
Should I crack you like crack or just sing this song
Lord help these niggas understand I’m grown

Lord please, don’t let me act a fool
Please, don’t let me use the tool
Please, don’t let me get distracted
Please, don’t let me make it happen
Please, oh god, keep my integrity
Please, don’t let me commit a felony
Please, forgive thy enemy
Please, forgive me cause you know I need therapy

(E-A-Ski)

And you know I need counseling
So many haters now I stopped counting
I stopped checking the youtubes and comments
The bitch niggas making remarks to start conflicts
Conflicted in their life, cause they want a piece of scheme
And they wanna step in my light
If they try to make a move then they know the weapon is right
By my side when I ride I’m taking your breath of life
Huh, your spirit is now a kite
Every lyric is the wind no bringing you back to life
I could kill you with a pen the music is like a strike
Or blow but I know you never was that tight
And we never was that tight
I can sense she was a bitch
She’s something just wasn’t right
Got me in a place where I went to straight flip
So every single night I’m saying the same shit

Lord please, don’t let me act a fool
Please, don’t let me use the tool
Please, don’t let me get distracted
Please, don’t let me make it happen
Please, oh god, keep my integrity
Please, don’t let me commit a felony
Please, forgive thy enemy
Please, forgive me cause you know I need therapy

It’s like the mission ain’t complete
Till these niggas do the beat and Mr. Ski throw heat at ‘em
He don’t even matter
They throwing shots ya
But they just ricochet when niggas say does not matter
It’s not a dent nor a scratch not a tarnish nor a hole
A juggernaut, watch me folk
Under pressure while I flourish
I encourage niggas often try to off 'em who can stop them, not a soul
I show them what the game do, show them what I aim to
When in drought no doubt
Ski is who they came to
Begging me to save you, rain is what I gave you
Trying to doubt my cloud nigga when I made you
Fifth EA-Ski told ‘em nigga holla
