[Verse 1]
Attention all parents!
Report to your local therapist!
Report to your local church!
Report to your local Police department!
It's going down!
Glaring into my son's eyes reveals a pain
I felt her in the day
It was all about the pussy
If you can get it
A little girl like me never fucking liked it
We ain't taking no more!
We ain't taking no more, go!

[Chorus]
So save me!
I, I!
And the children are born!
You feel it through me!
I, I!
You're the children of the KoЯn!

[Verse 2]
Dropping smoke in the alley making noise with the double pump
Bring your boys to the party we can double up
Double rowdy, double 'bout it, hardcore teenager
Fucking bitches major!
Catch me if you can
Fuck the law with my dick in my hand we coming rough
Generation triple X we all about the weed smoke and the kinky sex
Nigga what?

[Chorus]
So save me!
I, I!
And the children are born!
You feel it through me!
I, I!
You’re the children of the KoЯn!

[Verse 3]
Called a fag my life!
Then I got it so fine!
It's so pretty like me!
Go figure, once a fag
Now a player!
Baptized and born!
I'm the children of the Korn!
Fuck authority!
Hit your ass in the head with my 40
You girls see more of m
After school, you better run to your car
Class clown already know I'm a star
The children of the Korn was born
From your porn ass twisted ass ways
Now you look amazed
I'm sitting in a daze in a purple haze
You better check my pulse
'Cause nothing seems to faze
Bitch!
Look and see I feel the parents hating me!
Why don't you step outside and feel me?
How you gonna tell me where to skate, who to date?
How to fuck, how to kiss, who to love, who to diss?
How to live, what it is, something got to give?
Parents or the kids, it won't be the kids!
It won't be the kids!
We're talking shit 'cause life is a bitch!
You know it is!
Everybody's trying to get rich, God damn!
All I wanna do is live!
All I wanna do is live!
All I wanna do is live!
