(Voice-Over)
Ice Cube, WC and Mack 10
The gangsta, the killa and the dope dealer

Got 'em', look nigga, you fit the description
This is dedicated to potential victims
Because crucifixion ain't no fiction
Too much bitching, get your ass beat into submission

[Hook: Ice Cube]
To all my white niggas, to all my light niggas
To all my dark niggas, I'm trying to spark niggas
I want to shark niggas, Not to mark niggas
Fuck the park niggas, I want your heart niggas

[WC]
The hood most honorable, carnage, geronimo prank nigga
Prosecuted for making your brain splat nigga
And Crocker sense is the westside nickel
Jim Brownin' you bitches off the back of a window, yeah

[Ice Cube]
From O.J. to MJ and Michael Tyson
They fucked up Saddam like my nigga gangsta mind
You don't have to be a Taliban to feel the baton
Throw up the W, victims of the red, black and blue

[Mack 10]
I kicks in the door, waving a automatic
I'm mad as fuck, breathing hard as a asthmatic
Attitudes unpredictable, behavior is sporatic
Could snap at any time, and right now I ain't had it, bitch

[Voice-Over]
Make no mistake about it, your life has just been threatened (echo)

[Hook: Ice Cube]
To all my white niggas, to all my light niggas
To all my dark niggas, I'm trying to spark niggas
I want to shark niggas, Not to mark niggas
Fuck the park niggas, I want your heart niggas

[WC]
I'm cockin' the hammer, fuckin up the camera was working on things
Like Kobe they trying to throw dirt on my name
Mo money, mo drama, but nigga fuck the hype, flash the light
I'm Dub-C connected to the afterlife, c'mon

[Ice Cube]
You look hard, act hard, in the backyard
Front yard, lunch card, but the nigga run hard
I run yards, punk guards, nigga so large
If I get caught, nigga no charge

[Mack 10]
Here come a westcoast gangsta in khakis and creases
Plus a pink slip nigga, you punks is leases
My white Bentley got peanut butter guts like Reese's
Blood peeled niggas is red like an endangered species, fucker

[Voice-Over]
In his age of terror, fear is the killer
One thing remains constant
The Westside motherfucking Connection

You might as well keep it gangsta
They've got us all under surveillance

Bitch you know the side
World motherfucking wide

[Hook: Ice Cube]
To all my white niggas, to all my light niggas
To all my dark niggas, I'm trying to spark niggas
I want to shark niggas, Not to mark niggas
Fuck the park niggas, I want your heart niggas

[Voice-Over]
Too many lost
Too many lost
