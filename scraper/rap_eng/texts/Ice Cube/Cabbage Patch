[Dr. Dre + Shakespeare + both]
Went to a party in West L.A
Wanna learn a new dance, that's what you say
Well, here's a new dance that can't be matched
So just step to the floor and do the Cabbage Patch

When I got to the party, it was half past 9
Cold rockin' to the rhythm a B-boy's rhyme
When I stepped to the floor it was a total wreck
'Cause I tried to do The Wop and almost broke my neck

Now when I got to the party, all the girls went nuts
'Cause I was jammin' to the DJ's cut (Say what?)
Word up, it was a trip, oh yes indeed
Hurt my back when I tried to bust the Centipede
Then I stepped off the floor just to keep my respect
Saw my homie Dr. Dre cold rubbin' his neck
He said, there's a new way that's right and exact
So we made this dance called the Cabbage Patch
Now it's easy to do, only done by a few
So just pay close attention to the Wreckin' Cru
You don't need fresh clothes or a pretty face
You just need hella beat with a so-so bass
Now my name is Dr. Dre, and I'm Shakespeare
And we're about to put the Cabbage Patch dance in gear
So if you wanna learn the dance, then you should not miss
'Cause it goes a little something like this...

[Break]

If you didn't see it, here's what you do
Just listen up close and we'll explain to you
'Cause the Cabbage Patch dance is only for fresh kids
But they have to know exactly what time it is
You move your left shoulder up and the right one down
And if you wanna get ill, try to turn it around
You have to move your feet too, that's what I said
But they have to syncopate with the moves of your head
When you got the dance right, then you will know
'Cause your body will sweat and your face will glow
And if you try another dance then you've got nerve
'Cause any other dance is to the curb (Yeah, it is)
It's the Cabbage Patch dance and it's from L.A
It started with Shakespeare and my main man Dre
And with Lonzo here we only need one more
That's my mellow Yella man 'cause he completes the four
It's the Wreckin' Cru y'all from the T-O-P
Gonna do it like this 'til we're B-I-G
Shakespeare and Dr. Dre gonna rock it like this
Giving good vibrations just like Sunkist
Donovan's in the place, he's the engineer
Gonna try to make the cut sound crystal clear
When he pumps the bass up, your eardrums swell
From the three kick drums out the SP-12
So right about now it's time to get into it
The Wreckin' Cru is gonna show you how to do it
So get on the floor and take a chance
And bust a fresh move called the Cabbage Patch dance

[Break]

While you're rockin' to the Big Beat drum
Let us take a minute out and tell you where we're from
It's the West Coast city that they call L.A
That's sunny California where the ballers play
If you're not from here, I'ma let you know
That we never ever have to worry 'bout no snow
So just hit Venice Beach and put your mind at ease
'Cause it's the middle of the winter and it's 80 degrees
Cruisin' down Crenshaw with your top pulled back
Cold rockin' to the beat of the Cabbage Patch
Got a compact disc that's top of the line
12-inch EB's and a fresh Alpine
With the fresh Air Jordans and a Fila shirt
Headed to your homie's house 'cause it's time to do work
So then I called him on the phone to tell him I was near him
Had to cut the sounds down so that I could hear him
The last song we did was called "The Fly"
Didn't quite hit, let me tell you why
When we cut the song it sounded great
Went to CBS, got stuck in red tape
Held us up, kicked us in the butt
So we said "Forget it, fire up Kru-Cut"
Picked up a group and we were on our way
Fresh homeboys called C.I.A
