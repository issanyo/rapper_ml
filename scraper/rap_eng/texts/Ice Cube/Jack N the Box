The West Coast Warlord
The Grand Wizard
Ice Cube
Motherfucking head so big they
Call him jack n the box

{1st verse}
I'm a superhero, like Lou Ferrigno
Made Bob De Niro, look like a zero
Shine the spotlight, this is my night
Get your camera's ready, let it rain confetti
I'm a champion, I do what can't be done
In the real league nerd not the fantasy one
Throw your hands up, you can cheer for your boy
When I hit the stage get a ear full of noise
When I bring the noise from here to Illinois
Motherfuckers love when I do what it does
I'm all-star, superstar entertainer
World-class, first ballot hall of famer
Some rappers claim that they got a heart full of anger
How when your lyrics were written by a stranger
Fool I'm the greatest, you just the latest
I'm loved by your grandmama, and your babies

{Chorus-A}
See my head is so big they call me jack n the box
You can't impress me, so fuck what you got
I say my head is so big they call me jack n the box
Don't talk about money cause I'm stacking a lot

{Chorus-B}
Shine that light on me, put that light on me
Cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D
Shine that light on me, put that light on me
Cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D

{2nd verse}
I was a born loser, I was a born sinner
Now I am a winner, in the convention center
I got to take a bow, cause I still wonder how
The system didn't get me when I was a juvenile (just think)
Just think if I had got locked up
No "Boyz N Tha Hood" thanks to America
No Eazy, N.W.A. no "Friday"
Don't let ya motherfucking talent go to waste
Don't catch a case cause these people got a place
To throw your life away and take you right out the waste
Throw your hands up, you got to man up
I had to show the world, what I was made of
What you say blood, I was a slave cuz
Now I'm VIP, up in Vegas
I'm up in Nike town, so how you like me now
See the whole industry had to bite my style

{Chorus-C}
See my head is so big they call me jack n the box
I knew we would win, so I'm bragging a lot
I say my head is so big they call me jack n the box
My shit is so dope, it's like crack in the pot

{Chorus-B}

{Bridge 2x}
Now mama don't be mad, I got to show my ass
And thank these motherfuckers for my past
I got to let them know I never brake like glass (never)
What you looking at is top notch world-class

{Chorus-A}
{Chorus-B}
