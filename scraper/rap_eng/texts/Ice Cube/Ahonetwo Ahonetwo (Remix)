Artist: Del the Funky Homosapien
Album: Dr. Bombay 12"
Song: Ahonetwo Ahonetwo (remix)

I'm chocolate like a bar, but my name is not Roseanne
My skin has a pigment, reminiscent of a tan
I plan to grow dreads, but first a nappy 'fro
The longer the hair, the easier to scare a foe
It grows from my head til it covers up my face
People look and stare when I walk into the place
I grace the stage, I hates the age of charletons
Now I feel the time has come for me to spar with'em
Startin' with a swift up kick and an uppercut (Ouch!)
Plus the funky beat that moves your torso and your upper butt
Then I manipulate the spectators like David Copperfield and I drop a real rhyme
For the times are a-changin'
I rearrange my style like a jigsaw
People jock the styles and the rhymes cause it is raw
Walkin' through the streets of Berkley where I lurk free
Brothers try to jerk me to the side and try to hurt me
But perky little devils only get to levels lower than
The grower of the cannibus plants and I dismantle the stance
That ya take, cause I ache the ear canals
Many try to flex my neck, but fear the child, so yep

[Hook]
"Ahonetwo, Ahonetwo, I like it
Ahonewo, Ahonetwo, funky human bein'"

[DEL Talking:]
Damn, fools be jockin' us, you know why they jockin' us? '
Cause we got the straight ultra sound, fool. (Mind music!)
We got the straight ultra sound, fool. We got the straight beat
Fool. (Ha Ha!) We are the dopest, fool
(That's why all the fools at school be jockin' us)
(Yo, check it, check it, check it) (Check this out)
What's up Phesto, you know we the dopest...the whole universe. "

The friendly, many, scopin' up horizons
Keepin' eyes on the mischievious who flys on
The tip like a pile of feces, I release these
Mad troops like Dr. Claw with the mad beats
Sequence that we brings to the world like a flood
I leap like a tigger and I land with a thud
Collasal, causin' earthquakes and the earth shakes constant
Kicks more ass than Charles Bronson
I pounce like a cat cause I think I'm all that
When it comes to the drums, when I see how y'all act
The H to the I, oh my, oh man, it slams
I never came candied like the yams
Sambo, stands low, never to my lattitude
Never was a nigga and I never had an attitude
Never actin' mad at you unless you try to front
On the D-E like you didn't know the day of the month
Once they get a whiff of the shit, you know it's funky
Please keep up your gall
Cause I'mma ball them fools who hunt me
Act like you do, or rather act like you know
