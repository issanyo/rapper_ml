[Intro: Ice Cube]
With the West-Coast Warlord
Understand me! (yeah)
What they made of?
Ice Cube A.K.A the West-Coast Warlord
The Grand Wizard! (what they made of?)
The Don Mega! (uh-huh)
Represent!

[Chorus: Ice Cube]
I hear 'em talkin'... everyday!
Look at me, look at me - - No!
Look at me, look at me

[Verse: Ice Cube]
Understand, you just a bad mothafucka
I'm the man, you's a sad mothafucka
Music stops, you still tryna find a spot?
I come through, bull in a china shop
Geronimo, riding on a buffalo
Hannibal, mixed with rhyme animal
I can't stand a hoe that don't recognize
The difference between maggots and superfly

[Chorus: Ice Cube]
I hear 'em talkin'... everyday - - No!
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me
I hear 'em talkin'... everyday!
Look at me - me - look at me - - No!
Look at me, look at me
I hear 'em talkin'... everyday!
Look at me, look at me - - No!
Look at me, look at me
