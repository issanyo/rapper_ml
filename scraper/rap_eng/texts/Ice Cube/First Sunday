First Sunday
You are a woman!
First Sunday
White Jesus?

Every time these two best friends try to make a buck
(Who would steal money from a church?)
First Sunday, First Sunday
(They will hop the bank)
But when their lives go from bad to worse
(What if somebody got a gun?)
(White Jesus?)
They ended up busted
(A felony record?)
But when their lives go from bad to worse
(You are a woman!)
(Watch out, argghhh)

Ice Cube
(Five thousand hours!)
It'll take more than Tracy Morgan
(A father, a father, a father...)
To answer their prayers
(I saw this on MySpace)
This January
(Five thousand hours!)
(White Jesus?)
(A father, a father, a father...)
Tracy Morgan doesn't pray
(Watch out, argghhh)
First Sunday
(Who would steal money from a church?)
Best friends try to make a buck
It'll take more than faith
Katt Williams, Katt Williams, Katt Williams
(We didn't come here to hurt nobody)
Tracy Morgan, Tracy Morgan, Tracy Morgan
(We're not robbing no church)
Ice Cube, Ice Cube, Ice Cube
(Five thousand hours!)
First Sunday
(White Jesus?)
(Five thousand hours!)
First Sunday
(We didn't come here to hurt nobody)
(I saw this on MySpace)
(Cheez-Whiz?)
But when their lives go from bad to worse
(I'm not infected, I got papers to prove it)
Every time these two best friends
(We're not robbing no church)

F-I-R-S-T S-U-N-D-A-Y

(We didn't come here to hurt nobody)
These two best friends try to make an ice cube
It'll take more than these two best friends to answer Katt Williams
(Money we can't even steal, somebody stole it)

[Police sirens]

[Screaming]

Fuck

Crime doesn't pray
(I saw this on MySpace)
Every time these two best friends
(White Jesus)
Try to make a buck
(Who would steal Cheez-Whiz from a church?)
Tracy Morgan fucked Katt Williams
Ice Cube fucked Tracy Morgan
Katt Williams fucked White Jesus
Busted!
(Are a woman!)
But when their lives go from bad to Ice Cube
