[Intro]

[Hook: Ice Cube] x2
Even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'
Them nigga know how I act in a low-low
Slow mo', nigga check out my promo
You mo'fo's can't fuck with my mojo

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
I am the wrong nigga, too fuckin grown nigga
To go for that nigga, I ain't 'cha ho nigga
I got, a hair trigger, I am the dome splitter
The deep-sea sniper, you got the wrong niggas
Retire like Jigga, here comes the Attila the Hun
Killin niggas for fun, these rappers is done
The bigger they come, the harder they fall
I burn like the sun, continue to ball
He's got nuts and plus the Don touch
And split the fine dutch, Starsky call Hutch
He's laid, with some sluts, up in some guts
Just back, in the cut, he thinks he's King Tut
Cain't fuck, this nigga up, cause just, the nigga luck
That niggas, really love him and tear the city up
Uhh, even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'
Them nigga know how I act in the low-low

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
In that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep living in these wicked times
Peep, niggas after me cause they see I'm stacking G's and heat
You can holler if you want to please
I ain't runnin' with no punk crew be
Enemies and my range is on
You're in the danger zone
My fuckin' game is strong, hotline
You suckas better find ya mind I got mine
From hustling and busting them rhymes
To my niggas up in Quentin
Down on Rikers Isle stay rile
But a nigga gotta use his styles
These niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
These niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I'm hard, Jehovah said I'm barred from the pearly gates
Fuck Him, I didn't wanna go to heaven anyway
But my momma got me on my knees with my hands gripped
Talkin' bout some "praise the Lord" shit
Hail Mary, fuck her, I never knew her
I'd probably screw her and dump her body in the sewer
Our father, my pops stuck up dope spots big, black, and mean
With the fifth by the Gabardine
What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin'
The lesson from the Smith & Wesson is depressin'
Niggas keep stressin', the same motherfuckin' question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake

[Hook] x4
