[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Fool, you know how we do it
Westside
Comin' from the Westside
Nothin' but the Westside

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the bomb-ass rap song
Hittin' all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin' six on the tee-ta-lee, you don't want to see a G
Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo'-hoppin', ass droppin', Coupe DeVille
My troupe can, illâ€”fool, I got skills
So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

[Refrain]
Comin' from the Westside
Comin' from the Westside
Westside, comin' from the Westside

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Chillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud
Double parked and I'm talkin' to Dub
About who got a plan, who got a plot
Who got got and who got shot
'Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin' out the window
Fool, I got them bomb-ass tapes
Da Lench Mob, "Planet of the Apes"
I'm down with Eiht and Watts Up
Kam and Solo, they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want "The Bomb," just like George Clinton
S-K-D is down to catch a body
Put on "Knee Deep", we'll turn out your party
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

[Refrain]
You know how we do it

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Jack be nimble, and Jack be quick
If you wanna jack me on a lick
'Cause I'm that fool from South Central
You'll think you stuck yourself with a number two pencil
That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass
With "Mo' Bounce to the Ounce" in the dash
Mash up, Van Ness, headed for the West
Everything is great, slow down for the dip
On 100 and 8th and keep mashin'
Don't drink and drive, to keep the fo' from crashin'
Stashin' a Glock and I thought you knew it
You know how we do it

[Refrain]
Comin' from the Westside, Westside
Nothin' but the Westside
It's hittin' on the Westside
Fool, you know how we do it
