Everybody wanna play, but everybody's not a playa
In my ear with that shit, excuse me and say a
The same old shit but you try to come new with it
Talkin' bout what my man gotta do with it
He got a Tec-9 and you don't wanna fool with it
He'll kill your whole crew with it
And if I pull your whole card you get crowbarred
That's a bumper, jack, so take your number back
Cause I ain't gonna call you, all you wanna do is a crack-her like polly-o, lolly-ass nigga
Wish you had a girl that was trickin'
Notice I say you wish, you took the boys where they was strippin'
Niggas swear they number 1 with a bullet
Hate to pull your coat-tail, but oh well
A woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do
Be a mackstress, don't let these motherfuckers mack you

(A woman gotta do what a woman gotta do)

See what they do is dress you up in all this crazy shit
Make other womens jealous, wishin' they could have it
Buy you diamonds, got you flyin' to all these places
Payin' your rent, even your money's spent
See—shit is good and after a while you start lovin' him
Goin' place to place, to Fresno to Colorado
See what you don't know is what's in your bag
He done crossed you, now you're washed-up and got a
Ki' of cocaine and not a ounce of gain
These niggas mackin' again, damn
It's down 8 to 2 and we're losin'
Wish he had more games out there choosin'
More—hell of a hell of a, stop believin' what they're tellin' ya
Now you're stuck and I cannot help ya
A woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do
Be a mackstress, don't let these motherfuckers mack you

[Hook]

Sittin' in the county, waitin' for your sentence
Hopin', prayin', and wishin' they won't lynch ya
Every hour on the hour, you've got a visitor
It's Detective Mitchell
All he wants is your cooperation
"Now tell us everything you told us down at the station
Who sent you out here and who's the big man?
And what we'll do is we'll just slap you on your hand."
Blam, off to another division
They wanna protect you while they hang your nigga
You knew the job was dirty when you took it, you fool
Got used as a mule, wish you had your mack tools
Still up to no good, don't know who to trust
Wish you coulda kept it hush-hush
A woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do
Be a mackstress, don't let these motherfuckers mack you
