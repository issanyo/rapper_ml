Blasten
Niggas drivin round with they tanks and they shotguns
The only way I'm quittin if you bitches get me killed
Blasten
Niggas drivin round with they tanks and they shotguns
Screams of the room it gives me chills as i pop one

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Left that boy bloody red
"Why'd you leave him layin there?"
Cause he ran, then he said
Take this bread and make the spread
Break it up, and nigga don't be scared
I was only there prepared
I began to see that he was fucking round with the feds
Locin round to get inside a real rider
And have him snitching and getting real shit up outta names
40 consolidated to 44
They said he singin like a bird everywhere he go
Case is over, more pain but no pay
And these the G's that been fuckin up the gangbang
We all got one, nigga not one
Nigga pop one, got a shotgun, nigga drop one
You see me? That's Snoopy Whodini
Makin niggas dissapear, then pop em back in black teenies
To me, I keen satan but keep that on the low
Load it up, and we already foe
And they already know

[Hook: Ice Cube]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Set the stage
Turn the page
Grab the gauge
Shoot it quick
This we ride
This we wild
Doggy on some other shit
Daddy won't
Think he can't
Yeah he will
Bet he won't
Rep the side
Nine to five
Pop a nigga
Let he know
Don't get caught
Keep it g
Keep that thing by my side
Serve a set
Who we shootin?
Why we won't?
Why we ridin?
Daddy talk?
Anyone?
You ain't know?
He ain't know
Better, better
Better, better
Say he seen it
Know they know
Said he won't
Can't keep up
Loc' he got a cold stroke
Meantime, me and my
We just gon' let it go
Ay, what you thinkin' for?
Ay, what you think he say?
Everybody in and out of L.A
We got niggas gettin' shizzot
And rats on the plizzot
And plus we got to deal with these crooked ass cizzops
Aw no, the screams of a mother cry
And blaze and flames in the scenes of a homocide

[Hook: Ice Cube]

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
My very first gat was a fucking deuce-deuce
In the hood late night like i had some juice
Graduated to a .38, now I'm hard
Practiced my aim up in the back yard
Had the flash on fools that scooped the heat
How I got my mothafuckin' name in the street
By now a nigga was straight bangin'
159th street is where i'm hangin'
380 in a stash spot, dash for the regal
Now rolling with the pistol was so illegal
But niggas was dying so, so fuck that
They in they league, got one and get your gat
Now it's 9's and AK's
And all kinds of shells where a dead body lays
But never take it as a threat
To [?] and dogg carryin' heat? Nigga you bet
