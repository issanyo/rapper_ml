"This right here is payback from way back, I don't play that
This right here is payback from way back, I don't play that
This right here is payback from way back, I don't play that
This right here is payback from way back, I don't play that

Recognize a real dime when you see mine
And don't try and be one, ya fuckin' peon
I been like Dion for eons
You ain't nothin but a biatch

Messed around and let me re-up
I come back through and tear the street up
Ice Cube, nigga, you better D up
And when I come by bitch, you better be up

Ass up, face in the pillow
I don't give a fizzle
Got ta do my bizzle
The only nizzle that will never ever fizzle
Original, you niggas know

Gotta get 'em up (who wants some)
You better get 'em up (come get some)
Gotta get 'em up (who wants some)
You better get 'em up (come get some)
Gotta get 'em up (who wants some)
You better get 'em up (come get some)
Gotta get 'em up (who wants some)
You better get 'em up

I got ta get wit cha
Hit you with these things that I'm holdin'
Who wanna squab with the frozen
Now who wanna battle with the chosen?
You niggas lotion
I'm no emotion
I'm shrapnel from the explosion
Hit you in the face while you posin'
High as Jimi Hendrix
I lined up ten dicks
And took out appendix
So go get forensics
Let em know I'm geronimo
Till it's my time to go

You better find your ho
Get your babies and your mama
And move to Guantonimo

Doubt my skills
I'm payin my bills
I'm up in the hills
You niggas are kills
Even though I'm on a fucked up label
You bitches know what I can bring to the table

Gotta get 'em up (who wants some)
You better get 'em up (come get some)
Gotta get 'em up (who wants some)
You better get 'em up (come get some)
Gotta get 'em up (who wants some)
You better get 'em up (come get some)
Gotta get 'em up (who wants some)
You better get 'em up

This right here is payback from way back, I don't play that
This right here is payback from way back, I don't play that
This right here is payback from way back, I don't play that
This right here is payback from way back, I don't play that

I like bitches like you
Find two wearin light blue
The freak get high too
With a fly do
Not a Erika Bado
Thats lookin for eye do
Now what can i buy you
Just to try you
Need another bitch to lie to
Need another bitch in my coupe
Oh please can I trouble you
For a double scoop

A nigga needs some T 'n A
Now you can dick but you can't get no DNA
I heard you was a big freak
Bitch look down I got some big feet
I like Mike and Ikes
I like watchin dikes
I like goin to fights
I like earnin' my stripes
In the book of life
Theres only two women
Big ol good ones and good ol big ones

Gotta get 'em up (who wants some)
You better get 'em up (come get some)
Gotta get 'em up (who wants some)
You better get 'em up (come get some)
Gotta get 'em up (who wants some)
You better get 'em up (come get some)
Gotta get 'em up (who wants some)
You better get 'em up
