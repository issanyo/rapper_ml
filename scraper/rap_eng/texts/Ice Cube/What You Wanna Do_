Are you ready?

[Intro: Ice Cube]
South Central, Los Skanless
So what you wanna do?
Kausion
So what you wanna do?
So what you wanna do?

[Verse 1: Cel]
I'm all on the front line, down to put in work
I thumped once or twice but ain't never did no dirt
But I’m amped to put my flats on the MAC
With exchange of a scrap for a mothafuckin' strap
But I got to make a vow once I get the MAC-10
Now once I spot a rival, it's a must I do him in
I spin around the corner, finna get busy
I ask the big homie, "Who is he?
The fool with the wrong color on, standin' by the Brougham"
Said: "Your mission is complete
Once he get his head blown off his mothafuckin' neck"
Now the chin check 'cause I done wrecked
But they ain't even thought about the pen yet
You could smell the smoke in my clothes
The dope got me buzzed, askin' where we was
Is the fuzz, I'm pourin' out these suds
For them dead motherfuckers
Now they tryin' to stick 25 to a nigga
One more felony added to the two
Instead of killin' fools I wish I woulda bust at you
I'm only 13 but already servin' heat on these streets
Deletin' mothafuckas from the front seat

[Hook: Vocalist + Ice Cube and Cel]
With the rhythm it takes to dance
To what we have to live through
So what you wanna do?
What should I do?
Should I bang with the red or should I bang with the blue?
With the rhythm it takes to dance
To what we have to live through
So what you wanna do?
What should I do?
Should I hang with the fake or should I hang with the true?

[Verse 2: Kaydo]
I dumped 16 times, niggas don't want none
Infrared gauge aimed for your lungs
Lil' devils don't go to Heaven, won't come to Heaven
'Cause I'ma cock back and leave seven
Layin' in your chest, where was the vest
Mr. LAPD? Y'all can't check me
Fade the rest, I'ma roll with the Crips
And try to get ghost when the one-times trip
It's 24, ain't a joke, homies get your L's
Just closed Lakeside, now I'm in a cell
Eased up, light a sack—nigga, fuck that!
I'd rather ride 100 Spokes, bent off 'gnac
You call it what you want
'Cause I don't keep my Glock on safety
Gonna smoke yo' ass if you make me

[Hook: Vocalist + Ice Cube and Kaydo]
With the rhythm it takes to dance
To what we have to live through
So what you wanna do?
What should I do?
Should I bang with the r-izz-ed, or bang with bl-izz-ue?
With the rhythm it takes to dance
To what we have to live through
So what you wanna do?
What should I do?
Should I hang with the fake or should I hang with the true?

[Verse 3: Gonzoe]
I'm thinkin' fuck school, Mom's bangin' at the do'
Lettin' me know my black ass best hit the flo'
Here we go again, teachers wonderin' where I been
With no absence slip when I bails in
Smellin' like the stickiest shit on the streets
Got stress joints for a buck fifty each
Service slow, five poppin' up the bungalows
Me and Cel mack flow, Crippin' on all the hoes
Leave 'em froze from the game I spit
Hollerin' you's a virgin, but I'm knowin', bitch, you love dick
So what's up, trick? When Gonzoe rock that spot
You on my jock, my video's on the Box

[Hook: Vocalist + Ice Cube and Gonzoe]
With the rhythm it takes to dance
To what we have to live through
So what you wanna do?
What should I do? Should I bang with the red
Or should I bang with the bl-izz-ue?
With the rhythm it takes to dance
To what we have to live through
So what you wanna do?
Homie, what should I do?
Should I hang with the fake or should I hang with the true?
With the rhythm it takes to dance
To what we have to live through
So what you wanna do?
With the rhythm it takes to dance
To what we have to live through
So what you wanna do?
With the rhythm it takes to dance
To what we have to live through
So what you wanna do?
Grab the .22 and show these fools that you true
