Intro
[Ricky Harris]:
Here we go on station 103.787 and we're listening to… uh
We won't be listening to, uh. Ice Cube, *Amerikkka’s Most Wanted* Because that’s bullshit, get that shit out of here
Straight R&B, straight R&B, straight R&B

Verse 1 [Timm Elliott]:
Yo
Say
Moving into caves but I'm vague
But I'm deep like a secret door
Then grab the Sorcerer's Stone and turn mist
Like I'm Voldemort
Statue when I hold the four, hold the fort
Mask made of chloroform
"Wu" symbol like a nigga called a swarm
Just to inform and in-shape optical
Optimist proteges watching the building shake
Treat the dragon like a garter snake
Rapunzel rope played the escape
Hardened red armor for the rocket-mate
Say he wears the mask just for Heaven's sake
Just like Thanksgiving dinner
Got to let it cultivate
Float because I know the fate
Know the prophecies in my head
Watch them rotate, eye too
Takes you to find you
Lost in a time loop
Hope that this message finds you
Said I'm Fonzie
Hit the autopilot just to find z's
Like I'm playing Zelda
Said, your eye's in the sky
Said I'm here for the Terra
I'm here for whatever
The White Coat, it glows in the mirror
I will never forfeit
Said I'm Ora, like the Forbes' List
Deep in these forbidden forests
In a four door
Looking for the fountain of youth
Become one, like the center of the sun
Talk energy, I'm too static
The Black Adam
Coyote faces that we could have had, um
RedFacee

Hook 1 [Esé Michael the Mighty Maverick] (Tevin Carter):
(hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ice in my Henny now
Ice in my Henny now
Ice and I'm dumb faded
Ice in my Henny now
Dumb faded, dumb faded
Ice in my Henny now
Look

Verse 2 [Esé Michael the Mighty Maverick]
My slight revenge wasn't planned for one treacherous hit
I'll bless you all with holy crap
These niggas steez-less and pissed
I pray a hater never comes through with a seize and desist
'Cause I'll be damn if I compromise
I'm pleading the fifth
With no more reason that this:
I just want to get my rocks off
So I'm kicking flows that's icy
And y'all coming through with rock salt
Changed it, morphed it, based it on what I think the top's on
When I finally make I feel jaded
'Cause the top's gone
When y'all gon realize that there's no sense in flexing
Rapping bout your ice and threads
Over free beats, you finessed it
Baby mother put my daughter on FaceTime when text me
When are going to see you next?
When can we stop with the stressing?
Chuckle, timid, y'all ain't serious
I'm be back with the stacks
But now I'm faded and she's fading out
Played out over laugh tracks

Interlude
[sample]:
I don't know, you know what I'm saying
Me and my boo thang were going through some things
At one point in time
And, like, I don't know
I wrote this song
I think I was sipping on something
And that shit just poured out

Hook 2 [Esé Michael the Mighty Maverick]:
Ice in my Henny now
Ice in my Henny now
Ice in my Henny now
Dumb faded, dumb faded
Ice in my Henny now
Dumb faded, dumb faded
Ice in my Henny now, look
Please bring me ice in my Henny now
Ice in my Henny now
Ice in my Henny now
Dumb faded, dumb faded
Ice in my Henny now
Dumb faded, dumb faded
Ice in my Henny now, look

Verse 3 [Esé Michael the Mighty Maverick]
I think I’d like to be a better man that what I am
Instead I’m leaving by avoidance
Annoyed by my lowness
This void has no condolence, for a moment
I thought at least I'd have the shadow of a showman
I’m caving under open-ended convo's with no notice
Anxiety is high in me, I know my surface shows it
I’m taking on these loads
And I must say the weight’s a-tolling
I’m hoping for atonement
All I’m giving is a phone-in
A half ass job, no Basquiat
I’m stroking out a phony
A work, a load of hurt
Sso maybe give me that
I may not be complacent, God, please keep my faith in that
I may not just keep racing, God, please keep my faith in that
My faith a laugh
I lead the race in laps
Screaming take me back
To a time when it’s simple
To a time where I’m young
Back when the currency was kisses in the native tongue
Back when heroes weren’t so common so I made them up, damn

Hook 3 [Esé Michael the Mighty Maverick]:
Nights aren't an ending now
Nights aren't an ending when life is off of feeling now
Impulse buys of ice that looses shimmer now
Ten dark guys polite
But still ain't getting now
We're paying the tabs
Please bring me ice in my Henny now
8-1-6 you nice in Kansas City now
Broadway bridge to south side
My committee now
Black Wallstreet, I'm aldermen of the city now

Verse 4 [Esé Michael the Mighty Maverick]:
What’s the point of building wealth when it’s just for myself
I know my better but my daughter thinks I’m someone else
My baby mother knows my character too fucking well
She knows my phoning in responses like they’re fucking spells
See I’m a poet whose well versed in being Janus-faced
See I’ve been known to be verbose but that’s the illest trade
Cause as I blow and smite my foes
They rarely feel the spade
My words are toasts to novice tones, I’m unashamed
I know my pride has made a monster of me lately
Mixed with vices and long nights
Now in your eyes I’m more than shady
Money’s sent to your account
But I still ain’t seen my baby
I’m indebted to these sessions
'Cause I know this music made me
My faith in man has truly weakened
I can’t trust a word y’all saying
Younger days when kids looked different
And my niggas lied in spades
Back when Grandma slid me money every first when she got paid
Now she say “I love you baby”
I can’t look her in my face
On my face sits the selfishness and the pain
All the times that the jump off screaming out my name
All the times that my BM asked me about a ring
My decisions far from Christian got my mama praying
And got this ice in my Henny, damn
