[Intro]
Freedom is a road seldom traveled by...

A to the K to the 4 to the 7
Little devils don't got to heaven [Lench Mob]
(Went to the shelf and dusted off the AK)

[Verse 1: J-Dee]
An AK talks, but bullshit runs
I wish I had time, to count all my guns
Cause a nigga is runnin' out of funds
But H. Rap says "Freedom got a strap!"
[I wish I was in dixie, AK, AK
Then shit wouldn't have been bad in the sixties
No way No way]
I, can't see the OG's standin' in big lines
Holdin' big signs, tryin' to get mine
[I'll shoot ya ass 17 times]
Cause this week we don't turn the other cheek
Do that shit and get stole on
Non-violence gotta roll on, plus we got a hold on
The mayor of the whole fuckin city
Saw the Lench Mob and his drawers got shitty
So get the fuck out my way when I say
Hey - freedom got an AK

[Hook]
A to the K to the 4 to the 7
Little devils don't got to heaven [ repeat ]
(Freedom is a road seldom traveled by the multitude . . . )

[Verse 2: J-Dee]
Used to be a buck masta, buck mast-er
Or sit back and get fucked faster
Than a horny-assed rabbit, [dagnabbit, cause I gotta have it]
[Shoot 'em up Shoot 'em up, ah yeah
Talkin' like that'll have 'em all scared]
Don't come to me wit no petition
[Fool come to me wit ammunition!]
Cause the bang-bang, buck-buck, boom-boom, pow-pow
Used to be a trick [but bitch - how ya like me know]
Cause the Ak-40 dick hold a 50 clip
And I'll shoot till it's empty bitch
That's how you got filthy rich
I know the game, so I'mma do the same
Don't like when I play the same way
And say - hey - freedom's got an AK

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J-Dee]
You better call nine one one
The nigga's got a gun, and he's gonna have fun
An Ak-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a mutherfuckin' fool
Cause I'll have to run around and point
And fuck around and have to shoot the whole fuckin joint
A is for apple, K is for killin
I'm killin - 47 million civilians
So if you wanna jump your ass in, come on -
I'm buckin and blastin'
The L to the E to the N to the C to the H to the M to the O to the B
And you'll see
One dead devil - kick that shit to the level
Here's my shovel, cause I don't play
Motherfucker - Freedom got an AK!!!!

[Outro]
A to the K to the 4 to the 7
Little devils don't got to heaven
A to the K to the 4 to the 7 [Kick That!]

Went to the shelf and dusted off the AK [x4]
