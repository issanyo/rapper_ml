They call me Hollywood (Here come the big show)
They call me Hollywood (Here come the big show)

Watch me hit the corner on these muthafuckas

[Hook]
They call me Hollywood (Here come the big show)
They call me Hollywood (Here come the big show)
Let a bitch know!

[Verse]
See my nigga Snoop is always up in the coupe
And my homeboy Dub you know I'm fuckin' with cuzz
See my nigga Game you know
He's running with bloods
Boy you know the name Ice Cube
Show me love
My homie $hort
Catch him at the airport
That Crazy Toones always high as the moon
That nigga June he is the brother of Bone
And he got a gun that's the color chrome
See my nigga Tony Draper always chasing the paper
And he always keeping gangsta
Bitches catching the vapors
See my homie Starr
You might not know who he are
He in the club with his locs on up in the dark
Boy that nigga Keeb
Get whatever you need
See we call him Bo
Nigga check his M.O
These are the people I know
These are the places I go
This is my world muthafucka
Just one big show

[Hook]

What you see muthafucka
V.I.P muthafucka
What you see muthafucka
This is my cousin BR
He's just like my right arm
He might fuck you with charm
But don't be alarmed
This is my nigga Big Hurk
He's just like an expert
In the business of hurt
See my nigga do work
That's my son Doughboy
And if you get him annoyed
He might drop 'yo ass off
And pull out his Droid
Oh My Goodness
OMG is his brother
Cause of his ass
I got to move from daughters to mothers
Like Jinx always up in the pink
Smell his finger and I bet that muthafucka will stink
See my homie Deion ain't fuckin' with no peon
And that nigga Kobe you know he's going for 40

[Bridge 2x]
These are the people I know
These are the places I go
This is my world muthafucka
Just one big show

[Hook]

Do I know Denzel?
Yeah I know Samuel L
I got love for Mike epps
That nigga funny as hell
Did I talk to Dr.Dre?
Have I seen MC Ren?
Every now and then please don't ask me again
Me and Greenfield been down since '80
I miss rolling in Mercedes with my homie K-Dee
I put money on the books for my nigga J-Dee
See Shorty is a Muslim use to be crazy
I ate dinner with Martin
And had meetings with Magic
Chopped it up with 2Pac
Before it was a tragic

[Bridge]

They call me Hollywood
Red carpet
V.I.P. bitch
They call me Hollywood
Complimentary everything

[Hook]
