[Intro: Don Jagwarr]
Now dis one dedicated to de man dem call MacGyver (bo!)
And all double-oh-seven James Bond spy man is from de area (gunshot, gunshot)
Maximum respect to de man dem call Ice Cube (bo! bo!)
Him nah bust no deuce-deuce, no trey-eight, but four-four (GET WICKED!)

[Verse 1]
One, two, three and I come with the wicked
Style, and you know that I'm from, the wicked
Crew, act like you knew
Cause I got everybody jumpin' to the voodoo, kick it
Wicked rhymes, picket signs
While me and the Mob gotta trunk fulla nines
Play ya and I'll slay ya
I got the mayor by the hair
Ready to BUCK BUCK BUCK and it's a must
To DUCK DUCK DUCK before I bust
Lookin for the one that did it
But like En Vogue, no you're never gonna get it
Cos I'm the one with the fat mad skills
And I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills
Sittin' at the pad just chillin'
Cause Larry Parker just got two million, oh what a feelin'
So shake that nigga and pass me the pill
And I'll slam dunk ya like Shaquille O'Neal
Like it, dig it, maybe
And watch that test tube baby, kick it
Cause I get wicked

[Hook: Don Jagwarr]
You know dem wicked, Ice Cube and Torture Chamber sound
Yes dem wicked, him pick up de mic and buss up de ground
Yes dem wicked, all of dem gyal with de sound
My name is Don Jagwarr and Ice Cube we run de town (wicked!)

("Look at the way I kick it, I'm wicked")
Bo! Wicked! Bo! Wicked man! (Bo!)
("Look at the way I kick it, I'm wicked")
Bo! ("Wicked!")! Bo! ("Wicked man!") (bo!)

[Verse 2]
Don't say nuttin, just listen
Got me a plan to break Tyson outta prison
Come my way and get served
Still got a deuce that'll bunny hop the curb
Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin, never seen with a happy grin
Show the fat frown cause I'm down, take a look around
All you see is big black boots steppin
Use my steel toe as a weapon
Kick ya and flip ya, now they want to
Label this nigga' tape with the sticker
Diggin' out girls that's "nicety"
Plus I gotta body count like Ice-T.
From here to New York, I get skins and ain't talkin bout pork
Swine, pig, dig, listen to the flow of a so-called neg-
-ro, who didn't know I was funky as Wilson Pickett
Dig it cause I get wicked

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
People wanna know how come
I got a gat and I'm lookin out the window like Malcolm
Ready to bring that noise
Kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys
April 29th brought power to the people
And we might just see a sequel
Cause police got equal hate
A chazzer's a pig that don't fly straight
Through with Daryl Gates but is Willie Williams
Down with the pilgrims?
Just a super slave
We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave
I'm wicked enough to board this
Cause now it's on to the fullest
Gorilla straight from the mist
But I don't miss when it comes to uh this
Bring the yellow tape
The white cape, cause I'm so straight
Through with the picket signs, take this job and stick it, Bigot, cause I get wicked

[Hook/Outro: Don Jagwarr]
Yes dem wicked, dem wicked, jus pick up de mic
Yes dem wicked, dem wicked, jus put down de gun
Yes dem wicked, dem wicked, cuz we run de town
Dem wicked, dem wicked, cuz we run de town
Yes dem wicked, gwaan!

Back wha, seen, den de one dem call Ice Cube
International superstar don gorgon style (bo!)
Way back in Brooklyn, inside of Los Angeles, South Central style
Torture chambers, (bo!) dem run the country (maximum respect!)
And my name is Don Jagwarr, we are the top celebrity seen

Because we wicked, we wicked, we pick up de mics
Yes we wicked, we wicked, we put down de guns
Yes dem wicked, dem wicked, but we run de town
(wicked man!)
