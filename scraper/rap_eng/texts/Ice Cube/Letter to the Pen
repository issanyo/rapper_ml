[Intro]
(“Ain’t nuthin’ but a ‘G’ thang, baby”)
Yeah, this how we doing it this time
(“Ain’t nuthin’ but a ‘G’ thang, baby”)
Huh, peep this shit out

[Verse 1]
What’s up, baby? I hope this letter brightens your day
And put a big smile on your sexy ass face
You’re doing the right thing that a solider like you can do
Now stand tall through it all and pimp this shit
Just waiting on the day that you can come home
To see your baby—damn, it’s driving me crazy
I’ll be down next week to put some money on your books
And hey, look, don’t forget to take the celly up out that box
Sent you everything you need and got them new Jordans
Everything there is to shoot, you know my nigga’s sportin’
Sent you flicks of the baby, sent some shots in my bikini
Huh, I hope you’re glad to see me
Keeping a low profile although I’m nervous as hell
You know a bitch gotta love you sneaking shit up in jail
It’s cool, I got your back, you my nig’ and we all that
I wouldn’t be down if I can’t keep my nigga’s pockets fat
And it’s like that, ‘cause every week, I send a letter to the pen

[Sampled Hook]
(“Ain’t nuthin’ but a ‘G’ thang, baby”)
(“My life’s filled with rainy days”)
(“Ain’t nuthin’ but a ‘G’ thang, baby”)
(“Now my life’s filled with rainy days”)

[Interlude: Martin Lawrence]
Yo, man, don’t believe that old writing shit, man
Right now, man, she in a kitchen butt naked, man
Walking around making another muh’fucka a sandwich
With cheese on her titties, Now and Laters all in her ass
All that shit

[Verse 2]
I put a sale sign on your ‘fo and the nigga next do’ wanna know
How much you selling your rims fo’?
I told him it’s two for the tires, eight for the rims
Let me talk to my nigga to see what we can work in
All these nig’s want a deal, ain’t none of ‘em real
Like I don’t know what to quote, they wanna tell me what to sell it for
You know I ran into Pookie and Ben
I said, “What’s up? Y’all act like y’all can’t send my nigga no ends”
I told you niggas won’t be down when your ass ain’t around
They don’t even call, supposed to be your fuckin’ road dogs
But it’s like that, and every week, I send my letter to the pen

[Sampled Hook]
(“Ain’t nuthin’ but a ‘G’ thang, baby”)
(“My life’s filled with rainy days”)
(“Ain’t nuthin’ but a ‘G’ thang, baby”)
(“Now my life’s filled with rainy days”)

[Interlude: Martin Lawrence]
I’m telling you, man, I knew the girl before, uh
Before I even came in the muh’fuckin’ joint
Before you met her, man
I’m telling you, the girl like a muh’fucka to pull her hair
I’m talking about the hair on her back, man
I’m telling you, man…

[Verse 3]
Before I bring it to a close, baby, you stay sweet
And don’t forget that I’ll be down for my visit next week
My big sister Trish said “hi”
Tony and Shay dropped by to say that Dee got five
You know they caught him with two ki’s flying back from D.C
The Feds ain’t no joke, hanging niggas from ropes
You better know, huh, yeah
‘Cause every week, I send my letter to the pen

[Sampled Hook]
(“Ain’t nuthin’ but a ‘G’ thang, baby”)
(“My life’s filled with rainy days”)
(“Ain’t nuthin’ but a ‘G’ thang, baby”)
(“Now my life’s filled with rainy days”)
(“Ain’t nuthin’ but a ‘G’ thang, baby”)
(“My life’s filled with rainy days”)
(“Ain’t nuthin’ but a ‘G’ thang, baby”)
(“Now my life’s filled with rainy days”)

[Outro: Martin Lawrence]
Yo, man, you keep ranting and raving about this muh’fuckin’ girl
Like she all that
Nigga, I’ma tell you like this
Right now, muh’fucka, she letting another nigga wear your clothes
All out to the club, right now, nigga at a club in an argyle sweater
Some muh’fuckin’ Pierre Cardin shoes, and Sassoon jeans
The muh’fucka’s a bammer, nigga
And wearing your shit ‘cause you was a bammer
Now get the fuck out my face!
