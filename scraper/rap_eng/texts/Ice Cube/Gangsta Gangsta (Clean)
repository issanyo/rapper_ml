[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Here's a little something about a brotha like me
Never shoulda been let out the penitentiary
Ice Cube would like to say
That I'm a crazy motha from around the way
Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out
Now I'm the type of punk that you read about
Doin' a crime or two, that's what the hell I do
You don't like how I'm livin well [garbled]!
This is a crew, and I'm in it
My man Dre'll knock you out in a minute
With a right left, right left you're toothless
And then you say -- damn they ruthless!
We'll make you say it again [damn]
N.W.A's messing up the program
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no, we're too busy saying: "Yeah"
About drinking straight out the eight bottle
Tell the truth -- do I look like a role model?
To a kid looking up to me
Life ain't nothin but girls and money
Cause I'm the type of brotha that's built to last
We had some in the present, some in the past
But I don't give a damn cause I keep bailing
Yo, tell em what they yelling

[Hook]
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they're yelling
(It's not about a salary, it's all about reality)
Gangsta, Gangsta
(He'll tell you exactly how he feel, and don't want a thing back)

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Homies all standing around, just hanging
Some dope-dealing, some gang-banging
We decide to roll and we deep
See a sucka on Daytons and we creep
Real slow, and before you know
I had my AK pointed in the window
Check it in, punk, or I might blast
He got scared and hit the gas
We tried to catch him, but you all know
You can't catch a five point oh, so
We headed right back to the fort
Sweatin’ all the girls in the biker shorts
We didn't get no play, from the ladies
With six thugs in a car are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showing
We all said [garbled] and kept going
To the hood, and we was fin to
Look for somethin’ else to get into
Like a new female, or in fact
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
On a sucka for nothin’ at all
Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball
I might stumble, but still won't lose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
Cause I'm the type of brotha that's built to last
We had some in the present, some in the past
But I don't give a damn cause I keep bailin'
Yo, tell em what they yellin'

[Interlude: Dr. Dre (MC Ren)]
Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this
(Man whatcha gonna do now?)
"What we're gonna do right here is go way back"
How far you goin back? "Way back"
"As we go a lil somethin like this"

[Ice Cube]
Here's a lil gangsta, short in size
A t-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
Built like a tank yet hard to hit
Ice Cube and Eazy E [Dre:] cold rockin' it

[Verse 3: Eazy E (MC Ren)]
Well I'm Eazy E the one they're talkin about
Sucka tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
Police tried to roll, so it's time to go
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
With the "Diamond in the back, sun-roof top"
Diggin' the scene with the gangsta lean
Cause I'm the E, I don't slang or bang
I just knock suckas out like it ain't no thang
And all the ladies, you know I'm talkin to you
"We love you Eazy!" Yeah, I love you too
Because you see, you know I gotta be legit
(So let me tell you stupid suckas who you're messing with]
Cause I'm the type of brotha that's built to last
We had some in the present, some in the past
But I don't give a damn cause I keep bailin'
Yo, tell em what they yellin'

[Hook]
Gangsta, Gangsta, that's what they're yelling
(It's not about a salary, it's all about reality)
Gangsta, Gangsta
(He'll...up you and yours, and anything that gets in his way)

Gangsta, Gangsta, that's what they're yelling
(It's not about a salary, it's all about reality)
Gangsta, Gangsta
(He'll just call you a low-life mother..., and talk about your funky ways)
