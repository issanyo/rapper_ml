[Ice Cube-Repeat 2x]
We live in la la, We smokin la la
Fuck wit the da, Boo boo ba ba
Nigga, Ha ha!

[Hook]
Get outta pocket, We might just whup yo ass
Pull out a rocket, We might just take yo cash
And when I cock it, We might step out and blast
But we ain't gon let that bullshit pass

[Ice Cube]
I used to be a young phenom, Like lebron
Now I'm doin shit beyond, Geghis Kahn
Peon, You can't pass on deon
The best rapper in the world ain't a european

[Mack 10]
Look, Respect my gangsta, Nigga obey
And I been rich since my first pro day, Ask O'Shea
West ridin is my fotay
And will the hustle ever stop? Nigga, No way

[W.C.]
Niggas can't fuck wit dub s c
Gang related and leavin 'em leakin like stds
C-Walkin out of the sc, Lettin the tech breathe
Till I rest in peace, Dub gon rep these streets

[K Mac]
K Mac is the one, Nigga fuck neo
No love, Hit 'em up with the dub wherever we go
My game so cold, The hoes call me sub zero
Oh, You know that nigga pimpin ken? That's my hero

[Hook] - 2X

[Ice Cube]
It's catastrophic when I stop it
Atomic, Demonic, And off that chronic
It's Ironic, How I flip them phonics
So fucked up, The product of reaganomics

[Mack 10]
Shit, I heard the price of yo done went up
My gun buddy had a drop, So the pistola went up
The heater hot, Nigga burn ya skin up
The fo fifth hold a dime, And I shoot all ten up

[W.C.]
I'm about guns, Fuck roses, I breeze over parole
Some man captured some folks, The locstas never fold
Bacon soda aromas, Niggas swingin chrome motors
Dickey bombin folks and shootin out of stolen automotives

[K Mac]
I got diamonds on my fingers and watch on arms
Stay out a nigga way and you won't be harmed
If I catch a bitch, I'll see for sure she'll be charmed
When I'm rollin through the hood, A nigga heavily armed

[Hook] - 2X

[Ice Cube]
Shit, My life is like a rap show
I'm out the back door, Beyatch, So beware of the strap, Bro
Cause that's how my blast go
Ice cube is an asshole just like castro

[Mack 10]
Nigga, I spit Flames, Leave permanent scars
Connect gang bang and we g's about ours
And ain't shit changed, Still stripes and stars
And I'm done already, Ain't got but 4 bars

[W.C.]
Holdin it down down down stoned down bustin rounds
Dub, Ghetto rich nigga since bow down
Squad down, Sendin flicks to my niggas locked down
Doin dolas in streets wit my ragtop down

[K Mac]
Yo, Write a book bout a nigga like me
I got loot like an athlete just signed wit nike
You lose ya life if ya ever get sheisty
Could mac ever run out of snaps? Not likely

[Hook] - 2X
