[Intro: Dr. Dre Scratching and Cutting quote below]
I know you gonna dig this....

[Verse One: Ice Cube]
Fly girls and booze each and every night
Crowd rocking rhymes, boy, that's alright
Treated like a star as you can see
But just rhyming for the cash money
Keep the crowd rocking for about B.G
New best believe that's C-O-D
Suckers like you don't make no dents
Cause it's all about making those Dollars and sense
Girls on my jock, when I'm up the stage
Reports trying to cluck, put me on the front page
C.I.A. in back of me, and cash money is our specialty
Boys In The Hood keep trying to dig
All girl friends think their heads is big
Promoters at the show trying to run that bull'
But odds got pull, get paid in full
Gold easy record cause you know it's mine
Clean my skeezer with the FU sign
Rapping all the time on the US Mint
Love spending green Dead Presidents
TV elect, just want respect
Show me a cheque, I'll break your neck
Hardcore, L.A. not like the past
I rap just for the cash.. MONEY!!

[Break: Dr. Dre + all Chanting "cash Money"]
I like money, man
Cash money, man
Keep it all with me
And I like that money with me
Cash money, man..

I know you gonna dig this....

[Ice Cube]
Homeboy rocked the Mic like no one else
K-Dee introduce yourself, get busy boy

[Verse Two: K-Dee]
K-Dee in the house, Dre rocks the beats, Jinx still ill for my Posse
Ice Cube writes the rhymes to close the show
Me breaking freaks, making dough
I was the King of teasers there on attack
You turned the wax, up to the max
Girls in the place, to get me laid
Rhyme Zones the ace, make sure I'm paid
C.I.A. not with the dumps
Get more attention from the Me Me Amp
West L.A. is where I'm from, not a bum I didn't cum
Get some green by the Levi blues
Don’t wear sneakers, they’re tennis shoes
Punks around the way think I most ill
Cause I love to chill with that dollar bill
Where I go I make that dough
Door stop at reporter, get toss pesos
Ill, L.A. not like the past
I rap just for the cash.. MONEY!!

[Break: Dr. Dre + all Chanting "cash Money"]
I like money, man
Cash money, man
Keep it all easy in my fist
And I like that money with me
Cash money, man..

I know you gonna dig this....

[Interlude]
[Ice Cube] Posse 3
[Sir Jinx] Cold rocking the microphone
[Ice Cube] Posse 3
[Sir Jinx] Awwww yeah, I hold my own
[Ice Cube] Posse 3
[Sir Jinx] Check it out, cause here I go
[Ice Cube] Posse 3
[Sir Jinx] Cold making that dough
[Ice Cube] YOU KNOW!!

[Verse Three: Sir Jinx]
Hip-Hop rhymes for the cash money
Sometimes a DJ, sometimes an Emcee
Turned to the cut, but that's alright
Getting paid everyday, getting laid at night
More money made, the more money spent
Making more money than the US Mint
Kick up the bass if you hip to get paying
Aim to get rich, if you know what I'm saying
Calling me a punk, you ain't making a cent
Reaching in your pocket, boy, you're snatching up lint
A.O.A got the beat going, cuts and rhymes keep the cash flowing
Dre is the producer, give the knowledge to him
Bass pumping so HARD leave the place condemned
If Barley was rapping, you knew, he'll get ripped
Cause I'm holding down L.A. like a vice grip
It's money, honey, that's no mistake
Keep Filas on my feet, big mack on play
Gold on my fist, my pocket's getting fat
"Why?" - it's like that, it's in my contract
Hip to play if you're hipped to pay
Jinx's spelling with.. a capital J
Death in L.A. not like the past
I rap just for the cash.. MONEY!!

[Break: Dr. Dre + all Chanting "cash Money"]
I like money, man
Cash money, man
Keep it all easy in my fist
And I like that money with me
Cash money, man..

I know you gonna dig this....

(*Crowd Went Nuts*)

[Outro]
[Ice Cube] That was def, yeah, yeah, that was def
[Sir Jinx] Yo, can we can paid in this mothafucker..
[Dr. Dre] Rewind it, rewind it, let me hear it
[Sir Jinx] Awww, is it still going?!
[Dr. Dre] That's cool, that's cool
