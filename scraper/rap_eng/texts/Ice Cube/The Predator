"There's no stoppin what can't be stopped
No killin what can't be killed.."

"There's somethin out there waitin for us." (repeat 2X)

[Ice Cube]
You can run but you can't hide
From the Westside night stalker, shit talker
Run and tell them it's the L.M
Nigga with the gat and I'm back
Off the everyday prey that I slay
Rollin with a fo' chase ya through South Central
Monkey-wrench ho should know that, she'll get the bozack
Cause I'm not stavin, but fuck that Johnny Carson ho
Never had me on the Late Night Show
Comin with the shit that'll hit
+Steady Mobbin'+ cause the flavor's good
There goes the neighborhood
Nigga with the third album; how come he don't fall off?
Rollin with the sawed-off gauge
Turn the page of the chapter, caught up in the rapture
But you know Anita, she can get the peter
Eat 'em up yum, and you're floored
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor - here comes the Predator

"Yo I'm out, but - I'll be back" (repeat 4X)

[Ice Cube]
Check your head for the new style
Fuck Laurence Powell and Briseno - Wind and Koon, pretty soon
We'll fuck them like they fucked us and won't kiss 'em
Riots ain't nothin but diets for the system
Fightin with the beast, no justice, no peace
If any, even if we fuck up Denny
Niggas are sick of your white man tricks with no treat
That's right; now it's on, on sight
You call me a Muslim, no I'm not a resident
Still got my vote in - Farrakhan for president
Of white America, I'm tearing ya a new asshole
Who's the nigga with the new black
Strollin to your suburb house and I douse
With gas, now who's cleanin up trash?
Eat 'em up yum, and you're floored
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor - here comes the Predator

"Yo I'm out, but - I'll be back" (repeat 3X)
"Yo I'm out.."
"Here comes the Predator"

"There's somethin out there waitin for us."

[Ice Cube]
Got my black rag showin and I'm hoin; Ira Reiner
Can kiss my grits like Flo, on "Mel's Diner"
I'm meaner than a motherfuckin hyena chasin antelope
Put my chrome to your dome, watch it bust like a cantaloupe
I can't stand a rope, so don't try to hang 'em
Talk about dogs; boy I can slang 'em
Rat-a-tat-tat on your noggin
Cause Ice'll cream your ass like HÃ¤agen-Dazs
Chocolate - I get - crazy when I catch wreck
Even be flippin the tongue like da-diggity-dung Das-EFX
So who is Ice Cube? I'm a rapper, actor, macker
Got a little problem with the redneck cracker, did the tallywacker
Jerry Heller is a devil shit-packer
Comin with a crazy pitch
And the Statue of Liberty ain't nothin but a lazy bitch
Don't wanna give up the crack, to the black
But you'll call it racial, if we go and rape the ho
But eat 'em up yum, and you're floored
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor - I am the Predator

"Yo I'm out, but - I'll be back" (repeat 3X)
"Yo I'm out.."
"Yo I'm out, but - I'll be back" (repeat 3X)
"Yo I'm out.."

"They indicated, that when trapped, the creature activated
A self-destruct device, that destroyed, enough rainforest
To cover three hundred city blocks." {*KA-BOOM*}
