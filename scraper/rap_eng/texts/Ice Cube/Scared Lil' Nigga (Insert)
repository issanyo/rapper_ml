[Ice Cube]
Scared little nigga, scared (SCARED!!)
Scared that the devil won't let you shovel
Like a slave, your own fucking grave
Scared little nigga, scared (SCARED!!)
Scared to think, scared to drink Kool-Aid
Made by your poor black mama, scared of the drama
Scared little niggas
Scared that the powers that be, will see 'D'
Black as me, you scared little nigga, Scared (SCARED!!)
Scared, don't want to be associated, easily intimidated
Hated when we were segregated from whitey, the all mighty
Scared little niggas hollering Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
But mad to find out that he is us
Scared little niggas, scared (SCARED!!)
Scared, what you're gonna do; on that dayyy!
When the USA; ain't ran by the old Fayyy
Scared little nigga
