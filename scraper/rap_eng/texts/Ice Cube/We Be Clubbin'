What you think gon' happen if I get Ice Cube
To do a joint with the wildest dog on the east coast? Man
They don't know. Heavy weight Def Jam
Clark world

[Verse 1: Ice Cube, (DMX)]
Once again, it's on the motherfucking psycho
Ice Cube the don mega, with my nigga DMX
Huh, a diamond in the rough
Punk, he gon' stay in the rough
East meets west, it's going down
Yeah, we be clubbing
We be clubbing
We be clubbing, we be clubbing, we be clubbing
I'm in the city bitch, we clubbing (nigga, what)
I'm treated like the presidential motorcade
Taking out the residential global persperation
Freaky gyrations close to fornication
Numbers get passed when asked information
Intoxication faded inebriated
Designated driver liver than Macgyver
Blocking freaks in all of 'em tens
Stallions get them to pile in
Sitting on 'lacs bitch we write raps
Backdo' access you getting jealous
Standing all in line with designer umbrellas
Bad fellas running with the East Side connection
Any kind of club with a star check they weapons
Who wanna sex DMX get naked
Fucking to security show us the exit

[Hook: Ice Cube, (DMX)]
Heavy hitters counting figures
We be clubbing
Mixing blunts and heavy liquors
We be clubbing
For all my live ass niggas
We be clubbing
Fucking all them gold diggers
We be clubbing
(we be clubbing, we be clubbing, we be clubbing)

[Verse 2: DMX]
DMX, Ruff Ryders
Grrr, grrr
All I do is import to export transport to west port
A nigga still breathing today cause the vest
Caught them slugs you sprayed at me now
Get at me if you want more
Put a fucking hole up in yo' back
So what's the front for?
Come on baby we some noisemakers
Catching niggas with bricks at am I ? ?
Coming through Las Vegas
Made us wanted dead or alive
On mad niggas hit lists
But ain't a motherfucker come & get this
Witness what's unheard of cold blooded murder
This hot shit'll have you smelling like a fucking burger
And the shell from the twelve is all it takes
To make a nigga spin like twice & then fall
You call for help
But ain't none coming
The avmen slaughtered the robbery & gun running
And when I'm done gunning we all gon' meet up at the club
Fucking with Cube it's nothing but love
Nigga, what!!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ice Cube, (DMX)
New York get ya club on
L.S. get ya club on
Chicago get ya club on
Atlanta get ya club on
Fuck that shit
If the dog's off the leash then the dog's gonna bite (rooof)
If the dog's in the ring then the dog's gonna fight (rooof)
If the dog's on the west coast then I'm fucking with Cube
Where them hoes at nigga keep 'em coming in twos
Like noah I make it wetter the doubleheader
Hit that ass like I got a vendetta you know it's better
With the don mega shake it off shake it off
Take it off take it off and make it soft, biotch
Uhh, it's all good it's all right
Fuck all day fuck all night
Call all my niggas cause wherever I go
Y'all my niggas east to the west coast all my niggas
Now the east to the west
Piece of the best sick of this shit (grrrrr)
Added DMX to add grit in this shit (grrrr)
Atlantic to pacific spitting this shit (grrrr)
Got love for my niggas that's getting a grip (grrr)
We be clubbing

[Hook]
