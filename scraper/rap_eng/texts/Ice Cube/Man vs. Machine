[Intro]
Yo, we in a fight for our lives
We in a fight for our lives
And the trip thing about it
I don't know if we can win
And what's sad.. I don't think we wanna win

[Verse 1]
Can you help me? A nigga need a job
I'm desperate, for some corn on the cob
I'm helpless, will I have to steal and rob?
No black business so I got to ask Bob
Bob got a job but it's done by a robot
No lunch break so it can do a whole lot
Mo' than a human being, and it's European
Ran by a Korean-American
So there I am, surrounded by aluminum
It's nowhere you can run
It's nowhere you can be
It's just you and me, versus modern day machinery

[Hook: repeat 2X]
It's man vs. machine, baby
My head's in the guillotine, baby
It might take it off clean, baby
Automated dreams equals man vs. machine, baby

[Verse 2]
I'm a fly caught in a web
A fish stuck in the Internet
Don't they know I'm a deadly catch?
Eat this meat, every bite so full of stress
So what can I say to you?
I'm highly relatable and bio-degradable
I thought we was unfadeable
Slaves to machinery, is that the way to go?
I don't need you to fuck
24-7, I gets that computer love
I don't need you to love
Human contact, ain't what it used to was

[Hook]
It's man vs. machine, baby
My head's in the guillotine, baby
And it took it off clean, baby
Automated dreams equals man vs. machine, baby

[Outro: Repeat 2X]
The whole world is automated
It need to be investigated
When people are eliminated
What we 'posed to do when it's time to feed all the babies?
