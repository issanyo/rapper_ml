Heh, yeah..

{They won't call me a nigga..} - 2X

Listen to the preacher man, but are you talkin to me?
I can't hear you with a mouth full of pig's feet
Thy shouldn't eat the swine flesh
Your body is a mess, but you're blessed
With the father, son, spirit and the holy ghost
But my whole neigborhood is comatose
Lookin for survival
The devil made you a slave and he gave you a bible
400 years of gettin our ass kicked
By so-called Christians and Catholics
But I'mma watch 'em burn in the fire
See I'm a G, that's why I ain't in your choir
Cause I see, cause I know
The church ain't nuttin but a fashion show
Get the devil do a one-eighty-seven
And they won't, call me a nigga, when I get to heaven

{They won't call me a nigga}
{when I get to heaven}
{No they won't! Haha no they won't, no they won't}

You're waitin for the devil to come from the ground
Clown, take a look around
Just look at the cross that the priest is holdin
A beast, in sheep's clothing
But I'm rollin, with that knowledge of self
Cause heaven, ain't just wealth
So mister preacher, if I couldn't pay my tithe
Do I have to wait outside?
White man, please take another look
Cause we couldn't be readin out the same book
Cause you'se a crook and I'm a brother
King James had sex with his mother
Is that yo' edition? Is that your religion?
Black man, you gotta make a desicion
Cause God is comin on day number seven
And they won't, call me a nigga, when I get to heaven

{They won't call me a nigga}
{when I get to heaven}
{No they won't! Haha no they won't, no they won't}
{They won't call me a nigga}
{when I get to heaven}
{No they won't! Haha no they won't, no they won't}

The same white man that threw me in the slammer
He bombed the church in Alabama
So if I cock the hammer, God won't mind
If I have to kill the human swine
Cause God is a killer from the start
Why you think, Noah had to build his Ark?
And God is a man from his feet to his hair
That's why you say 'amen' after each and every prayer
I just stare at the church man
Spendin mo' money on the church band
But Elijah's got a plan
Got the white man screamin - Damn that Farrakhan!
Cause one day these babies'll uprise
Much more than bow ties and bean pies
Kickin knowledge at the 7-11
And they won't, call me a nigga, when I get to heaven

{They won't call me a nigga}
{when I get to heaven}
{No they won't! Haha no they won't, no they won't}
