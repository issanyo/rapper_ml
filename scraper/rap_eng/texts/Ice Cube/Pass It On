[Chorus]
Take a hit and hold your breath, pass the tweed to the left
Take a hit and hold your breath (“Then light another joint”)
Take a hit and hold your breath, pass the tweed to the left
Take a hit and hold your breath (“Then light another joint”)

[Verse 1: Yo-Yo]
Excuse me for the interruptions, don’t mean to rush ya
But you’re holding up the bud
You done had it in your hands for the longest
Now doggone it, you better put a rush on it
Me and my friends all blended in to get these two tens
‘Cause you didn’t have no ends
Now I ain’t frontin’, homie, but homie, this ain’t stress
This that crunchy bomb bud that put a lump in yo’ chest
Now, I know you think that I be smoking do-do
But everybody knows that my crew smokes indo
Don’t be offended when I say you had it too long
Take a hit and pass it on

[Verse 2: Sukii]
Chillin’ on the couch, damn, I’m just gigglin’
Mouth dry, glassy eye, you know my ass is high
Sukii is on hit, so gimme that shit
And let me take the blunt and place it in between my lips
Acting like a schitzo, blame it on the indo
Calling up the man ‘cause I’m a bud nympho
Blaze it kinda slowly, you would see what no see
I’m putttin’ on a cloud, it’s time to pass the blunt, G

[Verse 3: Lady T?]
Smoking on the blunt like a muthafuckin’ hoodsta
The chronic’s got me doing shit I never thought I woulda
Now we kickin’ it at the house and we ‘bout 16 deep
My eyes so muthafuckin’ tight, it’s looking like I’m half-sleep
And “Dead Homiez” straight bumpin’ in the background
As I reminisce on my niggas from the underground
And when I’m off that, Chocolate Thai, I feels real high
But if you slip or trip, I’m quick to bank you to the eye
So kick it if you’re kickin’ it and join a bomb smokeout
This is LAPDK, all day, so fuck what you talkin’ ‘bout
And I’m out (“Then light another joint”)

[Verse 4: Nick Nack]
Nick Nack is in the house, medicine’s in the house, big bud smoking
And you know it’s the bomb if I start choking
Joint after joint, I want my high to be noticed
Rolling with the IBW’s and we’re true
Packed with a fat sack of that crazy light green
(Hit it kinda hard) And the results is quite mean
Puffin’ nothing less than the indo, and for your info
Been pulling on one since the intro

[Verse 5: Big Chan]
Hit the bud, homie, and pass it to the left
I’m getting my flow on with chronic on my breath
I guess I’m in the right place at the right time
Hitting the hooter, so fuck the ‘No Smoking’ sign
I can barely stand after blowing the dub sack
I’m high as a kite when in flight and I love that
Hell of a sensation, my expression is shown
Tweakin’ from the tweed, time to pass it on

[Verse 6: Shorty]
I’m loaded, pulling on the hits and then I hold it
Feeling the effects of the chronic while we’re rollin’
Wish I had some tweezers for the joint, I might could pass it
Spitting up saliva, it’s so potent that I’m gaggin’
Now I’m gonna pass, but the G, she don’t sweat her
I look and now my head’ll hit the joint and say “forget her”
Shorty, chick from the east, Chitown from fatal A
Just lick and stickin’ the papers the old…

[Verse 7: Dawn?]
Got the chronic in the place, two fifths in the trunk
Posse deep, niggas hype, ready to get fucked up
Three cars following, freaks just packed in
Chillin’ at the lakefront, ready to get drunk
Homie from the posse telling me to pop the trunk
So we could smoke dank and hit the drank and get fucked up

[Verse 8: Yo-Yo]
It’s the Yo and I’m buzzin’
It’s the chronic that I’m lovin’
Smoking on the indo, rolling up the fuckin’ windows
Make ya hate it, I’m so faded but steady blazing it
I can’t think without my muthafuckin’ drank
It’s a shame, fiendin’ for the Mary Jane
Looking for a nigga on the corner that slangs
Somebody make a stop at the Jamaican spot
‘Cause I could smoke a whole lot
I give a fuck if you only hit it once
Make a habit to pass it, I bought the muthafuckin’ bag, bitch

[Chorus]
Take a hit and hold your breath, pass the tweed to the left
Take a hit and hold your breath (“Then light another joint”)
Take a hit and hold your breath, pass the tweed to the left
Take a hit and hold your breath (“Then light another joint”)
Take a hit and hold your breath, pass the tweed to the left
Take a hit and hold your breath (“Then light another joint”)
Take a hit and hold your breath, pass the tweed to the left
Take a hit and hold your breath (“Then light another joint”)
