My pockets stay fat, and they always like that
Not only in pocket but in my bank
There's stacks and stacks of dough
Some get mad cause they can't understand
That I'm 23 years old, I'm in command
I'm down with DITC, that's "Diggin' in the Crates"
I'm staying fat, cause what comes around goes around
Brothers always shout
"Good lookin' out Show" Yeah, without a doubt
But don't try and take advantage
I'll just leave you alone instead of putting that ass in bandages
Signing off is Show B-I-Z
And next up is A.G., he likes his pockets F-A-T

"I like my pockets fat not flat"
"I like my pockets fat not flat
"I like my pockets fat not flat
"I like my pockets fat not flat

Check it out yo, A.G. is living fat
In the mental, in other words?
And I'm a top-notch competitor
Carrying dough like a treasurer
Getting pussy, oh that's regular
But the sex I never take
And you know that's a fact, black
So if she says no, that means no, and that's that
No matter how cute or how desperate
()
Yeah, she gotta see the exit
But I'm not mad I didn't hit it
I just dial seven digits and some skins that's with it
You gotta be smart and keep a down low in the projects
Watch your step and take it easy
Or act like Stevie Wonder because you know you can't see me
Don't sniff no coke, but I might drink a brew
Or maybe two (Andre the Giant, not you)
Yeah, wrecking MCs with just my demo
And pulling all the cuties with no problemo
Step back, get your sticks and your bats
Know you step up because my pockets are fat

"I like my pockets fat not flat
"I like my pockets fat not flat
"I like my pockets fat not flat
"I like my pockets fat not flat

I'm not trying to be a bum with a 40
That's not my style, I gotta work hard like Naughty
By Nature, you should understand
To get yours in this land, you gotta work for yours, black man
You think it's easy because I rap?
So don't ask me for a dollar motherfucker, you ain't handicapped
And if you was, you'd still have the chance
Look how I flip "ain't this a bitch" now I'm making you dance
Yeah it's Show B-I-Z from your neighbor H-double-O-D, I R-A-P
Cause I wanna stay fat
To keep clothes on my back and you know I never slack
For all the bums that said I forgot where I came from
Eating crumbs on the corner in the slums
I'm hungry enough to grow fangs
Here's a dollar, go to the store
But give me back my fucking change
I'm trying to make a million dollars, some shit I never saw before
So save that bullshit for later
So when I'm large, hoes give me head on an escalator
Yeah, I like to flow, I'm Show B-I-Z
A.K.A. Mr. F-A-T
