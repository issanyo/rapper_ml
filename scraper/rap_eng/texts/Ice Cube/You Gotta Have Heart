[Intro]

[Chorus]
What don't hurt ya
Will only make you stronger
In this game you gotta have heart
This hustle will break you down
Pull you apart

[Mack 10]
Homie, the same thing make you laugh, make you cry
And in the fast-lane the strong survive and the weak die
That's the way the ball bounce and I often wonder why
But I nease it all
And not just a piece o' the pie
I used to hope and wish for everything I couldn't buy
I was a young ghetto-boy that grew up in the eye
So I bowed to be a hustler and reach for the sky
And not only am I ballin'
Right now is mo' ta'

[Ice Cube]
It's like a jungle sometime
U gotta hustle sometime
U gotta use your mind, mouth and your muscle sometime
U gotta grind
Stop looking for a saviour
Use what the fuck God gave ya (flavour)
I'm in the gutter-lane
Whit the gutter-mouth tryin' to get out the gutter
For my life's gutter-out
If I was White and called my mamma a bitch
It wouldn't have took me this long to get this rich (I know)

[Chorus x2]

[WC]
I was raised
The young nigga was scwabble
In the city o' looks
No hope or role-models
The black sheep o' the family destine to feel
Predicted to spend my hole life in a jail-cell
Fucked up and not believe in the hype
I know I would be more then a felon
I zoomed up and see the light
Nigga, got my mind right
Nigga, got my grind tight
Now a nigga is gettin' paid to skip
Skip to the lime-light

[Mack 10]
See, we all got problems
But some need addressin'
And so at night I hit my knees and thank him for my blessings
And ask him for forgiveness to minimize my stress
Nigga, continue to know how to dodge this Smith & Wesson
And with his help I will perform in my best
And it's still hard with all this temptation and testin'
An' if I'm wrong
Just accept it as a lesson
As I conquer all my enemies
And mashing with aggression, Lord

[Chorus x2]

[Ice Cube]
Ain't never been shot like 50 Cent or 2Pac
Cuz' 2 shots is too many
Too hot to go in me
I've rather sit remmy
In the back of this Bentley
And only fuck with niggas and you bitches that's friendly
Don't forgive what's so femmé
Fuck with my penné
I pull out the semmé
Put ho's up in Timmy
Just fuck it - it's Babylon
And nigga might have a bomb
Just like the Taliban
But I'm on never lan

[WC]
I sit alone in my fo' corner room
Loadin' ammo
Cuz' in these streets life there's a gamble
Like Run-D.M.C., times is getting harder
So I'm taking of my gold-fandelellin' to the author
Old nigga say to young killers awaked you
But when you got it
Only few homies stay true
This game it's like Russian roulette
We hustle to death
Mash for weather
Make the devil marker for cheddar

[Chorus x2]

[Ice Cube] [Hook]
Yo!
Won't you just stop fuckin' wit' us?
You know what I'm saying
You take what you got
I take what I got
Just stop fuckin' wit' us!
You mother-fuckers got everything and your still complaining
U mother-fuckers got everything and you still ain't happy
It's your world Mother-fucker!
And you ain't ever get it right
BIATCH!!!
