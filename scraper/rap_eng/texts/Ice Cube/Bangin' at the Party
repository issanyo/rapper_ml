[Intro: Mack 10]
Yeah, uh-huh..
Yeah this what we gon do: We gon fall through the hood
Scoop up the lil' homies, and hit the motherfuckin party, bang - out
Dig what I'm saying? we gon let them niggas get they walk on
We gon get our ride on, and leave with a couple of bitches
And rep this Dub S thang to the fullest westside..like that

[Hook: Skoop]
When the music is bumpin, and the homies give it somethin'
All the hoes is comin' and you KNOW they all fuckin'
Got the henny in glass, big puffin' on somethin
And the niggas outside, and these bitches wanna fight
Then them niggas pulled up, and they deuces all wired
And you know we banged out, when the homies come around
One times always turning it up..
Cause we bangin' at the party!

[Verse 1: Ice Cube, WC, Mack 10]
(Ice Cube) We come through on that 22 shoe
In that SL500 chappell hill light blue..
In cal-aye, we hit the Vallet
You ain't got it like that, park in the all-ey, nigga
(WC) Get in line while we, spit the line for ya
Get inside where we, gettin' high
(Ice Cube) On the danceflo' with a, big behind
Nigga don't get mad cause your dick ain't mind
(Together) So when you see the westside up in V.I.P
Don't bring your ass up there and try to be Ali
(Mack 10) I'll beat your ass back down, just to be on TV
(Together) We know bad publicity'll sell another cd
(Dub C) Fuck with that (Ice Cube: fuck with this..)
And I fuck with the crys'
(Ice Cube: Only fuck with the dough)..Never fuck with you marks
(Mack 10) and if your just getting in, motherfucker you 'tarded
Cause we Bangin at the Party!

[Hook: Skoop]
When the music is bumpin, and the homies give it somethin'

And the niggas outside, and these bitches wanna fight
Then them niggas pulled up, and they deuces all wired
And you know we banged out, when the homies come around
One times always turning it up..
Cause we bangin' at the party!

[Verse 2: Young Soprano, K-Mac]
(Young Soprano) Yeah, you know it's a white tee occasion
We in G formation, reppin' a G nation

Hop out with the sag low, strapped with the mag fo'
(K-Mac) It's cashflow, thick money rolls and thick hoes
(Young Soprano) We got those, and it's a party on the block loc!
....and it's a party on the block dawg..
(K-Mac) You know it's packed full of hogs, that's active and hard on hoes
Handcuffin your broad, is a negative

(Young Soprano) Believe, Skoop never nervous to crack a ho
Plus I got them sets on deck, servin like McEnroe

Why treat a bitch like a bitch, and let a ho be a ho
