[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I ain’t had to kill nobody
I ain’t had to kill nobody
Today was a good day
I ain’t had to kill nobody
I ain’t had to kill nobody
I ain’t had to kill nobody

[Verse 1: Tyga]
T-Raw killa, that nigga caterpillar
One hitter, only hit bad bitches that’s thriller
King Hakim, YM, Last King
Nigga sending out shouts, I’mma need a Jordan ring
Fuck you mean bitch this is really mean, Gotti after life
Future looking bright, bitches crack tongue on the pipe
I don’t wanna see you twerk, we about that fuck life
Got a Asian ho, pussy go deep, Jerry Rice
I’m a dope nigga, give a D, dope dealer
Don’t play with the grave digger, that’s RZA
Ask my bitch, she tell you ain’t no nigga
Like the one I got, dick game gorilla
Bag in my bag like a Philly nigga clip
Came extended grip, armor’s with the Ruger, easy ruthless
Nigga with a attitude, my enemies is 2 shits
Don’t give 2 shits but you gon make a nigga pull it, but shit

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Today was a good day
I ain’t had to kill nobody
I ain’t had to kill nobody
Shoot you in yo memory bank, memorize it

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Today was a good day
Cause I ain’t had to kill nobody
No I ain’t had to kill nobody
But I shoot you in yo memory bank, memorize it

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Duct tape, duct tape
Cover his mouth with duct tape
Check a nigga like a motherfuckin update
Where the safe nigga point to it
I catch a case, I wanna know who threw it
And my name, bitches speak fluent
I keep the feds busy
I got the bread, never fed pigeons
Even though I get pissed off I shit on y'all
We gon sip champagne out your skull
I can’t stand these niggas, I’m bout to fall
Got my girl her shoes with the spikes, volleyball
Fuck with Holygrove, it’s gon be a holocaust
Hoes see me shinin, now they actin like a moth
YMCM bizzy, why I'm always busy
I done got too big headed for the crown to fit me
But I got my niggas with me and we got our skateboards
TTYL, Thank Thank You Lord, amen, cause uh

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Today was a good day
I ain’t had to kill nobody
I ain’t had to kill nobody
Shoot you in yo memory bank, memorize it

[Bridge 2: Lil Wayne]
Shoot you in yo memory bank, memorize it
Shoot you in yo memory bank, memorize it
But uh, today was a good day
I ain't had to kill nobody, uhh

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
My dawg hit me yesterday, got 15 keys
And he gon let em all go for 15 G’s
She said she want a Birkin, I look up like bitch please
And I show that ho a brick like you ain’t tryna flip these
Yeah I’m back nigga, sellin' all these bricks
And if my homies sell you one you better not tell nobody shit
I tell them I’m back nigga, rockin all these jewels
And I be ridin through my hood like I ain’t got nothing to lose, shit
You thinking because I rap I won’t go buy them bricks
Give em to my dawg and let him do all kind of shit
Like take a point out, then put a point in
I fuck yo main ho and all my homies joined in, shit!
I’m getting money, must be the Illuminati
They think I signed up cuz I just bought a new Ferrari
But they said they want my mind, soul and my body
And I looked at that nigga crazy and then I shot him (BAH)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Today was a good day
I ain’t had to kill nobody
I ain’t had to kill nobody
Shoot you in yo memory bank, memorize it

[Bridge 2: Lil Wayne]
Shoot you in yo memory bank, memorize it
Shoot you in yo memory bank, memorize it
But uh, today was a good day
I ain't had to kill nobody, uhh

[Outro]
