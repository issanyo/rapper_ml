[Ice Cube]
Y'all punk-ass ninjas can't wait to see the Ice break
Bailin through the hood with my chocolate rice cakes
15 ninjas in a row
Jumpin out the bushes with they tae kwon do, yo
I jumps in my stance fo' protection
Kickin off my coat like "The Chinese Connection"
Wah-CHOP~! Watch 'em all drop, you can't stop a
Teacha teach ya get the grasshopper
I'm the illest nigga that you ever seen
Master of the flying guillotine
On with my journey, cops say I need an attorney
Fo' my celly, hit they ass with my Jim Kelly
At the Japanese deli fo' my troop
And we all take malt liquor, in our wonton soup
Oops as I smell my fork
It smells like sweet'n'sour pork
They rush me from the left.. and they rush me from the right
Here come the chef with the Ginsu knife
He wanna take my life, I put that on my momma
And serve my ass at Benihana's now
Which style will I use this week? Ahhh
The "Quicker Blood" technique
Here they come, one by one they get done
By the chosen one, nigga "Rising Sun"
It's 11 to 1, yet no one left
Servin these fools in my game of death
It seems like we fight everytime we meet
I bow when I greet, let's take it to the street

[Hook: Ice Cube]
Let's get ready to rumblllllle!
{*scratched: "Let's get it on" - Chuck D*}
Let's get ready to rumblllllle! Street Fighter
{*"Let's get it on"*}
Let's get ready to rumblllllle!
{*"Let's get it on"*}
Let's get ready to rumblllllle! Street Fighter
{*"Let's get it on"*}

[Ice Cube]
God damn there's a blind old man on my corner
And he could try to get with me, if he wanna
CAUSE THEY COME FROM MILES AROUND to try to stop me
I just keep bailin with my 40 ounce of sake
I got my eyes on his ass real steady
I'm ready; he pulls out the black machete
With my luck, I think I'm stuck
It's a quarter to twelve so I pulls out my nunchuks
Start to work 'em with style and finesse
But the old man's blind so he's not impressed
I swing; he hits me with the BOOM PING PING~!
Fallin to the ground I can hear my ears ring
He smiles, my neighbor dials 911
Fool don't you know my guillotine weighs a ton
You're no match - I throw and I snatch
Decapitate his ass - nigga catch! Ahh
Many black belts wanna try and snatch the pebble
From the mas-ter, but I'm much fas-ter
Just ask Bruce Lee
Him, and Brandon died, befo' I can who-ride

[Interlude]
{*"We are at war!"*} {*"We are at war!"*}
{*"We are, we are..."*} {*"We are at war!"*}
Street Fighter
{*"We are at war!"*} (Anyone, who opposes me)
{*"We are at war!"*} (will be destroyed)
{*"We-we, we-we, we-we, we are at war!"*}

[Ice Cube]
I'm breakin everybody down to they very last chromosomes
So send your, punk-ass ninjas
I mess around and make turtle soup!
Do a flip, flop, tuck back on a drum loop
Master of the flying guillotine is my chorus
I want to kill Chuck Norris
And my trick is the invisible fist
Eatin Fatburgers with my chopsticks
Doin drive-bys with my poison darts
That's bamboo, I want to {*censored*} Van Damme too
So don't mess around and let me hit you
With this skillafied Westside jiujitsu
HA HA HAH!! SO WHO WANTS TO FIGHT ME~?!
Before you come in my house nigga take off your Nikes
And bow, and I'll show you how to withstand this
Cannabis, phantomous praying mantis
It's like Chinese arithmetic
Cause you never ever thought you'd see the Dragon saggin
Life is cheap, I bow when I greet
So let's take it to the streets, HAH!

[Hook] - 2X minus Cube saying "Street Fighter"
