Let's blaze it now
More power to my people
Who proceed to keep it real
And fight for freedom through the days in hell
My patience fell
As a kid I was troubled
Had to battle through the bulling and live through the struggle
We were broke
My moma did what she could
I hit the street to flip some dollars
Chasin' grits in the hood
A lot of kids had it good
And I was jealous
No lie

And I was lost in my pride
But paid attention
To the hustlers hustlin'
And touchin' dollars
They follow
Servin' customers

Put the worry in my moma
Trynna live with [?]
But I was selfish and hungry
As a kid and distressed
With a fear of rejection
From my peers
While in question
I can hear them reflectin'
On cheers they projected
Wasn't easy as a kid
I fought for balance through change
To handle anger in my heart
I was channel my pain
