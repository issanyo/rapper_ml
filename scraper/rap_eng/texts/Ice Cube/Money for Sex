[Verse 1]
Let the buyer beware
And prepare for the scare of 1991, yo
Brothers get dumb without no remorse, yo
Gas they hand and then they thrown off course, yo
I coulda told ya so, I'm no dummy
Girls out there will act funny for the money
If ya rollin' in dough, she'll treasure ya
Instead of a pager she carries a cash register
It's cool for the fool who just happens
To be a crack dealer or rappin'
Back in the day it wasn't no problem
Cause it was okay, to just have a job then
But, nowadays ya gotta have the status
But, natives ain't goin' for the madness
Hey, they're barely outta their teens
16 and 17 year olds livin' like queens
Cause, honey trips without the checks
And ayo, money trips without the sex
So next is somethin' that natives don't need
Headaches and heartaches and I refuse to partake
In money for sex in any form or fashion
All ya hopes and dreams I'm like smashin'
And I know otha brothas know how I feel
So you can step cause (it ain't no big deal)

[Hook:]
"Money for sex, money for sex, ring it up..."

[Verse 2]
Where, oh where did the good girls go?
It seems all that's left in the meadow is hoes
Not the kinda ho that you use in your garden
Yes the kinda ho that'll make your dick harden
But it's more than a dolla for a holla
And more than a thousand for a peak up her blouse, and
More than a million if ya have children
Cause nowadays girls wanna make like a killin'
So babies come in handy
And they'll just eat up your dough like candy, give her some Brandy
And let her roll around in the Benz
And she'll give up the crotch and brag to all her friends
Thinkin' they can play me like a field trip
That's why I slugged my honey dip
Cause that's more than I can stand and I'm the man who sets it right again
Bust they in the lip and the bitch will never bite again
You ain't gettin' with my Nubian brothers
Cause before you even hit them covers
I warned 'em
Told 'em what was up before you bitches even swarmed him
Cause they'll be next
If I didn't hip my brothers to the sex
So you can try to rob and steal
But we were right on ya heels because (it ain't no big deal)

[Hook:]

[Verse 3]
You say crack sellers are swell fellas
Takin' you to school in his 5.0
Like I don't know that your boyfriend is paid
Ya musta told me 18 times, the other day
Bamboo earrings and gold teeth
And I know you must be givin' up the whole piece
He's just payin' for the sex
And I know you prostitutes is playin' with the sex
So who's next? Don't think that you can play the Homosapien
Cause I got plenty of friends
That's like waiting in the trenches
And I know your intentions
You wanna be down with a rapper
So you clap your
Thighs around my legs like a sandwich, but I'm not famished
Your schemes and plots are outlandish
Tan is the color of my skin, but
False is the color of your grin
So you can't win. This ain't no joke
And honey dip you can quote
Note for note
And squeal like a billygoat
And tell your friends that Del is stuck up
But in reality you fucked up
Now nubians ain't givin' money for the sex
And ayo, Nubians ain't givin' money for the sex
You stuck out in the cold
Like a mole on my asshole
Cause brothers ain't givin' up another red cent for the sex
Now, don't you look foolish?
Ya gold diggin' ass looks ghoulish
Pale as a ghost cause ya post high like a man is a big wheel
Because (it ain't no big deal)

[Hook]
