[Ice Cube]
Ice Cube in effect and I'm the posse leader
Love my woofer and hate my tweeter
Rap, don't sing, and groupies do flock
Gold rings and things keep the girlies on my jock

[Kid Dee]
Posse 2 Kid Dee is cunning
It's all about girls and making cash money
(Crenshaw) Crenshaw is where I chill
Never ever sick but always ill (ill)

[Sir Jinx]
Sir Jinx, no debatin
Beats I cut keep the woofers vibratin
3rd to the cut, but that's alright
Cause C.I.A. is on the mic

[Ice Cube]
Females on my tip and it ain't funny
(Why?) I don't know, probably cause I got money
Don't want me, just want my riches
Things like that keep stitches on my britches

[Kid Dee]
I wear all 501's
Many wear Adidas, but I have none
Filas, I'm coolin, girls are droolin
Rulin all classes cause I am schoolin

[Sir Jinx]
Yes boy, and I am with it
Reachin for the crown and I damn sho' get it
Be the king, rap, don't sing
And when I come around here's who I bring

[Ice Cube]
(My) posse on the move with fly girls
Fresh Fila gear and my hair in curls
Would get a motel but I'm too cheap
About to let her have it in the backseat
Chick's gettin ill and I assume
This girl won't go to the motel room
Me in the backseat turned up the sound
But my man K-Dee nowhere to be found

[Kid Dee]
Skeezer poppin drag and it ain't no joke
If I had to pay attention she'd wind up broke
Talkin quite dirty and that's the clue
Started kissin and huggin on Posse 2 (2)
Headed for the skirt, had to admit it
Willin not illin, she was damn sho' with it
Whispered in my ear, talkin that sex
Hurry up in the back, homeboy, I'm next

[Sir Jinx]
Jinx teed off cause my girl's no fun
I'm the only one that's on a dry run
She had a beef, I had a gripe

[Ice Cube]
But I heard different, she's not that type

[Sir Jinx]
I dissed her and dismissed her, threw her out of the place
Start poppin that trash, threw my hand in her face
Grabbed another girl who loved the posse
Headed to the Fox and the rest's history

My posse
My posse
(Posse's gettin big and my posse's gettin bigger)
My posse

[Ice Cube]
Posse 1 Ice Cube and I'm the ace
[Kid Dee]
Posse 2 roll the deuce, Kid Dee's in the place
[Sir Jinx]
Sir Jinx in the back and I'm the trey
[Ice Cube]
I talk more crap and down with Dre
[Kid Dee]
(The Wreckin' Crew) is with it, hip to get busy
[Sir Jinx]
Eazy-E, Ron De Vu keep chasin those skizzies
[Ice Cube]
???? just make that noise
[Sir Jinx]
This rhyme is dedicated to the Vick Boys
[Ice Cube]
To all the girls out there wanna get in our face
[Kid Dee]
To the Crenshaw cruisers, keep pumpin that bass
[Sir Jinx]
And to any rap team, if you wanna be king
[Ice Cube]
You must stand in line if you know what I mean
