[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I rarely have patience and you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason why I hate to wait for it?
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didnâ€™t hurt me
You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I could shortcut my success motherfunk all y'all, wassup

[Chorus: George Clinton & Funkadelic]
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
I was hard when I started
I'll be hard when I get through
For example if I had a sample of some of that funk like you
Would I be funky too?
And another thing
It ain't so hard, it ain't so strange
If I could be funky like you
If I could be funky like you
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
He was hard when he started
He'll be hard when he get through
He was hard when he started
He gon' be hard when he get through

[Verse 2: Ice Cube & George Clinton]
Bottom where I treat em, you know if I need em
See, Dr. Funkenstein that's my spiritual leader
Some suckers don't like it, cause I'm a psychic
And if you tricks don't like it, ho you can dyke it
It's that self-made Kool-aid, look what red and blue made
Turned O'Shea into N.W.A
Triple OG, ain't never sold a key
Ain't never did time, they still respect mine
Ask all the niggas on the mainline
Who they favorite and what he's made with
Playboy, I ain't nothing to play with
I'm dangerous when it comes to using this language
Me and Starchild, we talk to strangers
All the real hoods is ready to bang this
You might not understand if you come from Cambridge
I'm flesh and blood, that's hard as stainless
(It's good to be hard) It's good to be hard homie
(It's hard to be good) But damn, it's hard to be good

[Chorus: George Clinton & Funkadelic]
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
I was hard when I started
I'll be hard when I get through
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
I was hard when I started
Gon' be hard when I get through
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
He was hard when he started
Said he'll be hard when he get through
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
He was hard when he started
And he'll be hard when he get through
He was hard when he started
He gon' be hard when he get through
