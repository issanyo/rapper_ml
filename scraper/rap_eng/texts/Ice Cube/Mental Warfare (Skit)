I love the sound of gangsta shit in the mornin'
Bitch, you know the size, world motherfucking wide

You ain't got to be in the pen to be in prison
You in the prison of your mutherfuckin' mind
What kinda time we got up here?
15:30 am

Everything is real on this concrete and steel
Everything is real on this concrete and steel
The warfare is mental
The warfare is mental

Supreme gangster shit
We dream gangster shit
Now I wanna see if you punk mutherfuckers is paying attention
I love the sound of gangsta shit in the mornin'
