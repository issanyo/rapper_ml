[Intro]
Ahh, I know I'm drunk now
Ladies and gentlemen, I for-I forgot my
My favorite man, sittin' over there
His name is...

[Chorus]
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mr. Bob Dobalina

[Verse 1]
Mista Dobalina, Mista Bob Dobalina
Mista Bob Dobalina, won't you quit?
You really make me sick with ya fraudulent behavior
You're gonna make me flip and then an army couldn't save ya
Why don't you behave ya little rugrat?
Take a little tip from the tabloid, because I know I'm not paranoid
When I say I saw ya tryin' to mock me
Now you and your crew are on a mission tryin' to hawk me
But it isn't happenin' ya fraudulent foes
You used to front big time now I suppose
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted
You used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it
So you gotta kick it with the homies
But D-E-L is already hip to your cronies
Me and CM-PX thought about this and never have we seen a
Brother who could hover Mista, Mista, Mista Dobalina

[Chorus]
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mr. Bob Dobalina

Gloryhallastoopid, Mista Bob Dobalina

[Bridge 2]
Ooh, ooh, Mista Dobalina, you thought ya could manipulate
You thought you could fool me, ooh, ooh, Mista Dobalina
Teacher used to put me on a stump
And then he schooled me

[Verse 2]
Friends can be fraudulent, just you wait and see
First he was my moneygrip then he stole my honeydip
Mista Dobalina is a serpent, don't you agree?
The little two-tima resembles Aunt Jemima
With jeans and a dirty white hoodie
Seems like he wouldn't be a snake or would he?
Disguises come in all sizes and shapes
Notice the facade of the snakes
They all catch the vapes, even though last year they was GQ
Took a lot of time before the D-E-L could see through
The mask, all I had to do was ask Hemperor and Kwam√©
And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that you try to impress Uncle Fester, Dobalina
Because ya don't impress me Dobalina
The style of dress is not the key Dobalina
It's all in the mind and the heart, so you should start
By remembering ya gotta pay a fee Dobalina

[Chorus]
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mr. Bob Dobalina
