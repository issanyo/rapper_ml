[Opening Dialogue: a quote from 1992 St. Louis Trespass Movie]

[King James]
Yo Savon, you're my man and everything else
But you just can't run up in this building and shoot
And fools got my brother hostage, man

[Savon] Fuck that!!

[King James]
I don't want nobody shoots 'til I say so, you understand?
I'm running this crew

[Savon]
And you ain't running shit but your mouth
Cause shit ain't worked all day and it's on

[Ice Cube]
Five niggas on the roof with the proof
And one went out
White boy wanna know what it's all about
Back in St. Louis
Down with King James so everybody knew us
Who that wanna do us? - GOOSE!!
The first motherfucker done went loose
Catch him on the roof, got my news from my Deuce Deuce
Savon, can't be clowned

[Ice-T]
Saw the motherfucker got the critical beat down
On and on the drama continues to ring
For me, I'm known as James the King
I got a partner by my right hand
Though Savon is the hype man
But he thinks that he can do something I can't do
"What's that?" - command the crew
Now, I'm finding out who was really true
Two white boys got my brother on a hostage's tip

[Ice Cube]
Fuck that, I wanna give them full clips
So you better stay calm with the shooters
Ugh, and here come the looters

[Ice Cube]
Ugh, bailed through the skylight
He spends some time, so could you give me a highlight
White boy got to stick his nose in, claimed he seen nothing
Got to break him off something
Rushed down the steps, hands up, sound dumb
Shaking like a bitch is how we found him
Showed him the Machete, he stepped back from the riot
Claimed he ain't never seen a nigga like that
With Don and Cletus, we stepped about seven for two
And I'm the meanest motherfucker in my crew
Do him, boom, hit another shot
Ran for cover (* Gun Shot*)

[Ice-T]
Awww shit, got my little brother
I'm not nice tonight, cause you got me in a Gun Fight
Yeah, the cap peeler, big drug dealer
I already had to kill the man
Called up Raymond who is crazy as I am
He got the ammo', he got much guns
Trunk the funk, now, my posse is ready to pump the chumps
I wanna kill them suckers badder than any of them
Let them showed me my brother's health
Savon, don't care, he is my nightmare
I'm trying to slow him up

[Ice Cube]
I wanna blow them up
So you better stay calm with the shooters
Motherfucker

[Ice Cube]
Pour more juice to the scene
Cause Raymond got a trunk full of M16s
Now, bitch give me room
He got Wickey, K.J. and Luther and White Moon
Cletus and Savon
Seven motherfuckers that drag like Ping Pong

[Ice-T]
There's a lot of bullets flying
Echoes screeching, there's a lot of motherfuckers dying
All I want is my brother back
13 men in the St. Louis death track

[Ice Cube]
So you better stay calm with the shooters
The shooters, the shooters, the motherfucking looters
