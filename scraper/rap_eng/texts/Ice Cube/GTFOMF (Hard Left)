Follow no leader, and bow to no king
Pray to no god, wake up from that dream
You stick with that scheme?
You a punk fish swimming upstream
Against the shit machine, my funk fit's picking up steam
No idols excite me, they ain't even like me
They lie to me pridefully daily and nightly
Strike me as hustlers, them ads that they run
Let's hang all these fuckers, they masters of none

Buy yo everywhere I go, they all in my ear

When I get my rhyme on, your icons be bygone
Cowardly lions - Get the fuck off my lawn
Progressive I live, with no fucks left to give
So when White women "Whitesplain" what "Mainsplaing" is
I'm like, "Bitch, do I look like your global oppressor?"
Where you think I learned the word "BItch" from, Kenya?
Keep guessing
This language that we anguish with ain't even ours
And neither are the streets, cars, weed or tar
Drinks, bars, links, or cause
Think and pause, before you pin it all on a little nigga talk
That's Enlgish you penis, we negroes rip it off
So opinions, advice, criticism, all types
You can pitch it, that nice, but I dig no device
Infringing on my right to get hype, wanna fight
I toss and I turn with concern in the night
I like that I struggle, I hate that I struggle
No
