[Verse 1: Poochie Bivens]
I'm looking through the door and my first estimation is the bed
Baby, please tell me that you're feeling for it
My legs are naked and I just want your love to replace the way they're shaking
Don't fake it, babe you can't ignore it
Don't care if it's [?]
I've been waiting all day long for your love
I don't think I could get enough
Love the way you say my name
Sensually, kissing me

Oh babe, your love, it drives me crazy
That's how I know you do it best
Your kiss, your touch, your're so amazing

[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller]
You're walking through the door
Girl, ain't no question you already know that Imma do you [?]
Already laid your lingerie out on the bed
So put those on instead
And I'll rock your body [?]
You don't gotta ride, I'll be happy to [?] and drive to you [?] and do what you like

Slow down, and kiss you until you close your eyes and [?]
Baby look no further

We could go again if you'd like

[Chorus: Poochie Bivens & Bryson Tiller]
I think I'm ready for your love

The way you do it to me, you do it best

[Outro: Poochie Bivens & Bryson Tiller]
I think I'm ready for your love
