I don’t know man, it’s just... (laughs)
Why are you so paranoid (I can’t help it)
Why are you so paranoid (ay, they didn’t know I could sing girl)
Don't be so...

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]
They say to me
Don’t worry 'bout it
I’ll be famous
Keep on dreamin’ about it
I worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
I worry ‘bout the wrong things, the wrong things
I’m tryna do my own thing, my own thing
And put on for my home team, my own team

[Refrain 1]
Ya
Everybody tellin’ me I should never think about it
(I’d rather somebody tell me I can’t be successful)
Sometimes, I just don’t really give a fuck
(Even though I can, ha)
(Where my fans at? That’s what they tell me)
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
(They know, they know)
They never know you
(Famous, one day)
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
(They know, that I'll be...)
They never know you

[Verse: Bryson Tiller]
I’m paranoid, yo
And sometimes I be thinking this ain’t for me
But when I hit 'em with the flow
Everybody up, everybody standin’ at their feet
They never would’ve guessed
Somebody so talented would ever give up, no
I made a whole mixtape just to show a nigga I deserve a deal
Show 'em I could go
If they sleepin’ on me then I’m Freddy, Kroeger
Time to win it all, man
Forget these losers
Haters won’t befriend me
But that goes against my killer instinct

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]
Anyway, they don’t know you like I do
They never know you
Anyway, they don’t know you like I do
They never know you
