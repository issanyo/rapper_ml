[Verse 1]
Did you not, not tell me not to say another lie, lie to me
Not to play with you and I, I
Know somebody like you is hard to find
Put her guard up for my eye
Know them niggas watchin'
They been scheming up and plotting
They been big shit-talkin' and hatin'
Got a nigga cautious, thinkin' you would leave me
Trust and believe me
I know this shit is easy, I know they want the Fiji
All them niggas thirsty, but you would never hurt me
Not like how I hurt you, the shit I do is hurtful
You feel like a damn fool
I wish I had a manual to better understand you ('stand you)
You say I'm a handful, I'm in your head like Cantu
I tell you what I can do
Be a better man to you, this Henny made me ramble

[Chorus]
Called and got no answer
Wrote this fuckin' anthem, alert you like it's amber (like amber)
Distress to my damsel
But she say I'm canceled

[Verse 2]
I just got back in touch with her
Used to talk a lot, you still down to ride?
I can't do this hi and bye
Don't see eye to eye but I know that we got time
To fix it, we not blind
Don't know what I'm implyin'
I'm missin' my friend dyin'
Without you, I been tryin'
These bitches, they been wack
Can't take 'em to get Prime for dinner, we did that
Can't help it but nitpick the shit that they did lack
Like throwin' that shit back
You know that I miss that
I don't like the wig snatched
No, I like that shit natural
Big mad 'cause I heard a nigga just bagged you
Big mad 'cause you lie about it when I asked you
Fucked on her, but knew it wouldn't last
Even though she came fast, nigga, karma came faster
Seen you with the nigga in a pic, no caption
But the look up on your face say he better than the last one, damn

[Chorus]
Called and got no answer
Wrote this fuckin' anthem, alert you like it's amber (like amber)
Distress to my damsel (to my damsel, oh-oh)
But she say I'm canceled

[Post-Chorus]
I'm canceled, canceled
I'm canceled (fuck does that even mean anyway?)
I'm canceled, oh yeah, yeah (canceled)

[Verse 3]
Don't sweat it
I forgave you but won't forget it
I just cut into your schedule
Got your new number from your best friend, yeah
Yeah, I been checkin' for you
Know you been checkin' for me too
Why they like to meddle up in what we do?
Like they know the best for me and you
I just turned into your driveway
You were lookin' at me sideways
You were throwin' dirt on my name
Since I'm the one to blame
I, I apologize, yeah
I, sorry for the lies, yeah
For the lies, yeah
For the lies
