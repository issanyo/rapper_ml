[Verse]
Oh you told me, girl you told me
Could've sworn that you told me
Well, I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you
Now I ain't through, I ain't through
I, I ain't through, I ain't through
I ain't done with you, yes sir
Aye, I say, with me it's different
Let me show you the difference
I just want you to listen now
(yeah, I love you, I love you)
I just want you to listen now
(yeah, I love you, I love you)
Can you tell the difference?
No, you can tell the difference
Oh yes, I say, with me it's different
Baby, I know you see the difference
