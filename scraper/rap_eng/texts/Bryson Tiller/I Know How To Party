[Verse 1]
Pretty woman, grown and sexy
I hope you're a cougar babe
I'm a young man, if you let me
I'll show you how I do them things

I know you think I may not know what I am doing
But I promise you'll be sure tomorrow morning
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you have plans baby?
Lets get freaky tonight
If you want me we can head for the door
Take my hand lady
I will lead you tonight
Be my cougar I won't tell anyone

[Chorus]
Say yeaaaaaah yeah
Say yeaaaaaah yeah
Say yeaaaaaah yeah
Say yeaaaaaah yeah

[Hook]
I know I'm young but baby I know how to party
I know how to party

Pretty woman I tell you I know how to party
I know a thing or two what to do with you tonight

[Verse 2]
Well goddamn, you're exciting
You've really got experience
Girl can you handle all night lust
Makes you feel like you're 17 again

Don't belittle me, I'm not a beginner
Tonight I'm having your body for dinner
Hey hey yeaah

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you have plans baby?
Lets get freaky tonight
If you want me we can head for the door

[Bridge]
It's all over your face girl
I know you wanna try me
But take me back to your place girl
And watch me travel your body, ooh get it started

I know how to party girl i swear
Maybe I'm a baby, trust I do not care
Sit back I'll run my fingers through your hair
Baby show your emotions, I know what you want

[Hook]
I know I'm young but baby I know how to party

Pretty woman I tell you I know how to party
I know a thing or two what to do with you tonight
