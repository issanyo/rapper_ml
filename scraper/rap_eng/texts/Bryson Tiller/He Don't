[Intro: Bryson Tiller]
I'm sick as hell right now
Just going to keep it real with em
I just thought I had to tell you
I just don't want to see you get hurt, that's it
Shit I don't like it, shit just looking out for her
You know what I'm saying
I just think you should know this

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]
Girl, he don't fucking love you
No, he don't fucking love you
You are just another bitch
He'll probably let his other homie run through
Why you let him lie to you, girl?
I bet your friends call you stupid
You is way too beautiful
Behind your back, he call you a hoe
That's cause he don't fucking love you

[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller]
Try to trust me on this one
Go and find someone different
And don't ask for his permission
He a dog, he tell you that in all of his songs
And yeah, that's my boy but I can't let him do you wrong
I be telling him to drop all of them other hoes
But them thirsty bitches, he would rather fuck with those
I agree when he say he can never trust a hoe
But that's no excuse not to love you though
I should mind my own damn business
Cause I'm happy with my girl
She brought the happy in my world
Niggas like you are the reason love's looking kinda tacky for these girls
Are you happy this occurred?
Boy, I never met a nigga so ungrateful
Why you fucking with them devils when you got an angel?
You say you care about her
But do you know what you about to tear up out her?
It's a heartbeat, smart, dumb nigga

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]
Girl, he don't fucking love you
No, he don't fucking love you
You are just another bitch
He'll probably let his other homie run through
Why you let him lie to you, girl?
I bet your friends call you stupid
You is way too beautiful
Behind your back, he call you a hoe
That's cause he don't fucking love you

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Oh he's offended now
He say he gonna make me wish I never did it now
He say he got a lot of dirt on me
Tell my girl I actually love her
That'll be worse for me
And tell yourself that anything you do is never hurting me
I'm dead, I'm already dead
I didn't kill myself, I just went and killed this song instead
The dogs been bred
Thanks for the lessons brother
Rule number one
Fuck these bitches go and get the money
I love her smile
Do you love it too?
You wanna see that smile then tell her not to fuck with you
Cause when it's said and done I'll be the one she tells her story to
And when somebody else is in the picture she's ignoring you
You know you done fucked up don't ya?
You know you done screwed up
Went and told her she's the bomb
And now she's feelin' like she's one step closer
Now everything done blew up

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]
Yeah, he don't fucking love you
Nah, he don't fucking love you
You are just another bitch
He'll probably let his other homie run to
Why you let him lie to you girl?
I bet your friends call you stupid
You is way too beautiful
Behind your back he call you a hoe
That's cause he don't fucking love you

[Verse 3]
Mind yo fuckin' business
Don't need no help with these bitches
Nigga get the fuck off my set
Gon' put up with this BS 'til I know that she got my back
And fuck around and end up bending my back
She'll like that
See love is just a game, look at my stats
But her and I've been hurtin' just reserve I got a ice pack
What my heart 'posed to be you should try that
Cause far as I could see you are right behind where I'm at
Now first our relationship was plain, pilot
Oh, but she'll still fly that, hijack
And when I'm in her presence that is exactly how I act
Like she's a gift to me
And plus she likes the fact that I rap
See I don't have to call her all the time
Or even be around to let her know she's on my mind
Just know that we got a bond that y'all don't find
And I tell her she's the bomb cause she mine

[Bridge]
Man I fuckin' love you
But I won't put no one above you
You should see the way I treat these other bitches if I ever let 'em come through
Cause I know that you gon' ride for me girl
You the one I'm in the coupe with
You could shake if you wanna go
Aye your dad said you gettin' old
That this is what I think of you
