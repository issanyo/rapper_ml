[Intro]
Hi, aight, whatever, you doing too much
You doing too much
Ayy

[Verse 1]
Let's go back to the time when your nigga used to trip
'Bout the time we spent, girl, when we were just friends
It was all friendly on my end
Even though I look forward to seeing you again like, uh
When am I seeing you again?
Ayy, when are we speaking again?
Yeah, you look good with that ink on your skin
Hood, but you far from the streets you was in, oh yeah
No, he don't like it, call me up, he don't like it
This was the perfect timing
Love you, I'm certain I can, yeah
Talk about you like a queen makin' him madder
As if he never even mattered
And you a bad bitch, you keep getting badder
This ain't the side nigga anthem
I've been straight forward, he's going backwards

[Interlude]
Relax, yo, just chill
I love you, I’m with you
I ain’t with this nigga
You don’t think I…
He’s my best friend, he’s my brother
That’s my brother!
He ain’t your brother
That your blood?
You got the same momma and daddy?
Aight babe
You fuckin that nigga, that’s what it is
I’m fucking my brother? That’s my brother…
No, no, if y'all ain’t got the same momma and daddy, y'all can fuck
You fuckin’ him

[Verse 2]
You was on the verge of losing her
You was acting like you ain't want shit to do with her
I cut out the bullshit and kept it true with her
That's why the sexual tension is high when I'm in rooms with her
She really the shit, I don't be juicing her
I'm the shit too, that's why I'm so in tune with her
I feel like I'm sewn on ya
I feel like you grew on me
Have I grown on you?
Done fronting like I don't want you
Keep treating me like I don't know you
Back and forth between me and all your niggas
You're busy tonight, that figures
Tonight you're staying in his city
And still I answer your call when he doesn't answer at all
But I want that too, that's all
I need the same in return, that's all

[Outro]
That's all
That's all I want, all I want, all I want
That's all I want, all I want, yeah
All I want (just a, just a little time)
