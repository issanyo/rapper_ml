[Intro]
This is not, this is not
This is not, this is not a motherfuck-
A motherfucking game, motherfucker, this is not
This is not, a motherfucking game, why you playin' boy?
I'm just saying boy
Yeah

[Interlude]
Hol'on, hol'on, hol'on
Hol'on, hol'on, hol'on, hol'on
Hol'on nuh, hol'on nuh

[Chorus]
Rambo, they begging for mercy, like the Lambo
Know they told me, "Kill them all," goddamn, though
I know they want to see me fall, look where I am, though
On two feet, that's where I stand though
I'm a true fucking killer, like Rambo
No ammo, they see me on the Sanyo
Nigga, I just kill 'em because I can, though

[Verse 1]
I'm as humble as they come, but you're fucking with the wrong one
Boy you're fucking with the wrong one
This that new Pen Griffey,  watch that nigga get a home run
Watch him hit it, that's a home run
I ain't playin' wit' you nigga's
I'm a true Louis Villain
I'm the realest, they acrylic
Fuck them niggas if they doubt it
Say I'm flippin' up, but so is a money counter
I've been getting up, 'bout pay my self allowance
And I save it like the bell, I can't take no more L's
The day I sell my soul, that's the day I go to hell
Been putting on a show, just like Dave, I'm Chappelle
They ain't make it in the credits, I'ma tell them oh well
Tell Steve, don't let no more bitches in the hotel
Niggas gotta get the work, girl unless you gon' twerk something
While I lay this verse on em'
Damn this lifestyle got a lot of perks on it, I'm just saying nigga (Young Tiller)

[Chorus]
Rambo, they begging for mercy, like the Lambo
Know they told me, "Kill them all," goddamn, though
I know they want to see me fall, look where I am, though
On two feet, that's where I stand though
I'm a true fucking killer, like Rambo
No ammo, they see me on the Sanyo
Nigga, I just kill 'em because I can, though

[Verse 2]
This ain't temporary, I've been out here letting them know
New cat, years later, bet Sylvester Stallone
I've been working hard, I've been doing better, ya know
Peep the freeloaders, we won't be breaking bread with them, no
She chose me over him, cause he was so regular, oh
He was so regular, I'm like a butler getting his dough
I'm like a monster, or a motherfucking Predator
Oh-na-na-na, Soldier like Contra
I don't fuck with thotties, I pass them to my partner
All gold everything, bitch I'm Fort Knoxin'
New sports car man
I'm new Porsche coppin', two door hop in
Girl you know how I spend
And I've been trying to budget my checks and the rest of my money, money
Rubber bands getting stretched with the hundreds, hundreds
M.V.P upper deck with the money, money
Don't I make the haters upset with the money
Bitch, I'm coming cause

[Outro]
This is not, this is not a
This is not a motherfuck-
A motherfucking game, this is not, this is not
This is not, a motherfucking game, why you playin' boy?
I'm just saying boy
Tiller!
