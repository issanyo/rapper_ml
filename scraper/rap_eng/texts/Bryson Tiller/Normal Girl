[Verse 1]
I love the way you pop your top
And how you lose your cool
And how you look at me, too
Say why?
It ain't no fighting, no I can't stop it
This took a while, yeah
Love the way you pump your fist or how you bust your hip
For my affection, tryna be down
No fighting, no stoppin'
Stick around

[Pre-Chorus]
And you the type of girl I'll take over to mama
The type of girl, I know your daddy be proud of
Yeah, uh be proud of, yeah
Uh be proud of, uh be proud, you know, you know
The type of girl I wanna turn into a mama
The type of girl, I'm already proud of
Uh be proud of, uh be proud of, uh be proud of, boy you know

[Chorus]
I wish you was a normal girl
I wish you was a normal girl
Normal girl, oh, oh, oh
I wish you was a normal girl

[Verse 2]
You like it, when I get, aggressive
You like it when I tell you
How I want it, tell you how I need it
Tell you "I don't want to have to repeat it"
Baby, I, tell me I, never should worry, end of story
That's the end of story, that's the end of story, yeah

[Outro]
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Wish you was a normal, girl
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
