Yeah
Don't play with'em don't be dishonest
She not understanding this logic
I'm back and I'm better
I want you bad as ever
Ain't nobody better
We should be together
Baby it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Ooh baby no pressure
If my nigga know that he messed up
He don't even know how to catch up
I am on a whole other level
We ain't happy with'em tell me why we settle

Fuck it then I guess you didn't know any better
No that she wasn't shit when you met her
You and I both know we can do better
Been through some similar shit boy whatever
Lately you sayin she been killing the vibe
Can't turn a hoe to no wife
Pull up scurt get in the ride
Secret location just chill in the passenger side
Light up a spliff if you like
Baby you deserve what you've been missing
She don't even care if you get yo nutrition
She don't cook nuthin up in yo kitchen

Don't!
She don't don't don't
Don't!

Boy say she spend up everything
She keep begging for a ring
Don't bring nothing to the table
What a shame, If you were mine you will not be the same
I put the call on the house say my name
Suicide in the drop switching lanes
And this thang so juicy baby wet like rain
Got good p***y baby can I be framed
Keep it 100 boy that ain't the only thing
That will keep a nigga around like he say up on a game

And you know that (oh baby)
Oooh woah, Oh baby
Oh baby

Don't!
