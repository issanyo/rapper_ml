[Verse 1]
I don't know if you can take it
I know you want to see me naked
I just want to be your baby
But I can't be around you

[Chorus]
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts

[Verse 2]
I hope you know I'm for the taking
Hope you know this cookie's baking
I just want to be your baby
But I can't be around you

[Chorus]
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts

[Chorus]
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
