[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller]
I took the 95 to get from West Palm
Think I need a break from everything
Yes, I'm stressed way more than usual
I'm gettin' things back in order
Getting things back to how they used to be
Back to when the scrutiny had no effect on you and me
I miss driving with you in the passenger (driving, yeah)
Feet up on my dash, we would see the sun lapse
Take you home, you would come see me before class
Makes more sense for you to crash with me but you never ask, oh why
Told you there's no need to be shy, oh why
I be waiting in the meantime, oh why
You always got me on stand by
When you know I need love
I'm missing when we was us
Miss when I wasn't famous, that's when we could be us
Kiss right in the street, fuck if anybody sees
Just friends, I don't think anybody believes
Hard to keep it PG with a nigga like me, goddamn

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
I fell in love with you, I fell in love, girl
I miss us
Nah, I won't front, got me so sprung
'Cause you, you're 1 of 1 (hey)
It's no rush (yeah, miss it)
I'm missing your touch (your touch)
I'm missing your touch, oh
Missing when you kept in touch, oh-woah-oh (oh, yeah)
When you kept in touch

[Interlude]
Phone ringing

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
I took the 401 to get from Yorkdale
You're still looking like the baddest thing I done seen
Deflated before it started flattening
Way before the singer-rapper thing started happening
We were playing checkers, I was just tryna get back to king
I miss black tinted windows on your whip looking Amish
I'm just tryna put it down
You can put it on my tab
I'm putting you on your back
Then putting it in you slow
Then putting it in on a track, oh yeah
And I always tried to fall through
Ain't no Ws and dubbing me when I call you
I'm in first class
Thinking 'bout how you would get me right
Damn near made me miss the flight
Fucking you and get it right, yeah
You gon' bring me to that first time we fucked on the futon
Back then, I would do anything to get you alone
You would know me, all bullshit aside
So hit my line, I miss us

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller & Tory Lanez]
I fell in love with you, I fell in love, girl
I miss us (baby, oh yeah)
Nah, I won't front, got me so sprung
'Cause you, you're 1 of 1 (you're 1 of 1)
It's no rush (yeah, miss it)
I'm missing your touch (your touch)
I'm missing your touch, oh
Missing when you kept in touch, oh-woah-oh (oh, yeah)
When you kept in touch
