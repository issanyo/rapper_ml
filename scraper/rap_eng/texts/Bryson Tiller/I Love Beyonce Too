[Intro]
Yeah
B. Tiller man, let's go
Ha ha ha
Fuck I did a song and called it "Friendzone"
But you know I'm tired of being in the friendzone so I had to do another one
Shout out to Drizzy, turn up

[Verse 1]
Look I be up when you call me
Who told you crying would solve it?
Girl feel free to start venting, it's okay I'm here to listen
I've been here from the beginning
Swear my love is consistent
These girls protest against niggas
I might just sign the petition
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new men, no no no
You've gotta let this go
I wanna be more than a shoulder you can cry on
Girl am I your type or do I not have the right to know?
This side is old girl

[Hook]
Say name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, â€œBaby I love you, I'm ready for a change"
Say my name, say my name
You acting kinda shady
Baby why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
Say it baby, say it baby
When no one is around you
One more time

[Verse 2]
Say my name, say my name
Damn that boy be slacking
Why can't you just move past it?
Time for a change
Call you when it's early
Even call you when I'm busy
But if you call me and I miss it, I hit you right back, can't believe we're just friends
This why I been saying no new men, no no no
You know this how ends so, don't-don't get me started 'bout trust (Wooh)
Boy don't doubt us (Wooh)
Come get my love
I'll give it baby, but I'm finished baby
Ain't got shit else to say (Yeah)
Ain't got shit else to say
Oh yeah ah, I know, I know

[Outro]
Did I just potentially ruin a good song?
I don't know but I'ma freestyle off my mind, off my mind
Take them clothes off one time
Baby you are, finally mine, you're finally mine
Yeah, you're finally mine
I don't really like this remake
I don't really like this remake
Got it off YouTube
Tiller why you ain't put out a mixtape yet?
Probably 'cause my whole team be slacking
Lazy ass niggas ain't tryna get this money
Bitch ass nigga rich still think this shit funny (Ha ha ha ha)
This ain't no motherfucking game nigga
Vote, Sasha Renee nigga, Sasha Renee nigga
Didn't even know the beat did this shit at the end
It's kinda cool but I gotta go my friend
Yah, yah, yah, ayy, ayy
