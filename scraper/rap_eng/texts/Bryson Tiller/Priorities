[Hook: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Man I feel I could've been a better man for you
Girl I could tell you don't know what to do
And though it might hurt I'mma tell you the truth
At least most of it
I use my priorities as an excuse, oh no no
Cause girl my priority should've been you
When I got on I was on one
Now I'm alone with no one
Ohhh priorities, priorities
Who are you?

[Verse 1: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Only I know 'bout, every lie I told
And I know it got cold and we don't know blinds those
We kiss with both eyes open
Trust me like you used to girl
Want me like you used to baby
Need me like the air you need to breath
Just like your heart gon' miss a beat if you don't
Get some of this sweet time baby
Know you want to be mine baby
Let's rewind hey
I put my work before you
I know I'm worth it but you
Feel like I hurt you its true
You saying that it's too late
Like I had a curfew with you
Oh no no no no

[Hook: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Girl I could tell you don't know what to do
And though it might hurt I'mma tell you the truth
At least most of it
I use my priorities as an excuse, oh no no
Cause girl my priority should've been you
When I got on I was on one
Now I'm alone with no one
Ohhh priorities, priorities
Who are you?

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Been ignoring these signs baby, been ignoring these signs
I'm starting to catch on now, love me in the mean time
Baby I mean, I'm crazy for not taking you serious
I guess I got live with it ohhh, oh
Guess I got live with it
I wish, I had more for you now this is it
I don't think I could live with this
Can't get any more real than this ohhh, oh

[Hook: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Girl I could tell you don't know what to do
And though it might hurt I'mma tell you the truth
At least most of it
I use my priority as an excuse, oh no no
Cause girl my priority should've been you
When I got on I was on one
Now I'm alone with no one
Ohhh priorities, priorities
Who are you?

[Verse 3: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Don't know how much longer I'll let you ignore me baby
I still can't believe I ain't put you before me baby
Your phone on 1% you better call me baby
It was all me said I'm sorry put it on me baby
When I feel like I could've been a better man for you
Made plans for you
Your number one fan for you
I'd never put hands on you, oh no no no
Got to prioritize on my starting five 'til your heart is mine
When I got on I was on one
Now I'm along with no one
Oh priorities, priorities
