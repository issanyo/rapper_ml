Maria Maria
You remind me of a West Side Story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star
Maria Maria
She fell in love with East L.A
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

I don't know if you could take it
Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked
I wanna be your baby, baby, baby
Spinning and it's wet just like it came from Maytag
White girl wasted on that brown liquor
When I get like this I can't be around you
I'm too lit to dim down a notch
'Cause I could name some thangs that I'm gon' do

Wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

I heard that pussy for the taking
I heard it got these other brothers goin' crazy
Yeah, I treat you like a lady, lady
Fuck you 'til you're burned out, cremation
Make it cream, yeah, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Throw that ass back, bouquet, bouquet
Call me and I can get it juicy
Yeah I know you're gone off the D'uss√©
Careful, mama, watch what you say
You talking to me like ya new bae
Girl, you talking like you tryna do things
Now that pipe got her running like she Usain, baby
You made me drown in it, ooh, touche, baby
I'm carrying that water, Bobby Boucher, baby
And you know I'mma slaughter like I'm Jason
Bust it, why you got it on safety?

White girl wasted on brown liquor
I probably shouldn't be around you
You looking like there's nothing that you won't do
That's when I told you
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

Wild, wild, wild
You remind me of a West Side Story
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
Wild, wild, wild
She's living the life just like a movie star
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
