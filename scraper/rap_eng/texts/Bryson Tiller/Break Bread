[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
Go out on the weekends I barely (Bah)
Peace and prosperity (Oow)
Drinking not heavily (She is)
She can’t stop texting me (Nah)
I don’t know why she sweating me (Ion't know why)
Live bitches can’t get with me (Bah, bah)
Niggas better stop testing me (Wooh, wooh)
Niggas can’t break bread with me (God Tiller)

[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller]
She ain't on the same shit Young Tiller on (nope, aight)
Kick her to the curb, if she ain’t willing to learn I'mma send her home
Grams in a zip lock bag for the time that I spend alone
And I’m just getting stoned (Killer)
Got green like Piccolo
Ya ain't talking money
Then the convo short like Krillin though (Short)
Killer song by the bank
Its killer all (Killer)
Nigga fuck a celebrity status (Wooh)
Long as my money long
Cut me a check I'ma cash it (Cut me a check I'ma cash it)
I don’t pay these niggas no mind
Cause I can’t write that off in my taxes
Headed to the bank just laughing
Ironically I’m from the city of Cassius
I done met a lot of temporary people
Like I’m in the fuckin' temp service
If you ain't real stay away I encourage
All my niggas stay down inverted
Hey save your energy conserve it
Keep your two cents don’t insert it
Check the blueprints I’m in the building
Squad in the building
We turn up for certain you spy on me
I am in your recent searches, nigga

[Bridge: Bryson Tiller]
What the hell is you telling me
When it comes to fame nigga
I care the least
Free loaders screaming
"Share with me, we go way back"
Stay back
You especially

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
Go out on the weekends I barely (Ayy)
Peace and prosperity (Ayy)
Drinking not heavily (She is, ayy)
She can’t stop texting me (Ayy)
I don’t know why she sweating me (Ion't know why)
Live bitches can’t get with me (Ayy)
Niggas better stop testing me (Ayy)
Niggas can’t break bread with me

[Verse 2: King Vory]
I am no god
A king at most I just wait for my rise
The beast's off the leash
Who invested some time with a hell of a grind
See these hoes are not yours (Yours)
And these hoes are not mine (Mine)
Rolly bust out cause it happen on time
Believed in my niggas (I did)
I knew  we were gon’ shine (I knew)
Shout out to my dawg
Who invested some time
I’m one of a kind but still on my grind (My grind)
Don’t start it or stop it
Drew Brees in my pocket
My bitch, she so tropic (She is)
Pull up in that optic (I do)
These bitches can’t stop it
We want it we cop it
On IG I’m trending (Wooh)
My name is the topic
Pull up in that aw shit (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
He bugging we off him
My flow I be on it
Don’t see no components (I don't)
R.I.P to L.A (L.A.)
They know I Capone it, they know I be on it (I do)
They say numbers don’t lie (They don't)
Including as pointers
My niggas got work (Whip)
Ain't talking employment
Now go make your appointment
She rub me like ointment

[Bridge: Bryson Tiller]
What the hell is you telling me (Come again?)
When it comes to fame nigga
I care the least (I swear I do)
Free loaders screaming
"Share with me, we go way back"
Stay back
You especially

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
Go out on the weekends I barely (Ayy)
Peace and prosperity (Ayy)
Drinking not heavily (She is, ayy)
She can’t stop texting me (Ayy)
I don’t know why she sweating me (Ion't know why)
Live bitches can’t get with me (Ayy)
Niggas better stop testing me (Ayy)
Niggas can’t break bread with me
