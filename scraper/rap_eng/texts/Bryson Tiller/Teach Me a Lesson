[Verse 1]
I had asked myself
So, what would you do if she left?
What would you do?
Would I find someone to distract myself?
Detach myself
Get my mind off you
This is far from the end
Got a nigga in a frenzy
Only you would understand
Oh, when I used to be your man
You tell me, tell me
Over and over again

[Pre-Chorus]
If it's too much pressure, babe
Maybe I'm not the one for you, baby
If you gotta question me, babe
Think of all I've done for you, baby
I said that I know it
You're going to find someone
That's ready for you

[Chorus]
And teach me a lesson, baby
You're gonna find someone who gets it, babe
Teach me a lesson, babe
Baby, ooh
Teach me a lesson, babe
Yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
You just left town
Yeah, you skated on me
Bounce, switch locations on me
Can't keep waiting on me
Made a mistake, baby
Now you're tryna find a replacement for me, babe
Oh, hold up
Why we broke up
Guess I don't know, love?
Guess I don't know
Baby, I had to grow up
I don't want you with no one
No one, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
If it's too much pressure, babe
Maybe I'm not the one for you, baby
If you gotta question me, babe
Think of all I've done for you, baby
I said I know that
You're going to find someone
That's ready for you

[Chorus]
Teach me a lesson, baby
Teach me, baby
You're going to find someone
Who gets it, babe
Teach me a lesson, baby

[Outro]
Oh no no no
