[Intro]
Yeah, woah
Yo, woah

Aye shawty
Lemme get them panties wet

[Verse 1]
Fuck that nigga
Let me hit yo spot
You know when I'm in it
This shit don't stop
Now I'm all up in the bed
Got a nigga on rock
Wanna do the things
He's not doing
I put my tongue down
Licking all between your thighs (woah)
Giddity now, I'll be your pony
Take me for a ride, now I say
(fuck that nigga)
Seriously, wanna lick the rapper
He ain't fucking with me lyrically
"la,la,la" do you like it when I sing
When I'm playing with the thang
And get you wetter, yessir

[Pre-Hook]
I can be the one to give it when you need it
I can play it fair
I can mistreat it
I can leave 'fore we done
If you want me too
Whatever you want I got you

[Hook]
Said, said, said, you alone I can spend the night yet
Don't know what he doing
Let me get you right, yeah
He can love all he wants now baby
But I'm a fuck you like he don't now baby

[Chorus]
Fuck that nigga
Fuck that nigga
Fuck that nigga doe

[Verse 2]
You got on them Vicky secrets
Looking like a home magazine cover
Already ran through about three rubbers
Now I know we're just cuddy buddies
But this sex gon' make you love me
A back rub? do you want a back rub?
Booty got that mass of a macktruck
It's whatever, we ain't gotta do it my way
Don't wanna waste time, baby I say
Yeah
Leave your nigga shawty he don't hit like he need
Uh
He don't fuck you like you need to be done

[Pre-Hook]
I can be the one to give it when you need it
I can play it fair
I can mistreat it
I can leave fore we done
If you want me too
Whatever you want I got you

[Hook]
Said,said,said, you alone I can spend the night yet
Don't know what he doing
Let me get you right, yeah
He can love all he wants now baby
But I'm a fuck you like he don't now baby

[Chorus]
Fuck that nigga
Fuck that nigga doe

[Outro]
