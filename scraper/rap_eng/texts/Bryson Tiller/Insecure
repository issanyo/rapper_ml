[Verse 1: Jazmine Sullivan]
Gotta' lot on my mind
I'm thinking I'm needing a break to clear up the clutter, damn man
Can I get a minute get some space, man
You been through my head, playing games man
You be way too controlling
Got me feeling like I can't breathe, I can't even hang with a homie
Ain't no reason not to trust me, I'm your lady not a slave
You my nigga not my master, I'll escape thinking who can I run to?
Got me looking for a new dude
With a chill vibe, who a nice time, who can lay back, who don't pick fights, who ain't insecure

[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan]
Why you gotta' be so insecure?
When I did all I could do, but you be wanting more
And why you can't get up off my back
And I can take a lot of shit, but I won't take that

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Been a long time, ain't been home - I been away
Work got me in and out of state
Don't know what you're doing, wonder what you're doing
You got niggas in your face, I'll never let you go to waste
You're my treasure, baby, not my trash
Thirsty bout to make a nigga spaz
Why I treat you like a trophy, control freak
I tell you that's better than no freak
Find someone better you can go free
Stop trippin' girl you know me, I'm your homie
Don't cut it off, we done said it all and we done it all
I want it all, for myself sorry if I'm coming off insecure
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan]
Why you gotta be so insecure?
When I did all I could do, but you be wanting more
And why you can't get up off my back
And I can take a lot of shit, but I won't take that

[Verse 3: Jazmine Sullivan]
Don't you never trust, it's important
Ever heard of that, is it foreign to you?
Is a good time really boring to you?
You be on your Suge Knight, always trying to fight
You're a bully or a lover
Are you my man or my big brother
Baby somethings wrong with this picture
You make it hard to wanna stay with ya
I'm your lady, not a slave
You my nigga, not my master, I'll escape
Thinking who can I run to?
Got me looking for a new dude
I'm a good girl but you reachin'
'bout to make me give you reason to be insecure

[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan]
Why you gotta' be so insecure? (so insecure)
When I did all I could do, but you be wanting more (but you be wanting more and more)
And why you can't get above my back
And I can take a lot of shit, but I won't take that (but I won't take that)
No I won't take that no more
