DJ Edubb

[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller]
I don’t care about no woman baby, I don’t mean no harm
Have been told that men are dogs and so I try not to be one
I don't really give a fuck about no bitch and what she wants
Girl excuse my rude behavior, no time for you
You're playin’ with the wrong one, huh
You got the wrong one, huh
Check that inbox on your phone hon
Leave me alone hun
I don't want ya
Don't give a fuck whatcha' momma thinks
I’m a young nigga tryna do my thing
All you haters hop off my shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
Cuz I don't want ya, nah - yea
Fuck this I’m gone hun, nuh

[interlude]
I am, I am
You know what I like
Oh yea, oh yea
Oh yea, oh yea
Oh yea, oh yea

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
You're in no position, don't need your permission
To go do what I want, even if I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, there is no commitment
So I do what I want even if I go fuck these bitches
They might, they might catch some feelings
Ask me if i give it
Girl I just begun and I don't mix pleasure with business
I don't, I don't love these bitches, cuz all these hoes be trippin’
I don't need to get away

[Interlude: Bryson Tiller]
Oh Whoa, trust issues
Oh Whoa, trust issues
Oh Whoa, trust issues
Oh Whoa, trust issues
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Bryson Tiller]
Yea, Uh
Tiller man, hear me out
Every song another bitch get singled out
Won't say no names, but I really should
She didn't never hesitate to put her business out
Lame niggas, they be acting like they your friends
But I know they only want get under your clothes
Tell me why the fuck you ever let this nigga in
When you knew that he was only fucking woman over
Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell
You don't even wear your white wings no more
Tell my niggas I don't like weed no more
But fuck it I'ma blow till I don't see no more
You can look at me and tell that I just ain't myself
And if I let all y'all change me, then I hate myself i'm real
Tell them girls grin, they ain't gotta worry 'bout a thang all my people getting in
I'm ok with if my ex in the crew but if she steppin' with a dude imma be angry with him when I see him I

[Verse 4: Bryson Tiller & DJ Edubb]
DJ Edubb
Here's the shit that drives me crazy, oh
When it comes to love, I'm kinda lazy
Why I never put the time in
I don't never feel the need to put the pressure on them
Ignore all my haters, cuz they love it when I mind them
They do, they do
Lets get wasted
Call up mah niggas, let's all get faded

[Outro: Bryson Tiller]
I mean like, I'm just saying like
I just can't trust a hoe man, like for real, like
These bitches they be tryna talk to me, man
On that Facebook and shit, they got "I'm in love with my hubby"
But you still tryna talk to me doe
Psshh, damn shame, what the fuck man, you bitches crazy
Do anything for a lil bit of fame
Just to get a lil bit of hype on your name
What the fuck man, you hoes is crazy, I swear you hoes are crazy
I don't know what to do, man, you hoes are crazy
I don't know what the fuck to do, man, I'm lazy, I'm fucking lazy
When it comes to love man, you, you, you, you
All ya'll bitches
Fuck with a nigga though
