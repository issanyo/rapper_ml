Baby, You should try loving again
I know how you feel, trust me, I been there

I been hit by love again
This time I think I’m down for good, oooh but I love her
And I would gladly change my heart only for her

Yeahhh yeahh yes I would, You can’t give up on love aye
Cause there’s somebody out there who depends on You

And it might be me darling, don’t beat yourself up
It’s not You it’s them oooh, you deserve much more, but first youuuu

You should try to invite loving again, oh I run from love again
She’s like a sculpture dropped too many times
Stayed up the night and she cried
She’s been hit by love again

See now we can go to war, I guess we staying to fight
Living monopolized in this chess game of life
Keeping you occupied while we steady rolling the dice
Long as you recognize that we ain’t even promised tonight aight
Say we can make love as my record plays, You are my strange fruit billy holiday
Even if our light was over right after today, be my vampire just so you never pass away
It’s time for me as your man to take on a new challenge
Yo my foot might skip but I never lose balance
She made a special drink and then mixed it with lemon
Took a dip of her love and now I’m over the limit
The worlds gone cold, time for emotional healing
See we can run from love but can’t get away from the feeling
Claim you see through me but I ain’t even made a glass
I built a time machine so we could eliminate the past

You should try to invite loving again, oh I run from love again
She’s like a sculpture dropped too many times
Stayed up the night and she cried
She’s been hit by love again

Ooooo, you’ve been hit, you’ve been hit

You’ve been, you’ve been, you’ve been hit by love, oooo
