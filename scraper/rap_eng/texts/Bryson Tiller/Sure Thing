[Intro: Bryson Tiller & J Shipp]
Take me to the back that'll be your best bet
For real, take me to the back that'll be your best bet
You can bet that never gotta sweat that

[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller]
Oh I can't lie babe, yeah yeah you fine
I know you flattered cause I tell you all the time
You look so good
I ain't gotta tell them that you're mine cause they know it
Girl your shit's bomb you know I don't wanna blow it
Can't nobody come in-between us
Fuck everybody that be tryna get involved (them haters)
I don't care if they don't wanna see us
Now I don't give a damn, tell 'em close they eyes

[Hook: Bryson Tiller & J Shipp]
Even when you're single you're still mine babe
I don't care what anybody says
So tell them other nigga's step aside
Just tell your friends you're my ride or die
I won't let nobody in the way baby
You can have what's in my chest
Imma tell you baby simple and plain
This love is a sure thing
(You can bet that never gotta sweat that) 4x

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
You gotta face like Maya but an ass like Trina
Drippin' while she got that aquafina nigga oowee
Girl they only jealous when they callin' you a groupie
But I bet them hoes feel the same if they knew me
When they ask me
Girl I'm ashamed to tell them that you ain't my girl for real
Take my last name

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]
Even when you're single you're still mine babe
I don't care what anybody says
So tell them other nigga's step aside
Just tell your friends you're my ride or die
I won't let nobody in the way baby
You can have whats in my chest
Imma tell you baby simple and plain
This love is a sure thing

[Verse 3: Bryson Tiller & J Shipp]
You can bet that never gotta sweat that
Babygirl is a dime and that's a true fact
And this a sure thing
She the most beautiful woman I have ever seen
The most precious being that walked God's earth
And never downgrade herself, she know her true worth
And her worth is more than the worlds most precious pearls
I gotta pinch myself I'm seeing the dream girl
But in the meantime, I gotta thank God
For every second he put into making you cause
You my number 1
And I'm glad that you made me the only one
Shine hotter than the sun
When you hotter than hell
But you sweeter than heaven
So only time can tell
And only lord knows the reason that you're mine
And this a sure thing that you brought my dream to life
(yeah yeah)

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]
Even when you're single you're still mine babe
I don't care what anybody says
So tell them other nigga's step aside
Just tell your friends you're my ride or die
I won't let nobody in the way baby
You can have what's in my chest
Imma tell you baby simple and plain
This love is a sure thing
