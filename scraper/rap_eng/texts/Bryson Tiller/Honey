[Intro]
Nah...
Fuck it... check me out

[Verse 1]
I hit your phone like, "What's up?
When you tryin' get this sex from me?
You know I don't mean no disrespect, honey, ayy"
Ain't no gas, you the best, honey
Fine ass, send a pic, had to get a text from me
Lovin' how that gold sit on your neck, honey
That gold chain that's on your neck
I love the way you dress, got a nigga so impressed
Come out to the west, you say that's a bet (bet)
Wish I had a jet, get you here faster
Been on one before, must be fuckin' with a rapper
I knew you was with it when you drove out to Atlanta
I knew you was different when you spoke to me, your grammar
So eloquent and mannered, yeah that shit attractive
And you nasty, told me come break your back in (back in)
What's poppin' later? We got action
No distraction, know a place that we could crash in

[Chorus]
Baby girl, ayy
I know a place where
Know a place that we could crash in
A place where we could get there
I know a place, oh
What you askin'?
Honey what you askin'?
Baby tell me what you askin' for
Back and forth
She want that sticky slow like molasses
Slow, girl, slow, girl
Anything you want, you can have it
Honey, you a bad bitch

[Verse 2]
They don't know what I know
They don't see what I see
You know bitches gon' hate on you constantly
Say the things you bought you prolly got from me
That's nonsense, we don't listen to nonsense
Get it on her own, no she don't need a sponsor
Yeah mama, get your bread, mama
Look so innocent but she a head monster
She could get whoever, swear I gotta lay it proper
But you can still call me Young Papa
Take trips with me, nothing's what it's gon' cost ya
Next time we hit New York we need a loft, yeah
Damn that ass so soft
Handful of your hair, I pull it when I break you off
Get it, get it however you want, yup (want, yeah)
Look at you, baby you dolled up
Don't be modest, you get all this
Tell me what you askin'

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
I know a place where
Know a place that we could crash in
A place where we could get there
I know a place, oh
What you askin'?
Honey what you askin'?
Baby tell me what you askin' for
Back and forth
She want that sticky slow like molasses
Slow, girl, slow, girl
Anything you want, you can have it
Honey, you a bad bitch

[Outro]
Bad bitch
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
