[Verse]
I don’t need nobody else around see
Love the way you compliment my style
You ain't gotta go you could stay for a while
Know you got a thing or two to say to me now
Te- telling me the things that I did
You’re forgetting things that you did
Told you ‘bout them other bitches that I fooled with
You still tryna act like you ain’t ever do shit
