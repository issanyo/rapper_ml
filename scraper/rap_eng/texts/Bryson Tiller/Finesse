[Intro]
Yeah, wow
They not ready for my new shit
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York? I can't decide
Fashion week was more your thing than mine
I can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside
I can't do suit and tie
Can't be in one room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high
I wish you felt alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Just hitting my line
All the time, all the time, all oooo–
You stay on my mind
All the time, all the time (oooo)

[Chorus]
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind

[Verse 2]
You and your sister
Too hot to handle
Things would get cancelled
I would make time for you
Commitment
Going the distance
I'm new to all of this

[Chorus]
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind

[Outro]
You stay on my mind (stay)
Stay on my mind
Baby you stay on
Baby you stay on
Baby you stay on
You stay on
Baby you stay
On my mind, stay on my mind
On my mind, stay on my mind
You st–
On my mind, stay on my mind
