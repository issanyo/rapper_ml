[Verse 1: Aluna Francis]
No love and no graces, I'm not gonna lie
I just want your body covering bases
You want the same thing
No feelings, nothing lost there at all
We're just here to answer the call
We're not in a movie, that's not what we do
There's nothing to lose, we're not tryna prove things
That's not how we do this
If you wanna tell me that I'm the one
Just say it with the tip of your tongue

[Pre-Chorus: Aluna Francis]
I'm not saying that we're out of hope forever, oh, oh
I'm not saying that we're never gonna find love
But tonight

[Chorus: Aluna Francis]
Don't act like we're not cold blooded creatures
Can't teach us to act right
Don't speak like we got more nights in store
I'm not yours and you're not mine
Why can't we show our worst side
Get freaky, get nasty and kill time?
Don't act like what we do is beneath us
Don't act like we're not cold blooded creatures

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Yeah, you bring me down
Is there anymore you want to place on me now?
Weigh me down (Yeah)
If you want to say that Iâ€™m the one
Just say it with the tip of your tongue

[Pre-Chorus: Bryson Tiller, Aluna Francis & Bryson Tiller]
I'm not saying that we're out of hope forever, oh, oh, oh (Hey, ooh, no)
I'm not saying that we're never gonna find love
But tonight

[Chorus: Aluna Francis, Aluna Francis & Bryson Tiller]
Don't act like we're not cold blooded creatures
Can't teach us to act right
Don't speak like we got more nights in store
I'm not yours and you're not mine
Why can't we show our worst side
Get freaky, get nasty and kill time?
Don't act like what we do is beneath us
Don't act like we're not cold blooded creatures

[Bridge: Aluna Francis & Bryson Tiller]
Let's stop with the nice and quietly fight
And we'll meet again if our stars are aligned
But tonight

[Chorus: Aluna Francis, Aluna Francis & Bryson Tiller]
Don't act like we're not cold blooded creatures
Can't teach us to act right
Don't speak like we got more nights in store
I'm not yours and you're not mine
Why can't we show our worst side
Get freaky, get nasty and kill time?
Don't act like what do is beneath us
Don't act like we're not cold blooded creatures
