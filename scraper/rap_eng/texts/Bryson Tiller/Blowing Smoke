Young Pen Griffey
I go to, I go to bat for my niggas
The pun was intended, nigga
Wow, look how I'm livin', nigga
Angels say watch how you spendin', nigga
Devil say cop a new Bentley, nigga
Might as well, quick as you get it, nigga
Made a prediction, nigga
Fortune teller, nigga
Ayy, I got it, yeah, I get it, nigga
You a rappin' contradiction, nigga
Hunnid racks on a sticker
New whip and I'm in it with her
Set it off, this a stick up
'Tiller came to shake shit up
Shakin' that shit up
Then I go put another check in the bank, nigga
Got a lot up on my plate, nigga
Grandma need a new estate, nigga
You a fraud, you a fake, nigga
Can't keep up with the pace, nigga
Get the fuck up out the race, nigga

[Chorus]
Yeah, pump your brakes, go slow
Pump your brakes, go slow
Just like my shawty, she like it slow
Yeah, and just like her, I heard it all before
Don't let 'em fool you, they blowing smoke
Yeah, they blowing smoke, yeah
Yeah, I heard it all before
Don't let 'em lie to you anymore
Hey, don't let 'em lie to you anymore

[Verse 2]
Ayy, don't let 'em fool you, baby
Gene Snyder, gear shift a nigga
Need a lighter for the spliff, nigga
I pull up in; a street fighter chain, hit a nigga
Now that I got your attention, nigga
Keep my name off your lips, nigga
Hey, just like her, I don't take you serious, nigga
No you can't be serious, nigga
You can't be serious, nigga
I can't even hear it, nigga
Gotta be up on my tier, nigga
You ain't nowhere near, nigga
Young Tiller don't fear a nigga
Ayy, this no joke, no smoke, no mirrors, nigga
Know you seen me last year, nigga
All at Cleveland Cavaliers, nigga
Thoroughbred, I'm a winner
D'USSE in my cup, I feel like Jigga
Wins got me hittin' liquor (faded)
And they got you niggas feelin' bitter (you mad)
Bitch, I been a heavy hitter
But you barely makin' plays, nigga
Fuck it, let me demonstrate, nigga
Home runnin', now I'm safe, nigga
Guess I got what it takes, nigga
Can't keep up with the pace, nigga
Get the fuck up out the race, nigga

[Chorus]
Yeah, pump your brakes, go slow
Pump your brakes, go slow
Just like my shawty, she like it slow
Yeah, and just like her, I heard it all before
Don't let 'em fool you, they blowing smoke
Yeah, they blowing smoke, yeah
Yeah, I heard it all before
Don't let 'em lie to you anymore
Hey, don't let 'em lie to you anymore
