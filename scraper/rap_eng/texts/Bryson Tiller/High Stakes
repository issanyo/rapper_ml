[Intro]
Hey, yeah
Haha, I hate to put a time stamp on this, but
It's my birthday
And I'm feeling great
I feel great
Yeah, fuck it, I'm feeling great
24 today, by the way
Okay

[Verse 1]
Came a long way
(Yeah, I came a long way)
Ayy, I looked up and said "God damn, I came a long way"
In the VIP, this shit feel like a showcase
Take me to a place I'd rather be, there's no place
I got a pocket full of cash, it's more than I made last year when I was packing
Oh, wait, it been 2 years, I lost track and
No way I'm going back, I been in mansions
I been in whips so quick that you lose traction
And made 6-figure transactions
Met a lot of pretty women AKA distractions
And some fuck niggas with subliminal captions
I won't (I won't)
Show these lames no compassion
Wanna play the game, gotta have expansion
Nes sent me an e-mail, came with attachments
And like a fan of the show, nigga, I started snapping

[Chorus]
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's happening, oh, what's happening?
Woah, woah, high stakes got me feeling like I'm gambling (I can ball but lose it all)
Drink got a nigga rambling (like I'm talking to myself)
But hear me out

[Verse 2]
I wake up and see a roof over my head
Used to be the roof of a '04 Audi, that shit used to be my bed
Lot of disrespect from those who used to be my friends
Lot of checks to replace those used to be friends
I don't fuck with you, what don't you comprehend?
Give a fuck who I offend, real and fake cannot blend
And I pray to God I never lose a cake, amen (Amen)
With the high stakes, I'm in
I'm in
Even with niggas after me
I still stroll through the city casually
RIP Static G
Ali gone, that's another tragedy
Oh, my God, who gon' show the kids strategy?
I done seen so many things that they gotta see
I made it to the game using honesty
I know my momma proud of me
God tell her she gave birth to a young prodigy

[Outro]
Aye
Aye
Thank you
To the most high
(High up)
(High up)
Praying that them blessings don't stop
I'm praying that them blessings don't
Yeah
