[Intro: Faith Evans & Bryson Tiller]
Oh, my inspiration comes from you, oh
So you think you got what it takes
To be my ride or die?
Okay
We shall see

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I been out here soul searchin'
Ayy, say you still got it, girl, what makes you so certain?
Hit it, quit it, then went cold turkey
You been committed through this whole journey
Got a girl that don't expect as much from me
That's why she gets so much love from me
She just might be the one for me
Ain't no need to question, down bitch

[Chorus]
She 'a pull the gun for me
Pop 2, she 'a take one for me
Set it off, if a bitch come for me
Set if off, if a nigga come for me
She 'a pull the gun for me
Pop 2, she 'a take one for me
Set it off, if a bitch come for me
Set it off, if a nigga come

[Verse 2]
Do you remember them days, I would cut school and come to you
Ma' was cool so I got comfortable
Sleeping on the couch, sneak up to your room, ayy
I found out you was a freak too soon, ayy
Your family thought we had baby too soon, phh
I told your family not to speak too soon, ayy
Three years later, I'm on TV
Now your brother, he envy me
I don't know what the fuck he be on, ayy
Cool with me cool, we was never friends
He put your mama under stress, I put her in a Benz
Even though she put me in the streets, she made amends
Watchin' over my babies nigga
'Case her son wanna go back to his ways and be a street nigga
Plus my girl just copped the heat, nigga
And she gon' kill almost any nigga
Including me, nigga
Ain't nobody who could be with her, 'cept for me
That's my down bitch

[Chorus]
She 'a pull the gun for me
Pop two, she 'a take one for me
Set it off, if a bitch come for me
Set it off, if a nigga come for me
She 'a pull the gun for me
Pop two, she 'a take one for me
Set it off, if a bitch come for me
Set it off, if a nigga come for me

[Outro: Bryson Tiller & Unknown]
Ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ayy, think she'll fuck with this song?
Yeah, I hope so nigga
She ain't call me back for some reason
Oh well, I love her
