[Verse]
The new nigga, where the fuck did he come from?
I got all these niggas shocked, stun gun
And that will never be a nigga I run from
Pussy speed dial 9-1-1
I walk around with my chin up
Fresh and cold its winter
Neck fill with more juice than a fucking bar mitzvah
That's what I deserve, I be riding round in that hertz
Cause a nigga tryin' to kill me I will fuck around and whack him first
And that's when she dissed me and I saw your girlfriend me
She know I ain't done she but that bitch still trying to quench me
I'm hungry I eat his beef, that's just my killer instinct
Bars on bars on bars i lock you niggas up i got it easy
This nigga he mad at, this nigga I swear
All the niggas that's faggots, the jewelry they be wearin' huh
Good start the whip, now I'm ridin' in the caucus
Fresh hat above my head, now I'm thinking are these
I'm rollin' with some Barby hoes
They let me whip cardio
I drive these bitches crazy tho, till I fuck the hoe
She Spiderman, she said she don't want me to fire in
She told you that she only like girls, nigga try again
Exception for to night she gonna pop it for the new dew
Kicks, smash,my polo, I had to cop him boo hoo
Tell the hoes when they on me, their legs gonna be choo choo
I'm crazy cookoo, but maybe I'm like "cookoo"
New rooms, my game, never changes
My hoes be light skin, my phone book "yellow pages"
That was crazy, she black and white immigration
She goes to South America she gonna rock in Venezuela
I'm new, I'm sick, my crib should be an incubator
My flow gonna incinerate ya, make you box incinerate ya
I'm in the building, in the 'vator
I will not befriend a hater
Fuck the world, in a trader
Life's a bitch, insinuate ya
All you niggas jealous, they still running on the track, but
In person you out of breath, like you just did a hundred laps nigga
Nigga, I can do a hundred reps in one night bitch I miss it cause
Slidin' down your chimney, and i go get your love
I wouldn't get involved cause that could be your last hoe
If these whack niggas don't leave I got my Lysol
Niggas don't need to ask ya know so
These niggas make it rain over and over, snow globe
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, hold up
At least I kill these poachers. I don't give a damn
Can't nobody broke my vault up
Put your head in a briefcase and my your business shit
My momma told you to mind your damn motherfuckin' business, Bitch, tomorrow when I wanna see your drank
I think I'm gonna finish it
Tonight when we sexting, you gonna think I invented it
Bitch, I'm making bangers for the industry
Tell somebody fuck with me
Tell somebody ain't nobody can fuck with me
I'm too cold
