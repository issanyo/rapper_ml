[Intro]
Roll up through yo hood, yeah
Bring some friends you cool with
Then I want you to strip

[Verse 1]
Hol', hol', hol' up
Freeze
Watch that boy come in with ease
You would not believe
I come in yo dream
Make you cum in yo jeans
Shawty so fresh she don't need Summer's Eve
Lose the joker and summon the king
Better hope I don't come in between
Dope dick will turn you to a fiend
Girl you better be careful
Yeah
If she don't take my advice
I just might
Pull the plug
Straight up why you acting like you so scared of him
I'm coming live from the south side
You ain't his no mo, 'bout time
Talk the talk but I'm 'bout mine

[Pre-Hook]
Got a lotta class
Whole lotta ass
I don't care if y'all hoes get mad
Just don't get in the way everyday
Girl you know I gotta brag
My bitch in tip top shape
I like how her lip gloss taste
Stop playing, get rid of ole boy
Cause when Tiller deploy, girl that nigga dead weight

[Chorus]
I ain't yo man that's true enough
I'll fill that void girl true enough
I ain't hearing that boy ain't mature enough (he ain't on my level)
I just wanna set you free don't wanna handcuff
I ain't yo man that's true enough
I'll fill that void girl true enough
I ain't hearing that boy ain't mature enough (he ain't on my level)
I just wanna set you free don't wanna handcuff (release you)

[Verse 2]
You always on my mind (always on my mind)
True talk girl I ain't lyin'
I'm tryna make you mine
Let me set you free and watch you fly
Mama what's up
I'm breaking bread with my commas it's up
If I pay these hoes mind won't get bang for my buck
Banking on yo side bitch
You'll go bankrupt
I can't be touched
And y'all fuck niggas just can't keep up
Taking my time this shit can't be rushed
I'm always confusing
Love with lust
Forgetting bitches just can't be trusted

[Pre-Hook]
And got a lotta ass (lotta ass)
Whole lotta ass
Look good than a mothafucker
Oh my god you know I gotta brag
My bitch in tip top shape
I like how her lip gloss taste
Stop playing, get rid of ole boy
Cause when Tiller deploy, girl that nigga dead weight

[Chorus]
I ain't yo man that's true enough
I'll fill that void girl true enough
I ain't hearing that boy ain't mature enough (he ain't on my level)
I just wanna set you free don't wanna handcuff
I ain't yo man that's true enough
I'll fill that void girl true enough
I ain't hearing that boy ain't mature enough (hey, hey, hey)
I just wanna set you free don't wanna handcuff

[Outro]
Oh yea
I wanna lay you down
Lay you down
Lay you down
