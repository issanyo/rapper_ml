[Intro]
Ayy
It's a recap and
Ayy, yeah, tragic
Whoa-oh
Hol' up

[Verse 1]
Oh no no, I see you callin' my phone
Must be that time to talk about what I've puttin' off for so long
Think I gotta part ways with you
Took my own advice, girl I ain't gon' play with you
Know you thought this shit was for eternity
Put a stop to it when it’s hurtin’ me
Can we talk about it? Girl, certainly
Oh, you got words for me
I’ve been tryna keep my life burden-free
Hit me after 9, that’s the only time that works for me
Came through looking all good, you do that purposely
You-you-you wanna make this worse for me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You know you ain’t gon’ get curved up in here
Got ya boy about to surf up in here
Girl, I know it’s waterworks up in here
All you did was turn up this year
Was there anything you learned from this year?
Thought I wouldn’t notice
Baby know, I’ve been observing this year, oh whoa

[Chorus]
I'll be looking for the new you, next year
That’s what’s up, you better do you, next year
Don’t say it just, don’t say it just, girl don’t say it just
Prove it next year
Baby, that’s how I'ma do big next year
(That's how I'ma do big next year)
Don't fuck around and lose me next year
(Lose me next year, ooh no-oh)

[Verse 2]
I got a car, a J-O-B
I’m a independent man, God is blessing me
(Blessing me, oh yeah yeah)
A lotta girls that I can call
Nine times outta ten, nine times outta ten
I don't call 'em at all (Call 'em at all)
Hey, what you doin' up in Hollywood Hills?
Now you know how Hollywood feels
All these poppin' niggas know they out there politicin'
House party, it's a lotta drugs, lotta women
Lotta women, look at they faces, they optimistic
I can't believe you got caught up in it
I can't believe you got caught up in it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh yeah
You don't gotta stay around here (Yeah)
I ain't too far away from 'round here (Yeah)
But I can't save you when I'm not here (Yeah)
I've been working, girl I'm out here (Yeah)
I don't spend a lot of time here (Yeah)
Say you making change, this talk is cheap
I need to see what I hear, show me all year
Hey, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be looking for the new you, next year
That’s what’s up, you better do you, next year
Don’t say it just, don’t say it just, girl don’t say it just
Prove it next year
Baby, that’s how I'ma do big next year
(Baby, that's how I'ma do big next year)
Don't fuck around and lose me next year, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah yeah, don't fuck around and lose me)

[Outro]
Oh, I can't do it no more
Yeah, you gon' have to show
You gon' have to show
Show me you deserve my time
Hol' up
