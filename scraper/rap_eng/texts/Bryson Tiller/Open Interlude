[Intro]
Now's the time to just clear the air
Put this shit back in motion
Put this shit back in motion
Now you finally open, I'm just tryna be only
We been ashin' our roaches
Throw them shits in a bowl and (smoke that shit up)
Roll one mo' and we fired up
Now we both lookin' high as fuck
I been waitin', but time's up
You ain't look me in the eye once
Fuck it out you if I must
You ain't gotta be shy girl if...
Hol' up

[Verse]
You don't know how much
You helped me grow, you've helped me grow, baby, yeah
You don't know how much I've been tryna show you
I know you felt me though
Ooh, girl I saw this comin'
Don't wanna act all nonchalant, that would mean
That everything we talked about was all for nothin'
Ohh, girl you know I've been sufferin'
Mmm, hmmm, mmm
Mmm, hmmm, mmm
Baby I've been sufferin'
Does that mean nothin'?
Itâ€™s gotta mean somethin'
Baby I would go insane for your love
Fuck what your friends say, girl that's gotta mean somethin'
This became a little bit too much
Gotta watch my intake, that's gotta mean somethin'
This how it goin', put that shit back in motion
Gotta mean somethin'
Now I got your ass hoping
Promise everything gon' be kosher
