[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
When, when I look you in your face, I see
A good girl who deserves better than me (Better than me, yeah)
You remember that other night in my bedroom?
On top of my bed
I remember the things that you said

[Chorus]
Sometimes I forget
Sometimes you gotta put me in check, aye
In check, yeah
In check, yeah
In check, yeah
In check, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hollywood, set back
3 hours, I'm jet-lagged
Still tryna lay up with somethin'
Can't believe I just said that
Album, overdue
You would find it hard to focus too
If you met the women I have
Hard not to get side-tracked, oh woah, hey
Don't know where my mind at
Hoping you can help find that
I wish I could rewind back
I love you
Way back so you could put me
Put me in check, yeah
In check, yeah
What did I do to you?
Made a fool of you
I know they told you I'd never be true to you
I'm losing you
Losing you
I miss you in my bedroom
On top of my bed
How could I forget what you said?

[Chorus]
Sometimes I forget
And sometimes you gotta put me in check, aye
In check, yeah
In check, yeah
In check, yeah
In check, yeah

[Outro]
Baby, no
Baby, no, no
