[Verse 1]
I wanna know how we became so distant girl
The way we fell in love it was almost instant
I'm tryna find a way around it
Girl tell me how you feel about it
You still love me, that's the way it's sounding
Thank God I would have never found this, I doubt it
I'm there for you if you allow it
Girl you know I gotta keep you around me
All this paper we counting, blazing these ounces
Spending on you baby no matter what the amount is
Now you wanna know what's gotten into me, what's changed?
I guess I had a hard time showing it at first but

[Hook]
Baby it's been that way
Baby it's been that way
Baby I still feel the same
Something I gotta maintain
Listen to me when I say
Baby it's always, always, always been that way
It's always been that way
(Didn't I tell you girl?)
It's always been that way
Baby I still feel the same
Something I gotta maintain
Listen to me when I say
It's always been that way

[Verse 2]
How did we become so distant?
Like I'm the one to blame and you're innocent
I try to make a way, make a difference, but
Some things don't change, I can't complain
I try not to think about you
What can I say, everytime I get near you
I want that old thing back, now bring it to me
Shorty keep telling me what to do about you
Then she got jealous soon as she knew about you
She don't never wanna see her go through round two
(Cut her off!) Cut her off that's what I'm doing now, you
Told me I should go out and do my thing
(Damn right!) Damn right I do my thing
Now you want to know what's gotten into me, what's changed?
But baby none change

[Hook]
Baby it's been that way
Baby it's been that way
Baby I still feel the same
Something I gotta maintain
Listen to me when I say
Baby it's always, always, always been that way
It's always been that way
(Didn't I tell you girl?)
It's always been that way
Baby I still feel the same
Something I gotta maintain
Listen to me when I say
It's always been that way
It's always been that way
It's always been that way

[Outro]
We the trap in the soul
We the trap
