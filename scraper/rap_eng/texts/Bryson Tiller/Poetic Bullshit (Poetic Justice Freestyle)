[Intro]
Just give me a minute
Man I swear that imma hit it
Said if she a bad bitch
Gotta catch her eye, Dance so fine
Thick ass, thick thighs
Drop a niggas pipe down right now
Lets get in this room
I’m talking about me and you
Ha!

[Verse 1]
I never thought I’d taste it
But goddamn thats sweeter than a pastry uh
Lookin at me like chase this
Leading me down to your basement uh
Dodge niggas like matrix
I’m laid up with you in the bed naked
Singing go ‘head and bust it go ‘head and bust it
If I told you I was thinking about four and plus one
Would you wanna discuss it?
Im talking about, jeans on, man a three some
Whatever kinda mood you in
Im exploring your grove bouta swim to the surface
And dive back in
Get you wetter again and again
I really wanna stroke it off
I really wanna go in raw, Fuck that
Love it how you wear my chain
Ride me while your head just swangin'
You just picture perfect
And I wanna beat little out that frame
I murk that
She wanna go get started, she wanna go get started
She gets impatient we gone and get naughty
Well goddamn she don’t see no shaman
I’d been contemplating how to break you off
Until I get that stand with you one night
Till then I’m just standing still
P.S

[Hook]
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it
Oh and I know this know, this know, this what you want
Poetic Justice put it in a song

[Verse 2]

But he can see by them faces
That you making that you faking
She said fuck me like you hate me
Fuck me like its fuck me
So I beat it like I don’t need it like
I’m so heated like man, Fuck it
Talented she 180 while she on top of me
She know bitches thirsty so she gon catch every drop of me
I swerve on her
A well I should be anyway
I could be
I’m sure they wish I would be
Drop a couple words on her
She understood me
Then I tell her turnover
Nigga thats that good D!
This dick make her run
Same dick make her cum
Got feelings for that nigga
Baby I can make you numb
And I know you in a relationship
So thats why I won’t tell
But I could never write my wrongs
Shit if I write them down it’s still B.S
