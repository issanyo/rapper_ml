[Intro]
Yeah, B. Tiller, man
Yes sir, yes sir
Get the weed out

[Chorus]
Your love is a 187 (yeah)
Taking me to heaven
It's killing me, no love should be this good

[Verse 1]
OK, first of all, you a badass bitch
Hard for me to walk past that shit
Your ass, all them niggas still @ that shit
I'll pass shawty, come and let me grab that shit
I feel like me and you could really do some things
With your eyesight, you could probably do the same
Yeah, just so tired of the usual baes
How 'bout later on the night? I could use some brain
Did you catch that?
Sending back shots all through your spine, girl, I commit the crime
Sentence me the time, girl, you checking me to find
I just hope you never lie about the fact like [?]
Girl, I keep it a hundred percent real
Put it down whenever we be fucking up in here
Don't worry, shawty, I'mma have you coming in here
Drive by, mama, I'mma get the bussing in here, yeah
Take me up, then take me to Heaven, yep
Bryson Tiller, shawty, I'mma have you yelling that
Hit it from the back, that ass hella fat
Got them niggas like "damn, what the hell is that?"
We be having fun in this bed
I might fuck around and use my tongue in this bed
People crunching up, tryna run in this bed
Think I might end up using my gun instead
This shit is hella bomb, explosive
And I better make that come with that motion
Girl respect that, never got to sweat that
I'm just being myself like I'm supposed to

[Chorus]
Your love is a 187
Taking me to heaven
It's killing me, no love should be this good
(Tell me what's good, girl, I get it in)
Your love is a 187
Taking me to heaven
It's killing me, no love should be this good
(Fuck it, I'mma sing, sing this shit, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you fucking with a real ass nigga
I know a hundred real bitches that could vouch for me
Sit back, laid up on that couch for me
Cause I just bought an ounce of weed
I rarely smoke but I've gotta get high for this
Kissing all over your thighs and shit
Roll your eyes back, unbutton your shirt
Say you gon' fuck me, but it's more like the opposite
Babe, twerk that, I work that
You want that, girl come here, babe
If I ever catch you come around my block
I'mma take you to my spot, oh god, I'mma bust that
Most girls ain't like you, hardcore
They want it rough, and I'm sure
(And my killer instinct's got her body choked out, laying on my floor)
Nah, nah, she don't call it quits when I'm part of it
She know I fuck her good right after the arguments
And she ride slow, titties all in my face
God damn, you know what I got my eyes on
Dem chicks, she be pulling in the vid
Just kill all them other hoes, bullet to the head
Sex tape blood, mami put it in the red
Don't answer the phone, girl, it could've been the feds (oh yeah)
Your love is a 187
24/7, damn you fine
I can't even run no clique, claim you mine
Cuffing on your ass with my hands, oh god
You thicker than a snicker
It'll be a shame if I wanna hit-quit you
I can never lose your love
(Shawty, we can do it anywhere you like)

[Chorus]
Cause your love is a 187
Taking me to heaven
It's killing me, no love should be this good
Your love is a 187
Taking me to heaven
It's killing me, no love should be this good

[Outro]
Lil mama, I'm telling you that I rarely smoke
I don't get drunk, just barely though
She take a hit and get loose than a motherfucker
Spin on my dick like a merry-go
She fucking me like I'm rich or something
Tell her gon' suck a nigga dick or something
She on whatever, told me she gon' let me foster the pussy
That mean I could bone forever
That's funny cause I had a couple things in mind
I eat it right shawty, but you came this time
Told me I can do whatever, I'm like hell yeah
On your knees, shawty, I'mma make it rain this time
We take a break and we smoke it up
Grab another bottle, let's pour it up
Let's pour it up
Now let's roll a blunt
