[Intro]
Ayy, yeah

[Verse]
I'm not your, your man, baby
No, I can't do what a man should be doing for you
Trying my best to pull through for you, yeah, yeah
Listen, few years we been at it, so much static
I been calling you sporadically
Same old shit, pack your bags, come lay back with me, ayy
Last time that we fucked, that shit was cinematic
I don't expect for you to settle for me
But I hate it when you say to me
"You're done playing games with me
Done tryna wait for me, still check for me
You can't get away from me, yeah, yeah
Go tell them you still love me, yeah
Don't know it but you're stuck with me, yeah
By now you know you're stuck with me, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah"
You say I'm talking like I don't wanna wife
I just wanna fuck, you damn right
Treat you like a queen and like that's just for me, you damn right
Girl, you damn right, yeah, right
Pull up, at the party with the juice
Looked at me like, "Damn boy, you brought everything but the truth"
Girl, you used to be cool, that's why I started fucking with you
Baby, it feel like the real thing, we used to love without no rules
True, tell me when did you get so confused?
Who told you I belong to you?
I can only be alone with you
Never on the road with you
Fuck you like you're mine, that's what I'm supposed to do
Yeah, just like you're mine
You encourage me to do what's right, do what's right
Yeah, you say that shit and turn around
Hit my line, say, "Come by," fuck on you one more time
We both know this ain't one more time
We both know, ayy
I try to play it off like I'll be fine but I won't, I won't, I won't

[Outro]
Oh girl, oh baby, baby
True
