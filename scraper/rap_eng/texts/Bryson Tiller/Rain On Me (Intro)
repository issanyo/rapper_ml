[Intro]
(Just rain on me, full as a dam at...)
I'm sorry I didn't answer (whoo)
I didn't answer 'cause I was busy, what else
That's why I didn't answer
How about I just call you next time?
Why is it that when I don't answer
You think I'm with somebody else or something?
I don't know

[Verse]
Can't get through, I can't get through
Got me chasing you, I'm chasing you
Got something I want to say to you
I'm done playing games with you
I'm afraid I already lost you
In my car and I'm on my way to you
Is that okay with you?
I wanna grow grey with you
Have a little baby with you
And just cater to you
Just rain on me, I'll rain on you
I'll tell you the lies now, yeah
It's okay to cry now, yeah
Nothing to hide now, yeah
Love on the line now, yeah
Let me make it right now, yeah
Dry your eyes now, yeah, yeah yeah
And I'm hoping we survive now, yeah
I got faith, girl, we'll be fine now, yeah

[Outro]
True, true, true
Oh yeah, yeah
What I tell you at
It ain't that easy, baby
It ain't as easy as you make it seem oh no
Hey, baby
It's okay to cry, just rain on me, yeah
It's okay to cry, just rain on me, yeah
