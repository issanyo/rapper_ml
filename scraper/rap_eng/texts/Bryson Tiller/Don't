[Verse 1]
Don't play with me
Don't be dishonest
Still not understanding this logic
I'm back and i'm better
You push me hard as ever
It's time for me to let up
Cause I can do much better
And baby it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
I'm that somebody whose next up
Had more than enough time to make up
Was easy to see I was fed up
But now i'm on a whole 'nother level
Look he only took your place cause you let him
Fuck it man I guess you didn't know any better
Man I swear you didn't show any effort
But he did everything to show me i'm special
Certain it's his love that holds me together

[Chorus]
He said lately you said he been killing the vibe
Got to be sick of this guy
Pulled up skirt
Hopped in his ride
Left hand was steering the other was gripping my thigh
Nigga go backwards, got high
Better believe me, he's gon' get what you been missing boy
Looking at you like you must must be tripping
Play this song for me said miss him
Don't
Don't

[Verse 2]
Oh, you just kept on playing games
And your love wasn't the same
I don't know what to say but
What a shame
Another nigga had to come and save the day
Clark Kent Superman okay
The only one that got me feeling this way
And that thang so fire baby no propane
Yeah he got that good, he be doing his thang
Im'a keep it 100 man ain't no shame
Way he put it down he deserve everything oh baby
I swear I swear I swear he holds it down
Yeah he holds it now

So don't
