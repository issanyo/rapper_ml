What it look like.. Shorty how you feelin
Ass to the flo', pedicures to ceilin
It's like..  I be the connoisseur of ya feelings
Don't stop till you finished
Omnivore when I'm in it
Now.. Put ya palms on the floor while I'm in it
Legs stand straight don't move don't pivot
I stay in that spot when I'm feelin her shiver
Shots to ya cervix like shots to ya liver
Wow.. Shots of the liquor
She flinch like a shot when I lick her
Feel gold when I'm in her
Call her my kicker
She a champagne sipper I'm a Cognac killer (Wooo !)
Real Coon Life shit
Crack a bottle, Henny sex is a cool night shift
Hol up.. Lemme snooze right quick
Take a nap then I'm back let the booze write this
Brown liquor for a brown nigga
She said its goin up.. Shit & I'm down witchya
The song switch is how the pound differ
She said if you goin down in goin down witchya

So I guess I'm Jack in the Titanic
Instead you extra loyal so you comin down with me
I can dig that..

So you tellin me Tequila got you splitting & lickin sippin & swigging now you lookin for that act right
Slide in have her hidin. Flippin & dippin, pelvis to pelvis now she grippin on my back right
Tape this.. Back cam with the flash light
See waves in her cheeks cuz the ass right
Jason, placement how I stab right
She swear that a Nigga did porn in a past life
Now my thumb on her throat
Thumb in her uhh..
The music is low
We fuck to drum
Then she bit me on my ear & said you fuckin me up
You better hold out Nigga wait cum when I cum
I said fuckk
The way you talk to a brother
No pull out.. & it's ya fault you a mother
Ya kitty good & you talkin that shit
If you think about leavin I'm offin ya shit
Tell them stalkers be cautious ain't auctioning shit
She flawless & gorgeous they all on her hip
A just look at her ass.. Like damn it shake like some Parkinson's shit
It look like a globe with a part in the shit
Just pardon the kid.. Cuz I'm all lit
Hit her with the poker face then I went all in
Nah I poke her face.. Then I went all in
