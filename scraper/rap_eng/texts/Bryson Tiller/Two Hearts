[Verse 1]
You stole my heart bae
If you only knew
How much it breaks my heart
When you say things like "I hate you"
The sound of it almost gave me a heart attack
I bet if I said I would leave you, you wouldn't even care
If you saw me bawlin' tears, I bet you wouldn't even shed one (not one)
Do you even love me like you say I wonder?
Uh huh, damn that's fucked up
Lord please tell me why I love her
Girl I'll beg you for my heart back
Shouldn't have to go through all that

[Hook]
You'll do fine with just one
Why you gotta be so selfish?
Why you gotta be so selfish?
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna get what's mine back
Never mind that
You don't need two hearts
(You stole my heart, give it back to me)

[Verse 2]
So in love, I can't think straight
Please get the fuck out of my head baby
I wanna take a ride, where will I go?
My favorite places we created memories in those
I know you think my heart is fine but it isn't though
Your love, I need it here, physical
Do I gotta beg you for my heart back?
No, I shouldn't have to go through all that

[Hook]
You'll do fine with just one
Why you gotta be so selfish?
Why you gotta be so selfish?
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna get what's mine back
Never mind that
You don't need two hearts
(You stole my heart, give it back to me)

[Verse 3]
Can I rap to you real quick?
I put what's left of my heart into this track
In hoping you'd feel it, damn
Real shit, it took a while to build this
And you still be talking that bullshit
Even though you not around, ventriloquist
You know better, that's off limits
Leave it alone before you break it
Maybe if you knew better, I might let you
But I know you won't hold it safely
Girl, you do know you got my heart
Please tell me what you need two for
To my health, girl, that's crucial
That's why I say I can't lose... you

[Outro]
You're my everything, everything
You've got something that belongs to me, yea
Oh, yeah
Can I have it back?
