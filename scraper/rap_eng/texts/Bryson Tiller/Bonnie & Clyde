[Verse 1]
Pull Up And Hop Out The Whip (skrtt)
You know That I Am The Shit (whoa)
Hop Out Fly Like A Pallas
I'm The Reason Why You Getting Jealous
Cause My Girl Bad To The Bone (To The Bone)
But She Did That On Her Own (On Her Own)
She Can Get Anything She Want
She Can Have Anything She Want
She Be Telling Me Things That I Know That
Turning Me On When She Throw That
Looking So Good When She Walked Past
Looking So Good Had To Grab That
I Guess We Goals Now (Goals Now)
I Guess They Know Now (Know Now)
How We Roll Now

[Hook]
She Say She Love Me
She Say She Fuck With Your Boy
Can't Leave Her Lonely
Do Anything For Your Boy
And I Ain't Ever Had No Shit Like That
Do You Like It When I Kiss Your Lips Like That
Hand On Your Face And Your Hips Like That
Spend A Little Money Get You Did Like That

[Post-Hook]
Spend Money Get You Did Like That
Do You Like It When I Kiss Like That
Hands On Your Hips Like That

[Verse 2]
Tell Her What She Need To Know
Never Tell Her What She Wanna Know (Never That)
I Do Her Right Cause He Did Her Wrong (Fuck Him)
I Do Her Right, She Deserves It All (That's My Baby)
She A Queen Ain't No Topping That (No No)
I'm A King She Gon' Tell You That (Yeah Yeah)
And We Clean Like A Laundromat
We The Real, Y'all Just Copy Cats (Y'all Just Copies)
When You See Her Yeah You Know That's Me
And I'm Better Than That Nigga Times 3
Can't Nobody Have Her But Me
Can't Nobody Do Her Like Me
Can't Nobody Love You Like Me
I Ain't Here To Brag (Nah) 
But I'm The Man
And You Know Your Boy Fly Like He Peter Pan
And You Know Our Love Higher Than The Ceiling Fan
And When I'm In The Crowd I'm Your Biggest Fan

[Hook]
She Say She Love Me
