[Intro]
I still ain't made my move
Lil' Mama

Come and talk to me
I really want to meet you
Can I talk to you
I really want to know you

[Verse 1]
Why you gotta be so fine
Come on over here baby, I don't wanna waste no time
Okay, I'm shy
When we lock eyes, I look at when you're mine
Baby, pretty girls make nervous
I don't wan't to make it seem like you ain't worth this baby
I wan't to say something first
But I'm too scared

[Bridge]
Baby I've been watching you for a long long time
Giving me the signal, what's on your mind
Tell me, will, come and talk to me

[Chorus]
Come and talk to me
I really want to meet you
Can I talk to you?
I really want to know you
Come and talk to me
I really want to meet you
Can I talk to you?
I really want to know, I really want to know

[Verse 2]
Brown-skin girl, I don't want to sound too forward
You got everything a nigga look for in a lady
Make me tell them hoes, I ain't looking for a lady
And every time you smile at me, you bring out the child in me
Baby put a grin on my face
Girl I want to know your name
Mami do you feel the same?

[Bridge]
Baby I've been watching you for a long, long time
Giving me the signal, what's on your mind?
I've been waiting for the go, baby you're so fine
I ain't worried about them others, baby you're so mine

[Chorus]
Come and talk to me
I really want to meet you
Can I talk to you?
I really want to know you
Come and talk to me
I really want to meet you
Can I talk to you?
I really want to know, I really want to know

[Outro]
You look so sexy
You really turn me on
Let me help, make you mine
:
Come and talk to me baby, I'm really feeling you
You just look way too good, I mean its' like
You fly, you sexy, come talk to me for one second
