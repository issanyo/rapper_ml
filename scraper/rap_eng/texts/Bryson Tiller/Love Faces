[Intro]
Lil Mama
It's about that time
You know
You wanna make love faces?
Ha, I bet you do
I got Killer Instinct in the bedroom shawty
Know I'm finna kill it in the bedroom shawty
Don't call me Bryson Tiller in this bedroom
Call me Mr.Killer in the bedroom shawty

[Verse 1]
Pull up hit the horn two times
Then you walked outside
I said, "Girl, wait a minute"
Look too good for the club tonight
Shawty I don't really think I wanna wait to hit
Na na, I want you like right now
And if that thing leaking Imma put pipe down
(You feel me) oh yea
Scratching on my back banging the wall
Them panties soaking wet
Ooo girl, I had to tear them off (oh wetter)
Yeah, I bang it, I bang it
Now I got you speaking Spanglish
I know all of them positions baby, all you gotta do is name em

[Bridge]
Don't it feel good when I go deeper
Wouldn't it feel nice if all night I was in you
I lick it with two fingers in it at the same time (go back down)
Quickies girl forget that, I'mma hit that
You ain't even notice you were

[Hook]
Making love Faces, making love faces
Ya now, I got lots of stamina, no matter who I'm versing
I'm gon put in hella work tonight cause  you deserve it
Making love Faces, making love faces
If you turn them light down, do it right now
We'll make love all night, damn right I swear

[Verse 2]
Girl, once I get my hands around you
(Hands around, hands around)
You won't let me let go, I say round two you say let go
You be playing innocent, but I know that thing is wet though (Climb on top)
Know what I'm on, wrap them legs around my neck bone
You say you can't wait to see if what I say is true now
You making love faces while I'm all inside of you girl
You hooked on my love, now we gon' wait full fighter rounds
Back and fourth go in out, make you scream and holla

[Bridge]
Don't it feel good when I go deeper
Wouldn't it feel nice if all night I was in you
I lick it with two fingers in it at the same time (go back down)
Quickies girl forget that, I'mma hit that
You ain't even notice you were

[Hook]
Making love Faces, making love faces
I got lots of stamina don't matter who I'm versing
I'm gon put in hella work tonight cause you deserve it
Making love Faces, making love faces
If you turn them light down, do it right now
We'll make love all night, damn right I swear
