[Intro: Bryson Tiller]
God Tiller
Hahaha
Aw man, that was one of my lazier ones I said
This shit sound like, uh, 2017 Darth Vader theme song or some shit, I don't know
Shit

[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller]
Oh my God, I'm poppin'
Tiller done got it poppin'
Niggas is down talkin'
I guess they ran outta options, yeah
Like a lost wallet, they outta pocket, ooh
Don't get me started, ayy
That's when a nigga go hardest
Flow get so chaotic
Lambo' look good topless
Dashboard, it's electronic
Khaled say I'm iconic
Nigga, you ain't know none 'bout it
Need twenty million dollars profit
Wifey like to go shoppin'
Goddamn gringo, nigga
Tiller got cheat codes, nigga
Talk to me though, nigga
Better lose your motherfuckin' ego, nigga
I'm married to the beat though, nigga
Need a tuxedo, nigga
Need info come to the seminar, yeah
Your MCM just pulled up to the fountain blue stuntin' in the rental car, yeah
Your MCM just over drafted on the motherfuckin' debit card, yeah
God Tiller, I'm Reptar, yeah
I want this car, that car, yeah
Deaf, deaf to the bullshit, nigga, I'm deaf
I made a lotta money when I started bein' true to myself
A nigga couldn't make me me, I had to do it myself
So that's why I hate when I nigga tell me they could use my help (you don't need me, nigga)
Shout my niggas in Louisville still
All I ever hear, "Shoot, kill kill"
Ridin' through the city, through the Ill Will
That struggle, I made it through that struggle
My vision tunnel, yeah, I want that cake, that funnel

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller & WunTayk Timmy]
Yeah, I just want the cake nigga (yeah)
That funnel cake nigga
I just want the cake nigga
That funnel cake nigga (All The Way)
I'm talking real cake nigga, WunTayk

[Verse 2: WunTayk Timmy]
Stayed down off top and they all off topic
Can't put me in no box and I can't fuck with no opps
About mine no option, I still can't get no props
Niggas want a photo op, I just want a four door drop
Wake up, straight to the money as soon I wake
That's what I do with my day, don't worry what I do with my cake
I'm feelin' like bomaye, been lookin for a guide, but I still got God
So I think I might do it my way, when I pull up,, I look like I race
The outside say what I do and the inside do what I say (that's work)
This time you are not safe (work), I know that I seen you lurk (that's work)
I ain't begging for a damn thing man who gon' need who first? (You)
Pull up and I skrt, rap like Reynolds, no Burt
I got that fire, that lay off
We got that work in a lay off
Put in that work and it pay off
I know my worth when it pay off
Shots at a nigga, don't pay off
Let them keep shootin', they way off
I really can't take no breaks
Young WunTayk gon' take off

[Outro: WunTayk Timmy & Bryson Tiller]
Ayy, WunTayk, WunTayk, WunTayk
WunTayk, WunTayk, WunTayk
Stay down
Come up, stay up
Clique Clan
God Tiller
Socks, what up?
