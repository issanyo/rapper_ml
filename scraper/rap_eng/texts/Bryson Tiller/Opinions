[Intro: Bryson Tiller & DJ Edubb]
Killer instinct
Sometimes
Sometimes
I be feeling like I made it
Sometimes
I be feeling like I'm hated
DJ Edubb, official mixtape
Your wifey's favorite DJ
Come and tell em like it is tho

[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller]
You can tell me what you really think about me (oh)
Tell me how you really feel (you can kill it)
Tell me if you think that I can get signed
Or if I deserve a deal
But everybody tell me something different
About how I should go about it
No I don't even think that I should listen
No fiction nigga, I doubt it
Singing all this music, spitting all these bars
Every time I do it
I give it my heart
I go hard to the fullest
Blow the instrumental brains out no bullets
Man you need to cool it
You so foolish
All you local niggas only in my way (way)

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
Thanks for your opinion, but listen
Homie I don't really need your two cents, you gets no reply
'Cause I don't really give a fuck what you say
Fuck what you say, fuck what you say

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Growing up when I ain't had shit, now everything's all backword's
You be blowing up my inbox talkin' 'bout I need a fucking manager
Swear I thought I told you your opinion doesn't matter
Wait wait wait hollup now you believe in me
Hollup' wait hol-hollup now you tryna put some green in me
Ion need any sari, ya this weed and Bacardi
Got me leanin' with a shawty
In the vip party
That's irrelevant
Nah I'm just tryna show yo ass that without or without you
I'm always movin' fast to the top cuz I'm better than
Anyone who think I give a damn about the fame
I just want to support my fam
Can't while I'm here
I can't wait until I leave I won't put a nigga on
If he ain't put shit on for me
All my niggas they agree, we runnin from second
Face it we winners and I never forget a face

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
Thanks for your opinions but listen homie I dont really need your Two cents, you gets no reply
'Cause I don't really give a fuck what you say, say, say, say
Don't give a fuck what you say, say, say, say
You can keep it to yourself I don't need a handâ€‹ to help {?}

[Outro: Bryson Tiller]
What I'm saying is
I just don't, I don't give a damn about anybody's opinion anymore
Like I'm just gon' do me ok
Is that cool with y'all
I don't care
Look
Thank you everybody for listening though
I really appreciate it
Fucking hate you niggas
Act like DJ Edubb ain't got the motherfucking streets on lock
Take a seat, and use the goddamn tissues
It's DJ Edubb
