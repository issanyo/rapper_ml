[Skit]
All I did is say I have feelings for you
And all you do is shit all over it
And tell me you want me to get over you
And that you want nothing to do with me
That's hurtful, Bryson
I did nothing to you
I've done nothing to you
For a year, all you did was lie to me and talk to other girls
And I'm still hearing it
Okay, I forgive you, let's work with it
I really like you
Last year was a misunderstanding, let's get over it
No more brittle conscience
I forgive you for everything
I've done nothing
And if I did do something
Then and now would be the perfect time to say
'Cause you done everything to me
I never did that to you
I'd never do that to you
