[Intro]
Can I just say
You look amazing in that swimsuit
Can we get along for a second?
I got a secret

[Hook]
Baby, we can do whatever
Do it wherever you want
Long as you just keep it on the low low
Inside, outside, in the pool(oh yeah)
Keep a secret, ain't nobody gotta know
Damn yeah, shawty I'm the motherfuckin' man here
Put it down, on the floor
Just keep it on the low low
Inside, outside, get it in the pool
We can air dry in the living room
Keep it on the low

[Verse 1]
Baby, she ain't gotta know
Baby, he ain't gotta know
And you know what I'm insinuating
We get tired of both
Shawty, keep it on the low
Finna get what you deserve
And that please do not disturb, baby keep it on the door
Baby, I'm in love with your body, I'm in love with your figure
Know you got a man
But girl I don't give a damn about that nigga know
He ain't on the shit I'm on
Climb on top I'm finna make that shit explode
Oh like, boom, boom, boom, boom
Girl we don't gotta be confined inside this room
And I, love it how you do it on the chair
Ain't nobody gotta know

[Pre-Hook]
Oh your shoulders hold 'em up
Put your legs right there

In the bed right there
Are you down? Let me know
Ain't no problem that's for sure

[Verse 2]
Ay, forget about them panties
Come and let me have your bra
You can leave them cookies out
Like my name was Santa Claus
Mama, scratch me with them paws, yeah I love that kitty cat
And if you throw that pussy to me you may never get it back
It feels like, warm summer nights
And I lay in your pool
Imma show you what my tongue is like
And I might play in my food
Is that rude?
Nah, you like that
Girl, your body might shiver, don't fight that
You's a pretty motherfucka, if i go, I'm coming right back
