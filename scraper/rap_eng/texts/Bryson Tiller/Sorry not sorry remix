[Verse One: Bryson Tiller]
I used to think about how you would act when a nigga got money
Now you done switched up on me
Now you wanna say "what's up?" to me
Okay, so now you wanna make love to me
Girl, if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had something special
But you don't mean nothing to me
Girl, I'm sorry you not the one for me
Just be honest, girl what you want from me?
This ain't nothing new, keep it so one-hundred
I can't let none of these niggas get one up on me
I go by God-Tiller, you better run from me
Give hope to my niggas, them niggas love money
Adios to them bitches, can't get a hug from me
I'm high on life, that's what it does for me
My numbers going up, I feel a buzz coming (one up)

[Hook]
Young nigga, young nigga
Your friends bad too?
Then tell 'em come with you
And we like bitches with they own shit
We don't like gold diggers
Girl, if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had something special
But you don't mean nothing to me
Girl, I'm sorry you not the one for me

[Verse Two: Dogo7]
Yeah, hittin' 57s
A bunch of motherfuckers ain't heard of the sixty-sixty seven
It's around where I live but not exactly
Tray Walker, R.I.P. such a tragedy
You say the Ravens are trash, ya ain't seen Cleveland
Their hopes of Super Bowls the exact shade, they ain't seein' it
Call up Alexander Bell and tell em how we use it
Girls are privileges, you abuse em and you lose em (it's true)

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Dogo7]
Yeah, I got a bunch of stacks hangin' on for college
Been thinkin' 'bout shit, you bet I use it for my knowledge
See, I excelled at using Microsoft and I got a strong point
Cuz I got alot of power in using technology
Tryna get to be acknowledging, but motherfuckers
They see through me, can't see me like I'm John Cena
I wanna be a star like I'm the Big Dipper
And I don't wear slippers like I'm anti-Kipper
Sometimes I feel alienated like Spock landed
Artists get messy that's why I'm out here smock handin'
Shit can get sticky, Rubik's like a block candy
You fucks get outta hand, someone get a shock ready
I got a lot in my life, I got the love of my life
I want a job that supports my position in life
I keep on hearing 'bout Trump and Hillary's fuckin' shit
But my friend wants me to vote Kenny Bone for 2020 then (yo)
