Shawty you should come up out your bra and your panties x4
Take off your vicki secret
And that's how we should keep it
For the rest of the night
So freaky, you and I
I think you, I think you really should come out them clothes

[MvP]

Ayy lil mama what you doing over there, huh
I'm unaware but I see you in them underwear, ma
My mind elsewhere so really I don't care, ma
And all I know is I just want you over here now
Now let me tell you how it goes, all I know is if it goes over those, then it goes on the floor
And real mo is how I throw, a pro shawty know
And if your man's green light, you should go shawty, go
I know that ain't right either, don't let your wife beater
When I get to come up out her boy shorts and wife beater
And I ain't expect her not to ever repeat it, she couldn't keep Victoria's Secrets

Yo darling, I swear I'm 'bout to get you out them drawers yeah
Make sure your man can't interrupt us with the calling
Tell him that you shoppin' I be coppin' what you wantin'
Still don't explain why you was gone til the mornin'
And fuck the explanation shawty
Y-You and me cause he ain't fit your expectation shawty
You ain't hesitate to call me, took you to my spot, I had to beat that thing up, screamin' out my god to the neighbors
Your body sexy baby, take off that lingerie
That pussy steamin' like a full course entree
I got you on my pitch, you know my candles lit
Let me know if you can handle it, I know that you can handle it

Shawty you should come up out your bra and your panties x4
Take off your vicki secret
And that's how we should keep it
For the rest of the night
So freaky, you and I
