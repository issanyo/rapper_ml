[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It's a come up, me and my niggas, we all on the rise
Got a whole lot of work to put it, I been on top of mine
Got a new bitch I fuck with tough, she got the same drive
Most niggas change up when the money come, I won't change, nah
Don't compare with me lil nigga, we ain't the same kind
Most of y'all niggas only doing this shit for the fame now
Most niggas change up when the money come, I won't change, nah

[Verse 1: Lil Lonnie]
Most niggas change up for the fame (change)
I thought the motto was go get some money
Used to laugh at me way back
Now I pull up, they don't find nothing funny
Got a new bitch and she keep it a hundred
Last bitch, swear she couldn't be honest, yeah (for real)
I swear this shit so ironic (ironic)
Can't believe a nigga done it (yeah)
It was hard coming up (up)
But I had to stay down
Stay motivated when times get tough (tough)
I'm too deep in it to quit right now (quit right now)
I was fucked up, I got a lil money
And that's when you niggas started coming around
Now I'm in the game making plays
While you niggas waiting, watching out of bounds (yeah)

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It's a come up, me and my niggas, we all on the rise
Got a whole lot of work to put it, I been on top of mine
Got a new bitch I fuck with tough, she got the same drive
Most niggas change up when the money come, I won't change, nah
Don't compare with me lil nigga, we ain't the same kind
And the girl I'm with, she dope and shit, but she ain't mine
Most of y'all niggas only doing this shit for the fame now
Most niggas change up when the money come, I won't change, nah

[Verse 2: Lil Lonnie]
You see the kid on the rise (rise)
I got my eyes on the prize (the prize)
Most of y'all change for the money
But I can not change 'cause I got too much pride (pride)
No we are not equal, no we not the same
You know that I'm one of a kind (I'm one of a kind)
You can't see me, put your glasses on
Better read between the lines (yeah)
Can't mix the money with fame (no)
Make sure you straighten your family (straighten)
'Cause half your homies, they gon' change (change)
But you know that shit there come naturally (for real)
I can't let it stop me, I gotta keep going
And come up with a good strategy (for real)
Continue the greatness, I know I won't change
I cannot act like how these rappers be (yeah)

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It's a come up, me and my niggas, we all on the rise
Got a whole lot of work to put it, I been on top of mine
Got a new bitch I fuck with tough, she got the same drive
Most niggas change up when the money come, I won't change, nah
Don't compare with me lil nigga, we ain't the same kind
And the girl I'm with, she dope and shit, but she ain't mine
Most of y'all niggas only doing this shit for the fame now
Most niggas change up when the money come, I won't change, nah
