[Intro: Frost Vegas]

I remember when we was in the whip talking, vibing out You mentioned how it all made you feel. Not just the music, but as well as the whole mode
You said it was kinda like being in a Euphoria. The feeling was there I could read it in your eyes. You needed some of that throw music in your life
I was the only one from the city that could put you in that spot. Your boy had to make a move. Yo Tiller "One Time For A, One Time For A"
Yea Asap

[Verse 1 Frost Vegas]

Stadium rap I come intact with a gat. 2 shells on a nigga they seeing us on the map
I was showing em the light. these niggas wouldn't even match.  Fly Psalms. I think they remember that
Give me everything I want it. I want it I'll give it back. Falling for you love. you love when the time lapse. you love in all of the lights. you love when I call back
Everything you love me. know its a fact
I was running  for the cash. I was running for the cash. I was running for the money
Lips taste like honey. Sweat as a bunny. Ima keep you  running as long as you don't run with them other bitches
Kisses I want her lipstick on my dick tip. kinda sorry I don't mean to sound vicious
Can't miss out on.  another premonition. they try to tell me that you just another mistress
These niggas want all the shine. These these niggas want all ya time. See these niggas go out of there way. but these niggas all get denied
I just call you every other week. you a freak but I give you whatever u need . I'm going deep. that's how you feel it never shocked us and I don't need to send a text I just pop up
A nigga stock up
