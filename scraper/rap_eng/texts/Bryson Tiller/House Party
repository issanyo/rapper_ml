[Intro: DJ E Dubb & Bryson Tiller]
DJ E Dubb
We setting the streets on fire
The mixtape police taking this shit over nigga, nigga

[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller]
Look at here
And you just walked up out of a magazine
You just tell your whole crew that you're leaving this here
Just took a brain for me
She in the club, forget about a deal
There's a house party going on in my crib
Tell me is you down, baby, are you around
Everybody coming over, let me show you how to party
Actress, you touch me all
Somebody, working in two bottles of Ciroc
You want to get loose
You ain't have thing, you should given me clues
Head up to my room, I'ma tell you what to do
Saying, we gon party all night
We just, after I hit it
Come with me baby

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It will be one of the best decisions of your life
Like, bring your ladies, hit that bitch
I'm comfortable
I was partying
Because my homies want to, my homies lent me liquor
Now this party jumping
We gon' keep the music bumping
On my way from the club to the crib

[Verse 2: MVP & Bryson Tiller]
Tell me what I got to do to get right next to you
You gotta be the baddest thing in this club, girl
Tied up in the jeans, did ya right
Ooh, a nigga looks good in the city lights
Get it popping, if you thinking that it feels right
Tell me if you're rolling tonight
Ya, you been right there, just twerking all night
Been thinking all of this time
Baby, you're just our type
Tell me if you're rolling babe
Tell me if you're rolling babe
Tell me if you're rolling with me babe
Tell me if you're rolling babe
Tell me if you're rolling babe

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It will be one of the best decisions of your life
Like, bring your ladies, hit that bitch
I'm comfortable
I was partying
Because my homies want to, my homies lent me liquor
Now this party jumping
We gon' keep the music bumping
On my way from the club to the crib

[Verse 3: Bryson Tiller]
Everybody look in here
Everybody looking like they slobbin' here
I don't want to hear niggas complaining
Way too many bad bitches
Throw your hands up
Let me see you bad bitches, everybody up in here
Gonna look like we crabbin' here
I don't want to hear niggas complaining
Way too many bad bitches
Throw your hands up
Let me see you bad bitches, everybody up in here

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It will be one of the best decisions of your life
Like, bring your ladies, hit that bitch
I'm comfortable
I was partying
Because my homies want to, my homies lent me liquor
Now this party jumping
We gon' keep the music bumping
On my way from the club to the crib
