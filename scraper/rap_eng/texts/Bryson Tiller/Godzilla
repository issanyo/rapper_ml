[Intro: Bryson Tiller]
Godzilla is still alive
That's right, ugh
That's right
Ya, hahahahahaha

[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller]
Where ya at
Mission right in front of ya
Little money funded, I be making fun of ya
Ate so many beats, I think I might need a toney test
Stunting like this weak shit, finna get this honey nut
Honey wet, bitch, I do not do nicknames, ho
You can call me Selfish, but that's only for my main ho
And every time I'm in that thang, she begin to sing songs
These other niggas minutemen, like ringtones
God sent, I finna murder these oafers
They don't want beef when I got hamburger helpers
And I hate being a teacher, 'cuz they don't learn lessons
And when these women show up, that's when I turn selfish
Bitch, I'm way too gigantic, go call the army
Hey you should panic, because I don't show no mercy
Homie, I'm a monster, you niggas better hurry
Cuz I'm going for the title, bitch, I'm cold like I'm a McFlurry

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
I tell 'em
Little niggas run for your life
I been in the city, all my life
You ain't talking money, then you ain't speaking right
I prolly look familiar, cuz I am Godzilla
I ain't see another nigga if he ain't my height
Damn
I guarantee these niggas finna know who I am
See I'm pointing to the sky, like Lil Godzilla man
Carry on as a monster, a lot of niggas ran

[Verse 2: Magnum]
I do it
Magnum, wrap it up
Skinny nigga, and I'm tat, tat, tatted up
Give me that, that, that added up
What it cost? I don't give a fuck, bag it up
They mad as fuck, know they only want to murder cap me
Cuz I just bring them to the nest, make them birdies happy
Fly ass nigga, bet your bird attack me
Give me a name and a number, she threw a turkey at me
I've been on a fucking winning streak
Told you we were just friends, but I heard your bitch was into me
Shit, I'm finna be
Fucking, I ain't trying to wait
Don't need to check my calendar, cuz I ain't even tryna date
And I keep doing shit for you that your momma can't
And baby we don't talk, we just conversate
I do it to a bitch, I can't accommodate
Cuz Godzilla, boy, I dominate

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
I tell 'em
Little niggas run for your life
I been in the city, all my life
You ain't talking money, then you ain't speaking right
I prolly look familiar, cuz I am Godzilla
I ain't see another nigga if he ain't my height
Damn
I guarantee these niggas finna know who I am
See I'm pointing to the sky, like Lil Godzilla man
Carry on as a monster, a lot of niggas ran

[Verse 3: Bryson Tiller]
Like hip-hop, oh right, I can tell you that for nothing
Cash flow, mister register
Raptor, forever I'm a predator
Rug rat nigga, gotta pick a fur, Angelica
When niggas tell me their shit is cold, I can tell they lying
Just sit around and I get better, like some cellar wine
If I see another monster, it's Van Helsing time
Never with some wings, nigga, you can count me as hella fly
You gotta feel me, like I page yo ass sucka
I ain't gon' eat it, I'ma cater that pussy
I'm cold, and that is where I'm taking these rookies
And no faking me wussy, you a make believe, could he, would he
With a cable, thing it's impossible
Ain't nobody burn me, bitch, I'm hotter than saliva, healthy
Never be killing, we really eating, it's just a hippy, boy, you silly sir
I can tell some nigga, they about to get their feelings hurt

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
I tell 'em
Little niggas run for your life
I been in the city, all my life
You ain't talking money, then you ain't speaking right
I prolly look familiar, cuz I am Godzilla
I ain't see another nigga if he ain't my height
Damn
I guarantee these niggas finna know who I am
See I'm pointing to the sky, like Lil Godzilla man
Carry on as a monster, a lot of niggas ran
