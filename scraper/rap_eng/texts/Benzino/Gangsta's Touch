[Chorus]:
See it ain't nothin but the gangsta's touch
That make em wanna ride with us
So come on mami hop on in this truck
People runnin leakin like Angel Dust

So come on mami hop on in this truck
People runnin leakin like Angel Dust

[Cadillac Tah]:
Gangsta's get it goin chips and steady growin while haters are steady
Plottin whatever we told them and poppin Ma I know you love it when
We rollin sittin in that baby blue blow this gangsta clean and straight

Roadies gotta love us something to bottom borrow choke the fifth you're
Bones saggin I'm tryin to see what's happenin lil mama what's crackin

Hungry we can go get a lobster sugar listen you dealin with big sippin
Players who want to be pimps drinkin all that garbage

[Chorus]

Obsessed with the fact she ain't leavin me alone okay mama you want it

Dawg with a gangsta touch

Gangsta but I ain't gonna hurt ya so holla at us we got bottles to bust
And models to touch thug life gangstas 'R us plus we them ballas to click
With big six fifth shit with God as my witness

[Chorus]
