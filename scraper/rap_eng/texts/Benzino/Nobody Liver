[Hook: Pink]
Every time you come to town you pick me up
Every time you come around you lit me up
Even though you're not around you know you want me [you know]
All I want to do is kick it from tonight
All I ask is that you stay just one more night
All I want is to here you say you want me

[Benzino]
See ain't nobody liver
Like DC3 I'm a survivor
I stay candid
Four seat branded
Front standard
Dirt bandit with two cannons [bleow!]
Here's what the plans is
A good life for me and my mans's
In the studio paid off stanzas
So in the long run
Every song done gotta be bananas
From city streets to corporate suits
From these gritty beats
All heat and nothing sweet
Get a good look, I'm here to stay
Benzino gonna show you how the big dogs play

[Hook: Pink]
Every time you come to town you pick me up
Every time you come around you lit me up
Even though you're not around you know you want me [you know]
All I want to do is kick it from tonight
All I ask is that you stay just one more night
All I want is to here you say you want me

[Benzino]
Black ice on the neck and wrist [that's Benzino]
Most hated at the top of the list [that's Benzino]
Hangman with the gangsta hits [that's Benzino]
Top dog that you never forget [that's Benzino]
Watch me turn up the thermostat I burn it black
I want the platinum plaque, y'all can have the game back
Price of fame
More friends more foes new Benz new clothes no sleep no doe
Hate to see me doin it, love the chance to ruin it
Ferrari in the hood, you know who in it
Thug nigga, Benzino mob figga
Put some E in the liquor then its easy to hit her
Straight out the gate full plate bread winner
Always in the paint part saint part sinner
I'm young, black and rich and I'm talkin shit
The one with the six and still poppin the clip

[Hook: Pink]
Every time you come to town you pick me up
Every time you come around you lit me up
Even though you're not around you know you want me [you know]
All I want to do is kick it from tonight
All I ask is that you stay just one more night
All I want is to here you say you want me

[Benzino]
I switched up the game but I'm still the same
How fame got the whole world callin my name [Benzino!]
Glad I came
I keep the flame
Call it how I see it
The streets to blame
Tryin do me
Live stress free
Stay away from bullshit, y'all know me
Still pull shit and let go of freaks
Toss you in a thug pit
Real thug shit
Real hip-hop, hard as concrete
I see lots of money and pounds of treats
Now check it, I rip mics and sell records
Sign autographs, respect to accept it

[Hook: Pink] (Benzino)
Every time you come to town you pick me up, (yeah, Ray Benzino)
Every time you come around you lit me up, (un-hunh, Pink, c'mon)
Even though you're not around you know you want me [you know]
All I want to do is kick it from tonight
All I ask is that you stay just one more night (what)
All I want is to here you say you want me
