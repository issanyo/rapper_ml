[Foxy Brown]
While you hoes play rich
I'm a made bitch
It's funny how you bitches forget
Who the don-ga-gun bitch?
Filthy rich and I don't hate
I still throw on some Sean John shit
Ears all rocking, ankle frostbit
Fox to cocky, nigga know your place
Nigga won't fuck this til I cop a case
Face no dudes in this shit, I'm a classy bitch
A niggas style and my dot six shits
Before I run through prada and skate through the district
Niggas wanna see me on some real flip shit
Cop my biscuit on some fuck-a-do shit
What, niggas forgot that I'm a B.K. bitch
And it gets no iller than this, cocksucker

[Benzino]
Is it the rocks on my wrist that got you amazed?
Or the cars that I whip that got you dazed?
Or the way I be lookin when I rock my braids
And of course y'all know, my niggas amazed
So fuck what you heard
Its simple and plain
Benzino cock back shit to shock your brain
Can't stop that til I lock this game
Won't hold back, I want lots of fame

Niggas got to meet me at the bar
Take a bitch to burp off while I'm sliding off

Hookas better meet us at the bar
We ain't gone shop unless its on and pop

[Benzino]

Don't try and risk it
