MT, Benzino, Daz Dilly
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, I'm back with a hit at this dumpster
Plus your speakers dump that real shit to blow out your twist
Pull out your heaters if you're cold, warm it up, get it up
My niggas and my bitches get your hands, get 'em up
I gets rough ride, get it raw like never before
Hard core explore, nigga to knock down your door
It seems you can't take no more, so stick 'em up
Now give it up to get your nigga's buck, what the fuck?
I struck a match, I tip my hat to the left
I get them niggas, with the laws of death, I got the rep
Motherfucker, my name is Daz, I'll whoop ass
Everyday, all day, I count big ass cash
It's just I keep on comin' with it, I know you're scared with it
It's Diggy Daz and Benzino back on a fuckin' mission
Oh no, nigga I'm back with another dose
And if you niggas don't know, I rock coast to coast
I hit you with that click-clack, in that pick-pack
Niggas wanna do that and they said that I did that
The D A to the Z and Mr. Dillinger willin' to fuck a priest
Now my niggas, you know who run the streets
Every time I come around to your club or the spot, we got it hot
All my niggas and bitches, why don't you yell it out?
(Daz)
And if you see me coast to coast
Don't act like you seen a ghost
Just scream it out
Benzino, temperature is risin'
I want you inside me, touchin' on my body
Boy, you got me burnin' and I can't hide this feeling
Extra hot and I'm waitin' for you
I'm steady livin' and shit, you see it's evident
I canary wearin' it, I'm not even not even hearin'
Ya meet her at the Meridian
Unforgettable experience, hit that
I'm killin' it, macked out, I'm swervin' it
Crapped out your nervousness stacks
I be deservin' them cats
I'm not concerned with them
Who do I never heard of ya act out?
I murder ya, blast out I'm burnin' ya
Niggas ain't that appalin'
And chicks I be importin' them
Fly that ass Zino, put you up in first class
She bring a coat for D A Z at the crib with L-T
Feelin' doggy-style, part three
Every time I come around to your club or the spot, we got it hot
All my niggas and bitches, why don't you yell it out?
(Daz)
And if you see me coast to coast
Don't act like you seen a ghost
Just scream it out
Benzino, temperature is risin'
I want you inside me, touchin' on my body
Boy, you got me burnin' and I can't hide this feeling
Extra hot and I'm waitin' for you
Click-clack, I'm bustin' 'em, hit stacks, I'm clutchin' 'em
This track, I'm crushin' 'em, back door, I'm rushin' it
Flip rhymes, complete with it, hit dimes, I'm sick with it
Grit nines, I'm spittin' it, ass hard, he feelin' it
Blast off, I'm pealin' it, drop-top, be wheelin'
And everybody be sayin' that "Benzino is the realest thing"
Now here we go again, let's get this dough again, fuck it
I fly to Logan and Zino rip up the show again
Chronic steady, smokin' it, the drama never provokin' it
Niggas already knowin' that Jacob, he keeps me glowin'
And East we keep it hustlin', South they keep it crunk
And West they keep it comin' and West they keep on gunnin' it
Every time I come around to your club or the spot, we got it hot
All my niggas and bitches, why don't you yell it out?
(Daz)
And if you see me coast to coast
Don't act like you seen a ghost
Just scream it out
Benzino, temperature is risin'
I want you inside me, touchin' on my body
Boy, you got me burnin' and I can't hide this feeling
Extra hot and I'm waitin' for you
Every time I come around to your club or the spot
We got it hot, all my niggas and bitches, why don't you yell it out?
