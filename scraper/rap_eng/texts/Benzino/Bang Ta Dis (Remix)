[Intro: Benzino]
Un, un

Yo, can't hang wit dis
Can't hang wit dis, bitch-ass niggas

[Chorus: Benzino]
Stop what your doin and slang ta dis
Pull your guns out and bang ta dis
We don't give a fuck if you hate and shit
You bitch niggas still can't hang with dis

[Hook 4x: Benzino]
Blood, slugs, murder, jail
Pussy, drugs, power, bail

[Prodigy]
Nigga, I throw you in the shark cage - straight Mobb nigga
And nigga P ain't playin no games, fuck with 'em
I have you niggas runnin around with shails
I have you niggas buyin guns, for real
Pattin on 'em, might pop up and lay things down
You absolutely right, niggas get laid out
Niggas is out they head going at me
Nigga you ready to die, I'm ready to squeeze
Fuck it, I ain't backing down or backing up
I got that bomb shit - you get blowin up
When my razor touch ya head, neck and face
And I'ma give you that shot, rest in peace

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Benzino]
I spend my whole life tryin to get paid for this
I watched Rock get slayed for this
I kept it gangsta - niggas.. don't.. want.. it
Betta yet, motherfuckers can't take it
Strike back so there whole squad suffer
Attack niggas til they can't get enough of...
I got RSO blood in my vein
Made Men take it there, for see no pain
I run with niggas that see no pain
And cock them things, dip quick in the Range
Unsolved murderers, cold case niggas
Undescribable, when we squeeze those triggers
Invisible like night glove
Shine like a nickel four-fifth, bitch slang to this, c'mon

[Hook]

[Bars & Hooks]
Yeah, it's real ill when a classic album drop
But it's real fucked up when a classic album flop
And your sweet dreams turn into nightmares - your plans get crushed
It seems like the grands been flushed
But since it's all for diniero, you can't give up
We gotta keep hope alive and, keep strivin
Keep scribin, and don't give up til we Diamond
If any nigga get in our way squeeze iron

[Bars & Hooks]
Yeah, we gang bang him, we shoot him til we dyin
Act like a nigga said "Bars", and empty out fry him
Shoot that nigga, cut that nigga til we dyin
Cause he wanted to lay down, and we couldn't deny him
So nigga, get up out or way, we don't play
Ain't no nigga, ain't no bitch, ain't nobody I won't spray
You niggas is ass, my niggas is Made, y'all mens is two throat, my niggas is too big
Who want it?  Come bring it, let's bang, motherfucker

[Chorus]
