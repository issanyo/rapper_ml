(Benzino):
In the studio all night makin' hits
Since you claim I don't right I'm a put it like this
Benzino shit tight when I flex my wrists
Check the publishing dawg I gets checks for this
And the public gonna love with the check for this
Motivated by the hate you better check the list
Shit's climbin' homeboy you better check these whips
Fully loaded with a tech two extra clips
Now it wasn't really that long ago
When I put it down with my team almighty R.S.O
Hustler by night make beats in the day
Had that thing under the bed if you f**k with Ray
Damn shame why we gotta live this way
Protect my life by any means I ain't dyin' today
And I love rap music it's the reason I'm alive
And my faith in God is the reason I survive what

(Chorus):
I'm prayin' forever
I gotta find another way up
Ain't no way I'll ever give up
I'm stayin' forever
And there ain't nothin' holdin' me down
Ain't no way to count me out

(Benzino):
Not too many chose the path that young Zino took
Where the R.S.O. or Made Men cats we shook
I find it hard to believe that dawg's still livin'
Let alone makin' music and I in prison
Destiny's some shit you can't avoid
Build a solid foundation and you can't destroy
Me Jeff and JD we keepin' it real
We stay-in homeboys f**k a record deal
Shit don't move less you got somethin' to prove
Caught up in the streets go gun for gun
Since day one I know I stack a million plus
Maintain keep my cash flow up bumble and sickly
Still got my .38 with me and my gangsta tight
Like invincible shit get critical
You face I ain't feelin' you
Dead upon arrival it's all about survival
I'm a rep for my title

(Chorus)
(Benzino):
Dead before dishonor I'm a scream it loud
Put in work Four Corners where I move the crowd
Undenied my dawg's were the best around
Media constantly tryin' to test my ground
Attitude real 'noyed my trust is gone
Temper always flare up my patience worn
Association's a bitch when you known by all
Conspiracy with a snitch wanna see me fall
Raw shit revoke I don't seem to ever learn my lesson
Hayes blowin' out the roof spray envy and blessin'
Ray face the truth when niggas start confessin'
Hot up in the booth I hope I answered all your questions

(Chorus)
Ain't no way to count me out
I'm gon' be here for you babe
We gotta find a way out
Ain't no way I'll ever give up
