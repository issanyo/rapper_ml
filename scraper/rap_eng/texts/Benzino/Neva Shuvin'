[Benzino]:
I wake up every mornin nigga get up
I grab my tech just in case I gotta tear up
I said that same shit about ten years ago
Same nigga but now my tech is by my window
Been reppin threes wearin black
Since the days of block parties hollow tips and stolen Cadillacs
Been dodgin guns every other fuckin day
Moms can't understand {what's come over it}
Runnin up the weed spots everybody lay the say
Everybody gone up in your parkin
Gun shot to your boy where your wallet
Mr. Benzino kill a man just for profit
[M3]:
Yo it's the city of the grime
And I stay with my nine
Slangin and bangin with Boston niggas that rap Hangmen
So when you talk Bean town call me out
And end up with a small fuckin Glock in your mouth
Niggas
Boston, Mass keep it thug with niggas
We never shuvin niggas we try to hug you niggas
It's the love it's the love
We never shuvin niggas we try to hug you niggas

[M3]:
It's the usual suspect
When it's better suitin with the tech
Cause I'm known to keep one on deck
I checks niggas sometime I have to correct niggas
Sometimes it nothin at all just disrespect niggas
I can't stand a snitch lovin niggas that ain't a bitch
No nigga hatin cause I'm tryin to get rich
Money don't make me a man
Whether I'm paid or I'm broke
I'm gon still be Mr. Mic meaner from outta town
With a clientel like hell
Cause I'm a hustler that raise sin in these streets
That I ain't sold and I that can't sell
Plus I'm gifted to be connected
I get a turno cause someone to turn on after I whips it
Cause I'm a dealer boy clothes at the tailor boy
This ain't no gimmick little nigga this is the real McCoy
Despite the masses in the gloves they're still thugs
I'm still in these streets so I'm a home town and a most loved
Boston, Mass keep it thug with niggas
We never shuvin niggas we try to hug you niggas
It's the love it's the love
We never shuvin niggas we try to hug you niggas
Cause it's the love my niggas
It's the love...
[Wyclef Jean]:
Yo I got a call from Ray Benzino he sent me from Imadapan
They greeted me with two kisses you know I'm a Made Man
How ya think I got the name Hatician Sicillian
After I do the prom I change colors like a chamelleon
Now understand this refugee got plans to better the land
So when the revolution come I keep my gun in hand
And that's the truth Wyclef will put two in your goose
And use your head like the hunters do to a moose
It's the L it's the O it's the V it's the E
From the C double O from the L G double E
Still crush numb in the E three double O
Pedal to the floor before you can say go
Ay yo I'm a say this one time stay off my dick
You're not in my league so sit Boo Boo sit
Let geezie you spit all lines legit
Scientists got the formula to come cop the hit
Boston, Mass keep it thug with niggas
We never shuvin niggas we try to hug you niggas
It's the love it's the love
We never shuvin niggas we try to hug you niggas
Cause it's the love my niggas
It's the love...
