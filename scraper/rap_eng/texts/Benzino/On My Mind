Let me tell you all thats on my mind (repeat x4)

Why take one bad apple to f**k the whole batch
With alot of willpower to get shit back
Things got low some habbits have its own track
Niggas was hatin but i ain't here to dwell on that [no]
G´s dump they packs on 'cause they dont try to slang the shit
Lil homies catchin charges they ain't makin a thing to take
Shantes a nympho all she want is weed or dick
Frankies on cell ? but he keep on blazin em
Murders on a 6 year Tony's bout to come home
DJ´s a hustler JV keeps a gun on him
Ben pissin a hallways mixed
Got a nigga comin home to such a horrible stench
Memorials on every pole and fence
Everyday someones head get clipped for somethin small as a nit
Its like wake after wake if this life ain't a bitch then why police see us all as shit

[Chorus]
Deep Thoughts and visions of me going
Like a tumour in the head im fed it keeps growin
But me knowin never fall and keep holdin
But the size the games showin suprised i ain't foldin
Not enough i gotta worry bout the hood
Some gon do me dirty some gon treat me good
And even if i could rewind back time
Ill be on the same block with the same ol' grind

Girl makin my head hurt carryin deadweight
But i ain't sick thats the road that a man takes
But when i break who gon glue me back
When chicks kick my pieces and move my act
I got the mind of a mad man goin insane
Russian roulette until it blows the back of my brain
Things ain't the same i can see that clear
Two years in this game but we still here

[Chorus]
The games changin i told you
Record lables can't control me
I stay ahead im never foldin
I'm breakin bread with my soldiers
The hood lose no matter whos in office
Its really hard to choose when the feds is watchin
Niggas doin time just for simply sellin crack
Never really had nothin but the clothes on their back
[Let me tell you] Who i am
And i can make you niggas understand
I got a lot of things on my mind
D.A want me up doin all my time
Niggas droppin dimes
Police stakin out
Girls erkin my nerven feel like brakin out
Ones i used to love dont care how i make it now
All bout being real from north being fake's about
