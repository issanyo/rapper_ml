Guess who's comin through right now, bitch?
To smack you with the force to kill a fucking cow, bitch
Hunh, I told you not to fuck around, bitch
Foul nigga, that's the way we gettin down, bitch
You shook faggot, I'ma keep you motherfuckers shaking
And run around just like a crazy big foot Jamaican
See there's no mistaking, see you can never replace me, nigga
They think you alien, whippin shit like a hated nigga
I wonder, wise guy trife and said to me
What we be on and that we would have a recipe
Talk, what they talkin bout rude boy?
Some gully niggas up in the place, we comin through, boy

Fuck a bus - we private jet Motown
Boston streets.. where I put my flow down
Hold up, you shakin it fast, bitch slow down
Blaze shots for the gangster in me
You scared to carry heat, don't hang with me (Motherfucker)
Big guns, no thang to me
Top three is what I aim to be
Hunh, and what I rep.. mainly 3
Ain't no muthafucka spittin flames like me

Bring bitch out of the bubbs warrior style
Throwing bricks, bottles and slugs (Get it on son!)

Just to make this shit more hotter
So tighten up your training wheels bitch...
Cause your fucking with a scholar
