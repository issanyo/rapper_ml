She said she want to get to know me
Even though she smashed the homie
I'm just saying what they told me
I try to tell her keep it lowkey

She want to do it like some animals
I said I'm with it 'cuz for real girl I'm an animal
If we did that it be more that you can handle though
I'm off that kush
I'm off that liquor
I'm a animal
Uh, hold it! This beat is the shit
I'm at the bank still holding my dick
Yeah! Hold this smack while I empty the clip
Yeah Hand me straight while I emplee the fifth
That's when I got on my animal shit
Still a savage for this paper I'm handling shit
About my business catch you later I'm better than this
I'm on your tv screen but still I will shatter this bitch

At night she creep in my bed and she yawnin
And then she creep out at 6 in the morning
Skurr! She always riding in something that's foreign
Said I excited her nigga's so boring
And she be loving that animal dick
Silence of the Lambs straight Hannibal shit
Specially when its dark and the candles are lit
No Love and Hip-Hop this is some animal shit

See that new louis luggage;I copped it. (WOoh)
Secretaries get beat in my office
No, it's not enough so I turn down them offers
Fuck them niggas 'cuz I get on my animal shit
I come through with a hundred killers go ham in this bitch
Leave you no choice motherfuckers gone have to submit
We tore it down and you said, "Look what them animals did."
