[Intro]
Yeah
You thought it was over?
Nah
You can't get rid of me
I'm your arch nemesis
And I'm not stopping
'Til I've accomplished what I've came here for
Complete elimination

[Verse 1]
It's about to be the death of Slim Shady
A little over 2 years, he still can't face me
That shit you pulled up in the D was a slick move
You should have got Dave, cause now I'm gon' get you
And I ain't even press up on you like I should
Double up on your security, wish a nigga would
Tryna run up to the station
And I'll be waiting here with fully automatics macs, running out of patience
Got a fucking nerve taking me to trial
For copyright infringement, you said it was a freestyle
And you lied about your age, you was 21
And never ever make a move with an empty gun
I'll go to war, never folded
Snipe you on the 50-yard line while you talking to Sway
Or while you walking with Dre, it don't matter
Catch you at the show, you ain't built for battle

[Hook 1]
(It was me) that made you stop doing shows in the States
(It was me) that made the call to put Pauly on the tape
(It was me) that made your uncle put the burner to his face
"You can run but you can't hide, I'll find ya"
(It was me) that got your boy Proof served in Miami
(It was me) that struck a nerve when I said Fuck Hailie
(It was me) that ultimately put an end to Slim Shady
"You crossed the wrong motherfucker, now you paranoid"

[Verse 2]
Paul told me on his celly, coward you a lightweight
Steve Stoute can never front cause he the same way
Your whole circle's just a bunch of little bitches
Tap dancing niggas, and weight lifting snitches
And I know I didn't hear you say you helped building rap
You're a puppet, sitting like a kid in Jimmy's lap
Makaveli rolling over in his grave
You fucking up his music, the beats don't bang
And where's your girl Kim? I need to get my dick sucked
I heard she like coke, she wanna get her face fucked
But I ain't freaking with no trailer park trash
I'll leave that shit to you Marshall Math, I'll pass
What's the use of having papers, if you hide it?
I can see the Source awards, but missing at the Vibe?
How can you call yourself the number one rapper
XXL showing love to a cracker

[Hook 1]
(It was me) that made you stop doing shows in the States
(It was me) that made the call to put Pauly on the tape
(It was me) that made your uncle put the burner to his face
"You can run but you can't hide, I'll find ya"
(It was me) that got your boy Proof served in Miami
(It was me) that struck a nerve when I said Fuck Hailie
(It was me) that ultimately put an end to Slim Shady
"You crossed the wrong motherfucker, now you paranoid"

[Verse 3]
Heard up on the radio, you said you want to squash beef
It's kinda funny, to me this shit was never beef
In Puerto Rico with the burner in hand
Ran up on Green Lantern, he almost shit in his pants, damn
Raise the white flag, I'm charging up the hill
Nail in the coffin, I'm impossible to kill
I'm your worst nightmare, the reaper in the flesh
Its a fight 'til the finish, a battle 'til the death
Dressing like a woman just to sell a few copies
Disrespecting Mike, Em you getting sloppy
Your albums is atrocious, Jimmy's scared in double
Fuck a D12 cause their careers are in trouble
Angie needs to get your nuts up out her mouth
Enuff's a dickrider, I'll air these niggas out
And anybody else who wanna try to hold ya
Cause in all reality, you're the only toy soldier

[Hook 1]
(It was me) that made you stop doing shows in the States
(It was me) that made the call to put Pauly on the tape
(It was me) that made your uncle put the burner to his face
"You can run but you can't hide, I'll find ya"
(It was me) that got your boy Proof served in Miami
(It was me) that struck a nerve when I said Fuck Hailie
(It was me) that ultimately put an end to Slim Shady
"You crossed the wrong motherfucker, now you paranoid"

[Hook 2]
(It was me) that made you stop doing shows in the States
(It was me) that made the call to put Pauly on the tape
(It was me) that made your uncle put the burner to his face
"I'm on the hunt so keep your shit low"
(It was me) that got your boy Proof served in Miami
(It was me) that struck a nerve when I said Fuck Hailie
(It was me) that ultimately put an end to Slim Shady
"But yo, I'm kinda slacking up, I should've killed you from the get-go"

[Benzino talking during Hook 1 & Hook 2]
Cocksucker
It was me, Benzino
You know where I'm at
You are scared to a flea motherfucker
Huh
[?]
Hangmen 3 motherfucker
You know what it is
Huh
Oh believe that shit
But don't think we gonna run into each other
We gon' see
