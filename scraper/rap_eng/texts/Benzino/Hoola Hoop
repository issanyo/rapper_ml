[Chorus]:
Let's go Ma what you shakin with show me what you makin with
I got a hoola hoop show me what your ass can do
Money how you workin with show me what you're twerkin it
I got a hoola hoop let's go

[Benzino]:
Mami what you drinkin on
Tell me who you sneakin on
Gucci print Air Force with your sneakers on
Hair done phat streaks twist black and blonde
Throw a song on mami get her groove on
Prada lace black blouse with a matching thong
Pretty face in the place what you sittin for
Once you wind up on your waist what you hittin for
Glitter on your face seven karats on you face
Caged out Cartiers Zino stay glowin
Price tag I don't care you niggas ain't knowin
Where we goin with this breathe how we flowin with this
What we doin with this breathe where we movin with this
Top down in the front vallet don't front
What you want we gon do it my way so

[Chorus 2x]
[Benzino]:
Navy blue with Sean John G suit
This time with the camel ten quarter Timb boot
Ma you know my resume take you to a better place
Skip the line first class when we get away
Baby always smellin good honey always yellin hood
Blue Coupe deuce time threes now it's really good
Shoes beat deuce threes now it's really hood
Blue jeans lately now I'm feelin you
Got me goin crazy I mean I'm feelin you
Plus I'm screamin out your names in the interviews
Oh where we goin with this breathe how we flowin with this
What we doin with this breathe where we movin with this
Slap a bolly on your wrist when I ice you
N 5-5 in the garage when I wife you

[Chorus 2x]
[Benzino]:
Doll baby lookin right candles burning all night
Incense heave scents drum towers hit the light
Mamasita wanna ride me oh seniorita wanna wind it
Strapped up in the Versace bedspread
Let's do the damn thing baby Zino do the damn thing
Where we goin with this breathe how we flowin with this
Where we goin with this breathe where we movin with this
Got you in my hideout let me find out turn you wide out
Baby girl where your hoola hoop

[Chorus 2x]
