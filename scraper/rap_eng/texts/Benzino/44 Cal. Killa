Haven't you ever heard (Trackmasters) a killa

[Benzino]:
Zino

44 Caliber killa

[Benzino]:
Face, Young Mcneil

44 Caliber killa

[Benzino]:
I beat my meat so I can come through on any block start come-dumping Zino don't
Stop stop shootin I'm my mouth cause I got A taste for the stuff

If you bring me the pain I'll straight up let you this me cause my heart's made A mud and my lyrics are from disney

I been known to blow Scarface so that I could walk the yard
And my dad's A fake pacino wit A boyfriend named bernard

Chorus

[M3]:
It ain't no secret if let me I'll get down on my knees and blow you
I got semi-automatics with beams but I'd rather kiss yer bozack

I prefer the 44 Caliburs cause it's bigger in my mouth

Got A little rag called source and it's street cred has gone south
Horus (2x)
