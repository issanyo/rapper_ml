Verse 1: Fabolous
I bet cutie wanna freak
Don't matter if she don't come as a maxim or a jet bootee of the week
Give 'em what cooties when I speak
I usually flash thousands flirt for invisibly set jewies on a freak
It's likely I'm a take boo in the cut
Take her back to Spike Lee & have her doin' the butt
& I'm a mention
Just the way you shake it make my little soldiers stand at attention
My hands goe be inchin'
Cause I'm standin' there flinchin'
Tryin' to hold my hand back from pinchin'
But, ma I can't follow too long
Unless you look like a model who on
& swallow new bons
I'm the kid in the XL Model Yukon
That get more numbers than a lot of coupons
Yo, F-A-B go scanty
Ma, you know how many I leave with no panties

Bootee
5 Times

I see Bootee

Verse 2: Benzino
Benzino, if you can't stand the heat get the fuck out the kitchen
Chauffer driven limousines straight outta prison
In jewelery, man listen
Masterpiece was out to long I never wore presidentials
Still payin' for the shit Jacob lent you (Bootee)
Still waitin' for the check the label sent you (Bootee)
I'm still doin' things you can't imagine (Bootee)
That's there for blastin'
Bangin' on wax that's bootee
Face it Teddy banged tracks
Zino lace it
I like the chicks with the big fat ones
When you back that ass up all you feel is my gun
Hourglass ass you a mo'fucker boo
So please believe it I'm leavin' with you
& if you want 3 I'm freakin' with you
Benzino smashed bootee more than a few
Ha, ha ha

Verse 3: G-Dep
Yeah, yeah, yeah, aiyyo 8 classes
Champagne glasses
Vip passes
Lettin' in all the asses
Got move fastest
Cheek to cheek
Move from freak to freak
Speak the greek
Shorty went to sleep physic
Lots of stylin'
The way you move I can tell you got some talent
Intelligent & she fuckin' with seniors
I need brains & you probably a genius
Bein' the Bad Boy you know I be
It's all ages you ain't gotta show id
Too young as a man in China
So what if she can buy great boots with her loose vagina
Forget it's ors
I take it to court
Catch me on the dance floor tailgatin' a broad
I don't care if she bein' a cutie
Ask fruitie
