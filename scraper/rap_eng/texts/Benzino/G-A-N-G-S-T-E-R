Uh.......Hangmen 3 (Gangsta jugga)
Uh huh (Gangsta jugga) Uh huh yo
(Gangsta jugga)

Pray on it sober, I'm just another step closer
Niggas'll ghost ya, found out these'll hurt ya
Play it frank while I lay in the Beam, let the heat roast ya
I'm moralized street solider, I thought the streets told ya
Thug slash beat composer, Nights filled wit freaks and doser
Went from rags to riches, don't fuck with snitches
My Benz keeps the baddest bitches, huggin the block
Hollow tips sluggin the Glock, hollerin "Who let the thug in the spot"
BENZINO!!!!!! (Bitches, clips, guns) Black out, inhale blow it back out (*deep breathin*)
Take shorty to the 'Tel blow her back out
And y'all motherfuckers better not act out
I go the cash route, plus bet on mash out
Burn rubber and leave you niggas assed out

(iaaaaaaaahaha iaaahahahahaa) Chief rocker, whole tribe flooded out
He don't know you better tell your man cut it out
I'm workin with a short fuse you can't put it out
Big money, big guns that's what I'm about
...Deep concentration, I'm at a level that niggas can't get to
Grab a shovel, big meat you might get through
I'm gangsta part gorilla, part pit bull
I never start a situation that I can't finish
In other words this dog means business
Trendsetter, simple and plan, the first in rap music wit a crew on his chain
Still do it for my men behind bars, LIFERS
From Wallpoles to Ricards, push Benz's befo I got my license
And I'm coming for them belts like Tyson
We vultures, street bred, king cobras
Keep focus, smoke weed, sip Coronas
Spit chorus, bitches can't ignore us
The saga ends, you can't do nothing for us
