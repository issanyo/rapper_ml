[Intro: Benzino]
Drop that shit
(Hang Man 3)
2 times, 2 times, JB
Nigga, nigga
(Hang Man 3)
Come on y'all, come on y'all

[Verse 1: Benzino]
Only nigga with the gladiolas on his arm, titanic
Nigga iceberg, cartier, rock candid
Cameras snap it, hit ya with the hammer
Invade your privacy, you're the first one going
Padded three nooses and you already know it
Red dot, pull it back, bring your face glowing
Fuck the Cris, keep the Wolf clique flowing
Keep the move going, original fly kids (that's right)
Top notch players, we do-or-die kids, what's really good?
Let's take it to another level, let's take it to the streets, take it your mom's crib (Zino, Zino)
Let's take it to the house where your babys' moms live (that's right)
Don't stop till his dicks in the ground, circumcise that nigga with the semi four pound (c'mon c'mon) (braaa braaa)
That's how we spitting them rounds, bail out
Take my lawyer out, have a few rounds, martini
Snap a round choice of drink
Blue berry sour these, choice of stink
Pull an AC on it in your favorite throwback
Cool you off, take that, nigga hold that
You on every mixtape so I know you broke
Some kids own in every state, So I go for broke
Zino keep the heat raised for you staneless Folkes
Zino keep a mean face when I hold these notes
Come on

[Hook: Benzino]
I don’t wanna have to make yo whole team hurt
And I wanna have to put yo ass in the dirt
And I don’t wanna have to cock, shoot, and kill
But don’t get it twisted Motherfucker cause I will
And I don’t wanna chase ya ass for my loot
And I don’t wanna have to put your ass in a suit
And I don’t wanna have to kill your whole clan
But don't get it twisted motherfucker cause I can

[Verse 2: Benzino]
Watch yourself, easy now young scrapper
Don’t you forget I’m no ordinary rapper
Dangerous, no political ties, the rich-and-famous hate me, I don't holler with fire
Only ride double three, won’t sit in the five
D12 make it happen, catch me if you can
You see the gun clappin’, I’m the demolition man
Make you flip your car, ride 180 on the three
Doin’ figure eights while your lady’s callin’ me
She got a figure eight, she won’t stop callin’ me
Took her on a date, now she wanna be with me
It’s just the life of a gangster, I love it, live it, breathe it, sleep it, bleed it
Tote weed everyday cause I need it
Please believe it, don’t get me heated
I make you burn like my name was ‘Ether’
Half you niggas can’t shoot straight anyway
You no threat, you on the same block everyday
You do the runnin’ man when you hear the Glocks spray
Got my gun in hand when I have a hard day
The only ‘M&M’ I know is Made Men
By the way, he ain’t never gone play me
Show this bitch what it really is to be Shady
I don’t care how much records you sold
You can’t walk through the hood without the Men in Black
You disrespect your moms’ bitch, you deserve a smack
It’s not a black and white thing, that shit’s in the past
I got some white boys from Boston that’ll bust your ass, nigga

I don’t wanna have to make yo whole team hurt

And I don’t wanna chase ya ass for my loot
And I don’t wanna have to put your ass in a suit
And I don’t wanna have to kill your whole clan
But don't get it twisted motherfucker cause I can
