[Intro: Sample]
The day of redemption is at hand. Repent! And thou shall be saved

[Hook 1]
Suffa, Pressure puttin' rappers out to pension
It's judgement day and there shall be no redemption
Suffa, Pressure puttin' rappers out to pension
It's judgement day and there's no redemption

[Verse 1: Pressure]
For those that speak my name when they mention
All the lies that build the tension, I'll be on my comprehension
Tell me what's a rep if you ain't got respect
From crews that get a lotta sweat against the odds you bet you better watch your step
The spot is wrecked when you nod your neck
'Cause Hilltop Hoods the bomb and check iron on a thread, still some wanna step
My rod is wet, boy you're hot and wet lips, you’re humming on the [?]
So stand back, we’re coming running, speech
With drumming beats, while some are playing for my name
So the renegade hoods and the panels to your fun train
That’s just one name, traded some fame for dignity
Your words are hitting me, and your cover show's bitten, see
So lyrically you's aren’t adequate, we got the mad shit
Your crew's weak and stand on loose feet, so you had to slip
As bad as it gets [?] recognise
That MCs are stressing while the coppers arresting guys
The lesson lies in who got your back and if [?]
That's as bad as if he hung himself after female genetalia
Forever holler, keys to lovers' persist
Must be seized and in danger but we cease to exist
That's why I'm saying "fuck youse" to those who could've signed us
But we had to give reminders like you had Alzheimer's
The code of the urban streets is logic so I'm treating words
Just like a culture with a verb, punk there's no redemption

[Hook 2]
Suffa, Pressure puttin' rappers out to pension
It's judgement day and there shall be no redemption
Suffa, Pressure puttin' rappers out to pension
It's judgement day and there shall be no redemption
Suffa, Pressure puttin' rappers out to pension
It's judgement day and there shall be no redemption
Suffa, Pressure puttin' rappers out to pension
It's judgement day and there shall be no redemption

[Interlude: Sample]
Don't ever, ever fuck with me. Don't ever lie to me, disrespect me, underestimate me. If you do, your life becomes a raging sea

[Verse 2: Suffa]
My style is forever like it's frozen cryogenics
Suffa MC [?] genetic
[?] where I collect all the props, I should probably share more
I scare more rappers than DJ's fear arthritis
But I make emcees shut up like they had laryngitis
[?] me like [?] female
The tightest, [?] on the internet, check your email
Detail is what you left out left out like the fat kid in gym?
[?] 'man this shit is thin'
Walk the fine line between repeating and innovating
[?] verbally dick-beating, lyrically masturbating
Masturbating in the public arena's a battle right
[?] you couldn't get live with a satellite
Misdemeanour from the misunderstood
And mysterious hood that even gets Vulcans excited [?]
You've been sleeping on me like I was rapping under your mattress
Come at ya's, get you open like a porno actress
The fact is you're factless [?]
[?] rappers
[?] contradiction
[?]
[?] can I kick it?
That's a rhetorical question
Ingestion of the style makes you dizzy like Petroleum
[?]

[Hook 2]
Suffa, Pressure puttin' rappers out to pension
It's judgement day and there shall be no redemption
Suffa, Pressure puttin' rappers out to pension
It's judgement day and there shall be no redemption

[Interlude: Sample]
Don't ever, ever fuck with me. Don't ever lie to me, disrespect me, underestimate me. If you do, your life becomes a raging sea

[Interlude 2/Outro: Sample]
But come to me like a man, with your eyes open, head up, hand out... then I become more than a friend, more than a
Shoulder.  I become the expediter of your dreams
