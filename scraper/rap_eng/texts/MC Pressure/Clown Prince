[Intro: Suffa & Pressure]
Oi, P, it's your round
Nah, it's your round
Oi, it's your fucking round, man, I got the last fucking round!
Hey, you still owe me five anyway, bro! You get the round!
Fuck, it's your round, dude

[Hook: Pressure & Suffa]
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop, we've been down since
Back in the days, I'm the clown prince
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop, we've been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager

[Verse 1: Suffa]
Uh, first up, on the dolcet tones of the Gravy Bone Project
Suffa MC came to take you home
I drip lyrics like spits, spit lyrics like drips
In the arms, I'll lick your spirit with my miracle whip
Whip, 'cause what I'm hearing's all shit on the lyrical tip
Nah, I ain't feeling ya, kid, we gave you
Something to jock, but it wasn't no thing
Like Bobby gave Whitney a rock but it wasn't no ring
(Thanks, Bobby!)
And I'ma keep at 'em, crossing my fingers that eve
Says keep Adam, I'm going down on the weeds
And I'm a wreak havoc, little man with a big pen
I got dirty habits like a nun in a pig pen
Like drinking, smoking, cursing, sucking
Titties representing the city that I grew up in
We laid the path so you got a way in
It's Hilltop; we're three stars like a Holiday Inn

[Hook: Pressure & Suffa]
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop, we've been down since
Back in the days, I'm the clown prince
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop, we've been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager

[Verse 2: Pressure]
Next up, when I get loose with no fail
Appealing like the naked truth and the truth is for sale
So when I leave, yo, you’re fucking with my pride
I don’t see though
Typical MC, my nuts don’t match the size of my ego
I seize an opportunity 'cause they don’t linger
The glass ain't half-empty, it's half-full
That's why I'm a table drinker
Think you're on Pressure's level? Only thing tight, bro
That you might show is dressed in several of your wife's clothes
An arrogant fucker damaging suckers masterfully
If I married your mother you still wouldn’t be half of me
You should run from me, fuck battling, ain't nothing sweet
'Cause I won’t beat you to the punch, I’ll punch you to the beat
Don’t get offended by the rubbish that we pump in the street
My foot's always in my mouth, I just can't stomach defeat
I'ma master these until it's hard to breathe
It's Hilltop, we're the first to come, last to leave

[Hook: Pressure & Suffa]
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop, we've been down since
Back in the days, I'm the clown prince
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop, we've been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager

[Verse 3: Suffa & Pressure]
Man, I'm smooth like Marlon Brando at thirty
At my peak like Marlon Brando at fifty
And I'm fat like Marlon Brando at seventy
Fuck it; no MC could ever better me (No one, man)
And half the time, half my crew could drink the bar
And half these cats ain't half of what they think they are
We independent, I'd sign on the line
The day me giving you the finger is a sign of the times
Man, their rhymes are designed to try diss us, but why diss us?
I don't rewind to try to find disses
Man, I just recline and mind my business
And I think in lines in rhymes, the rhyme stitches
Up the minds of the lines of dimes and fine...
I pen letters that kill (Hey, what the fuck?)
They stab ya neck with a feather until you've bled in my quill
This veteran's ill, thinking you can better my skill
You need medicine, chill, a Pressure vendetta's for real

[Hook: Pressure & Suffa]
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop, we've been down since
Back in the days, I'm the clown prince
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop, we've been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager
