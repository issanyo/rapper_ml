[Intro: Sample]
Ladies and gentlemen
This is a public service announcement brought to you in part by the good folks at Go Fuck Yourself

[Verse 1: Sesta]
I'm a fuck up, but shut up, so you can't tell
Without spellcheck put on I can't spell
I miss calls, don't call back
I miss flights, I'm uptight, like zipties
And buy my pepties from the bombers
Got locked into a phone scam so bad
The repayments that I make had their own plan
Man at least my music don't sound like a cokehead
Well maybe that's why you're fuckin' broke (man)
I rocked up to the drug bust and figured I would get off
Cause I wasn't drugged but was a little drunk (ah)
(Please sir step out of the vehicle)
I'm sorry officer right now that is difficult
I'll throw a caution to the wind like I'm Magic Johnson's Johnson
But never got better, got hot, left on the hot sweater
If there's a bigger fuck up I have not met 'em

[Hook]
See I am a fuck up
I am a fuck up
See I am a let down
I am a let down
See I'm below average
I'm below average
See I'm below average
I'm below average
See I'm below average

[Verse 2: Trials]
And this recording, used to be a klepto
Now I'm taking something for it
I'm hopeless, both hands deep in explosives
So when I check in I reckon, they can't smell the resin
Deep on my breathe and leavin' em guessin
How many planks I got left in a full deck and
Not many cards left in a full deck
They call me a fuck up, I call bullshit
Called in sick, didn't give them the truth
Roll a long spliff like a digeridoo - don't
Think I got a lot to lose friend
If you're off your head then I'm off the roof man
I smoke weed to Wu-Tang
Enjoy it, employment, and gettin' the balls like clairvoyance
A dickhead done proper
I just wanna make ends meet like [?]

[Hook: Sesta]
See I am a fuck up
I am a fuck up
See I am a let down
I am a let down
See I'm below average
I'm below average
See I'm below average
I'm below average

[Bridge: Sesta]
I don't know if I was born this way
But it's too late to change, fuck you
And if you fuck with me
Well then I'll punch you in the face

[Verse 3: Hons]
I'm a dropkick deadbeat, no-one to envy
Still the same old Hons just dropped the Sketchy
Part from my name, but the artist the same
My bank balance still lookin' like it's damn rent week
Deadbeat Hero like a Stanhope special
Hoping I was a stand up guy if I met you
But if I was though probably hit the Bottle-O
Sometimes can't hold my liquor, like the bottle broke
(Go home Hons you're drunk)
Nah that's no fun, unless I go beat up my printer till I
Now I'm in a cab legless
Tryna do a runner at the other end but my hands can't jump fences
Idiot, sometimes dumb as Billy Madison
Tryna give a speech to incoherent ramblin'
You are all now dumber for listenin'
Back to the chorus now, let me hear ya sing

[Hook: Sesta]
See I am a fuck up
I am a fuck up
See I am a let down
I am a let down
See I'm below average
I'm below average
See I'm below average
I'm below average

[Verse 4: Pressure]
Another P-Mix, cut the beatniks
Make room for a fuckup like no other, P is
A little dysfunctional, can't get it up
Unless a midget in a carnival, a stripper as a constable
Has a paddle, impersonating adults
I'm that old, but somebody needs to get an adult
Animal on a binge in the cringe, like Hannibal
Ain't happy with the skin that I’m in
So ice cold, having lows of Azaria
It was a dingo that stole Iggy’s ARIA
Done with polite like once bitten, twice shy
Couldn't grasp, coming last, punch Mr. Nice Guy
Probably have more than two-fifths of my brain
If I wasn't too busy playing video games
You say deranged, you're too late to change
Just tryna make ends meet like a daisy chain

[Hook: Sesta]
See I am a fuck up
I am a fuck up
See I am a let down
I am a let down
See I'm below average
I'm below average
See I'm below average
I'm below average

[Outro: Suffa (Pressure)]
Man you guys have some self-esteem issues
Say it with me
I'm above average
(I'm below average)
P if you’re not gonna try you can go fuck yourself for real
(I'm below average)
