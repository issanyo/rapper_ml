[Intro:]
One, two, three, four
One, two, walk way now

[Verse 1: Pressure]
Now you’re gone, life moves on without you
You always wanted me to write a song about you
Where to begin? I caught her in a fling
They’ve been asking where you’ve been so I thought I’d fill them in
See there’s nothing that I wouldn’t put past you
When she got a lot of men that’s the harsh truth
You find the truth hard to swallow? Gotta ask you
Kind regards I’ve been doing well these past few
She’s a master with plans and a terrible feud
Leaving scars on a man if she’s ever pursued
Even after you’re damned and aware of the wound
Your beating heart's in her hand like the ‘Temple of Doom’
She’s a beast in disguise of a sweet song siren
That feasts on admirers so keep on driving
Unleashed like the virus, Khaleesi, we’re blinded
And weak so she think she can keep on lying?
Enough is enough it's just counter productive
When trust is inductive to being so fucked with
And love is a high you can buy in a substance
Know what? Fuck this, it was always destructive
I’m a let you know, I’ve yet you go
You’ll never affect my mode get dressed and go
You better test the road so step and know
You're left alone to be another stepping stone, it goes

[Hook:]
You were [?] out in the cold
You were [?] out in the cold
But I won't cry, I won't get a [?]
But I won't cry, I won't get a [?]

[Verse 2: Suffa]
She slept on the couch for about four days or so
Then left like a southpaw, bout four days ago
I’m blessed with a mouth than can outtalk ASIO
But from this fallout my poor mouth couldn’t save me so
Now I spend my days alone, playing me some Maseo
Telephone messages; I doubt she ever plays ‘em though
CD on the stereo, TV on the radio
I was a lover, but the love it couldn’t save me though
Baby don’t play me, don’t break me, yo save me
Don’t make me go crazy, like saying don’t taze me bro
Maybe you’re right, and it’s all for the best
And maybe you’re right, but I’m all you’ll have left
When the best friends head for the S bend
Less than zero, you’ll need me like a western hero
You used to use my chest as a pillow, paro
Now my heart is just a target for an arrow

[Hook:]
You were [?] out in the cold
You were [?] out in the cold
But I won't cry, I won't get a [?]
But I won't cry, I won't get a [?]

[Verse 3: Suffa]
Every breath you take is filling the
Lungs that hug the heart that’s killing me
Feelings Suffa foster for her
Lost her, not my lover, Billy Jean
So pretty please, to a girl so pretty, please
You really need to not make me crawl like a millipede
Are you feeling the fool? Maybe you’re not fulfilling me
But silly me, I’m feeling this Philly’s all I really need like

[Hook:]
You were [?] out in the cold
You were [?] out in the cold
But I won't cry, I won't get a [?]
But I won't cry, I won't get a [?]

[Outro:]
Good bye, bon voyage
Have a good journey
You understand
Now you can't - now you can't [?]
Bon voyage, sayonara
Now I'm outta here
You understand
Now you can't [?]
