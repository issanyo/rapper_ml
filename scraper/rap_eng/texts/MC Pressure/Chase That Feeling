[Verse 1: Pressure]
She’s young, lithe and homely, wise by no means
Known one guy, she's for his eyes and only
He's a lying phoney, leaves crying, lonely
Separates the pain by staying high and though she
Might just O.D., high price to go free
This ain't living, listen, it's dying slowly
(It's got a hold on me) She can chase that feeling
(It's got a hold on me) Don’t chase that feeling like

[Hook (Sampled)]
I've been looking for
A thing that's good for the rich
Yeah, the blind and the poor
Things that I've, been looking for
A thing that's good for the rich
Yeah, the blind and the poor

[Verse 2: Pressure]
Sometimes I feel we strive for a life of apathy
Callous deeds, other mindless acts of greed
Ain't jack for free, I think they'd try a tax to breathe
It’s like we fight to remind us that we bleed
I take flight in the night from lack of sleep
'Cause peace of mind's the only time that we’re free
(It's got a hold on me) And I’ma chase that feeling
(It's got a hold on me) We all chase that feeling

[Verse 3: Suffa]
It’s like they try to build you up to watch it all collapse
You try climb out the pit, they’ll try claw you back
Like back in the factory packing the shelves
It was hell 'cause the foreman was always harassing me
Like, "How’s your little old music thing going?"
Now I’m like, "How’s your bitter old loser shit going?"
And I’m right (It's got a hold on me), and I’ma chase that feeling
(It's got a hold on me) I’ma chase that feeling like

[Hook (Sampled)]
I've been looking for
A thing that's good for the rich
Yeah, the blind and the poor
Things that I've, been looking for
A thing that's good for the rich
Yeah, the blind and the poor

[Collision: Pressure & Suffa]
And I'ma chase that feeling
Take that pain and replace that feeling
And I’m a take that healing then
Stand so tall they’ll have to raise that ceiling, man

[Verse 4: Pressure]
From a young age I was making my mark, chasing my start
Forever ain't enough when you're state of the art
Fuck the haters that had said I’d never make it this far
It’s the pavers that I’d tread to dedicate to my craft
I’ve tailored every thread to bear the shape of my heart
Treating every breath as my first and day as my last
(It's got a hold on me) I still chase that feeling
(It's got a hold on me) Yeah, I still chase that feeling

[Verse 5: Suffa]
I ride the rails of a vinyl track
Fall into a trance and there ain't no climbing back
Sit and lose myself in all the hidden loops
They're like forbidden fruits, I'm like, "Can I get a bite of that?"
Gin and juice, I get loose and I write a track
Shivers down my spine, feeling more like a spinal tap
(It’s got a hold on me) And I’ma chase that feeling
(It’s got a hold on me) I'ma chase that feeling like

[Hook (Sampled)]
I've been looking for
A thing that's good for the rich
Yeah, the blind and the poor
Things that I've, been looking for
A thing that's good for the rich
Yeah, the blind and the poor

[Collision: Pressure & Suffa]
And I'ma chase that feeling
Take that pain and replace that feeling
And I’m a take that healing then
Stand so tall they’ll have to raise that ceiling, man

[Verse 6/Outro: Suffa]
At the start of the summer
I'ma come to life and have the heart of a hummingbird
And I can hear the drummer
She’s so ugly but I’m so in love with her
(Wake up) Roll out of bed, throw on some roll-on
Roll up to the studio
It’s got (Hold on me)
And I'ma chase that feeling
Chase that feeling
