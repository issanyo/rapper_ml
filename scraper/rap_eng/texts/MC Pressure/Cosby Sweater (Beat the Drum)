[Intro: Pressure & Suffa]
Watch me do my thing, get
Lost into my scene, yeah
Hot like New Orleans in
Cosby crew and jeans, yeah

[Verse 1: Pressure]
They’re not awakened, stare a lot and vacant
Living in conditions of the modern matrix
Only bare arms when I’m proper naked
Only point I made with a bullet was on paper
Ain’t here to fight some dude or fuck around with his spouse
Rather light your mood and burn it down with the house
Till your hype from the groove on account of the bounce
And looking like Tom Cruise, up and down on a couch
Status never mattered ever, act however
Like Christine Aguilera, just let yourself go
Mad at Pressure, an endeavour that is better left
Pristine track and record to let you all know
That we would be Kings even homeless
Building these kingdoms our own just
Slap a rapper like Solange Knowles
Till they’re gathering they no longer matter like a black hole

[Pre-Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
(One, two, three, come on!)
I feel like Bobby Fischer
Always four moves ahead of
My competition listen
They ain’t gonna stop me ever
I feel as large as Biggie
Swear it could not get better
I feel in charge like Biggie
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater

[Verse 2: Suffa]
I'ma step up every chance when I rumble
They all call me champ of the jungle, it’s fitting
I'ma get drunk and dance like your uncle
Till I’m all hands like your uncle, I’m kidding
The venomous inventor, when I enter then it's over
When I’m spitting venom I’m as generous as Oprah
You get a scar, you get a scar, you get a scar
Me? Drunk in the back of a rental car
Pat Benatar brah, love’s a battlefield
Here to get you out your seat like a battle drill
I’m in the saddle still, a little saddle sore
Smash you out the stratosphere, flashy as a matador
When I’m dressed like Theo’s dad
In a Coogi listening to Kool G Rap
I won’t beat around the bush like a seventies porn
I’ll make you wish that you’d never been born and it’s all good

[Pre-Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
(One, two, three, come on!)
I feel like Bobby Fischer
Always four moves ahead of
My competition listen
They ain’t gonna stop me ever
I feel as large as Biggie
Swear it could not get better
I feel in charge like Biggie
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater

[Verse 3: Pressure & Suffa]
Take a ride on the wild side of this alley
We can fire up the night like Prince Harry
Fuck the high life, we can vibe like
We got white lines hanging from behind like we’re just married
I’ll turn the art form into a blood sport
And make pea soup out of a pea-brain
They wanna run these streets like parkour?
I’d rather run these tracks like a steam train
(Like a steam train, like a steam train, like a steam train)

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
(One, two, three, come on!)
I feel like Bobby Fischer
Always four moves ahead of
My competition listen
They ain’t gonna stop me ever
I feel as large as Biggie
Swear it could not get better
I feel in charge like Biggie
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater

[Verse 4: Illy]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, we do this
Real B.I.G. [?]
Fine line between love and hate, but me, I'm cool on a tightrope (Lill it)
Mainstream [?]
Knock down doors like the Hoods performing, so
How do I put this, shorty?
Goddamn Triple J, looking good for forty
Celebration [?]
[?]
So, what up boys? Give us a cheer
And save the Taylor Swift [?]
What better way to ruin a party
Dickheads talking Illuminati
[?]
Shit, now I said too much, Solo, what up?

[Verse 5: Solo]
And it can’t stop ,won’t stop (why not?)
Some are faker than botox (my god)
Forgive 'em for they know not what they do
But with no nonsense I step to the soapbox and
Drive a tow truck through your roadblock
Might blow up, but it won't go pop
Ain’t a soap opera
Still we do it up so proper like big poppa did
Can’t stop the kid I got a gift just like that day in December
The main contender, baby say you’ll remember
Hey big spender, pair of kicks to match my favourite sweater
All dressed up with nowhere to go except maybe a bender
Draphto

[Verse 6: Drapht]
Sydney, what the fuck is up?
You gots to get down
And you wanna know something else?
It's Mr. D-rapht in the house
I'm feeling large
Feel the love, the buzz, the boom, the bap
The fact that we up here with the Hoods
One for the books
My brother from another mother
Mr. Suffa what's good?
The other day had the cops tryna bust me
(Why?) 'Cause I said "Fuck Bill Cosby"
(Fuck Bill Cosby!) Cost me my freedom
Cut off his sausage as soon as you see him
Even on Beat of The Drum
[?] machine gun, bam
We keep on beating the drum
Sydney will you sing along with us?

[Chorus: Pressure, Suffa, Illy, Solo & Drapht]
I feel like Bobby Fischer
Always four moves ahead of
My competition listen
They ain’t gonna stop me ever
I feel as large as Biggie
Swear it could not get better
I feel in charge like Biggie
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater

[Verse 7: Seth Sentry]
Ayy
I only write raps when I'm bored as hell
And I got a dope beat and a quarter ounce
[?] tortoise shell glasses
Then I'm turnin' up my motherfuckin' Walkman loud (You bastard)
I just wanna walk around
Find other MCs and sort 'em out
Yo, last time I did, man, I almost drowned
'Cause I'm so watered down I should've brought a towel
I feel like Bobby Fischer
Personally I play lots of Twister
Where's your girl? [?] kids up
After school but I ain't ever lost against her
I didn't get what I want for Christmas
All I wanted was a Cosby Sweater
'Cause I still only ever wear hand-me-downs
And all I got is an older sister

[Verse 8: Tkay Maidza]
I don't ask 'em where to get it 'cause they calling my name
Riding in a SUV, because I roll in the game
Times and times it was so empty, now I’m feeling kinda heavy
Tell them you can come and get but I ain't talking to them
You’re riding with a bunch a killers I don't rate them
Fellas taking up them leaves, but I just rake them
Tell me bout your other chick again and that one time
I will reach that Christian psycho, I might take hemp in different lanes
But they think were the same
Invest in my dreams and they watch in that lane
Beginning to sweat, if they jacking my game
Niggas wanna be me so much it is insane
You could get your man pants get in with that man dance
Niggas wanna get in, but don't have that status
I get in with that cosby sweater got no fat chance
'Cause I just cover that seat like I got a fat ass

[Chorus: Pressure, Suffa, Illy, Solo, Drapht, Seth Sentry & Tkay Maidza]
I feel like Bobby Fischer
Always four moves ahead of
My competition listen
They ain’t gonna stop me ever
I feel as large as Biggie
Swear it could not get better
I feel in charge like Biggie
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater

[Verse 9: Jeswon]
For the toad, hit the road for a couple of months
What you know 'bout the funk flow, givin' it up?
For Hilltops, Thundamentalists, chillin' the cup
Till it's showtime, blow minds, cities get crushed
They get hit with this blunt, I'm refined as a caveman
Blazin' on Adrian's vape pen, they say
That I'm baked in the brainstems, statements I spray
Are deranged as a baby gettin' raised in the basement
Full Fritzl, I got a few issues
Force-feed a vegetarian two schnitzels
Sit back and diss 'em cause I'm comfortable
In my skin, we close-nit like the Huxtables
And I think like, whatever happened to Rudy?
Is she broke on a stripper pole, clappin' her booty?
Rappers are bougie, sellin' pop records to kids
Got the nerve to act offended when I tell them that they didn't go in?
Shit, let the truth be told
I represent lost youth, call me Rufio
Do the show then we party like some maniacs
Bags packed, next day, another plane to catch

[Verse 10: Tuka]
Should've seen me coming, turned to three-hundred
When I bust in and fire away
Mind the flames as I ignite the blaze
May the bridges I burn light the way
I'm just tryna get cool, blame it on the passion
In fact blame it on the fashion
Picture me listenin' to Biggie in a skivvy and some skinny jeans
Trendy motherfucka but the ladies say I'm dashin'
As it happens, I'ma smash in the door
Made a short straw and trade it for a napkin
Wipe the slate clean, never would have, I imagine
Openin' the stage for the A-Team
Get a kraken, proper madness
G-E runnin' that shit, we be
On the Thunda Cat flips, so I'ma chase that feelin'
While the Hilltop Hoods drop a classic

[Pre-Chorus: Pressure, Suffa, Illy, Solo, Drapht, Seth Sentry, Tkay Maidza, Jeswon & Tuka]
Sydney
Sydney
Sydney
Sydney

[Chorus: Pressure, Suffa, Illy, Solo, Drapht, Seth Sentry, Tkay Maidza, Jeswon & Tuka]
(One, two, three, come on!)
I feel like Bobby Fischer
Always four moves ahead of
My competition listen
They ain’t gonna stop me ever
I feel as large as Biggie
Swear it could not get better
I feel in charge like Biggie
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
(One, two, three, four)
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
(One, two, three, four)
Wearing that Cosby Sweater

[Outro: Suffa]
Ladies and gentlemen, please make some noise for Illy, Horrorshow, Drapht, Seth Sentry, Tkay Maidza, and Thundamentals!
