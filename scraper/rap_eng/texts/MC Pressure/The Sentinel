[Intro (Sampled)]
"Behold, I send you out as sheep, amidst the wolves"
"Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba"

[Verse 1: Suffa]
We found this club on a side street, but I was kind of iffy
We could hear some fly beats, but from outside it looked shifty
I said this to Pressure, just before I finished my sentence
This bouncer came out and dragged us both through the entrance
This guy was huge and I was stumbling with my speech
I finally mumbled that we just stumbled in from the street
He said to us, "So finding us was accidental?
Well, I'm not surprised, we don't advertise at The Sentinel"
He said, "What's your name?" he said, "Pressure", I said, "Suffa"
He said, "Join the rest of the suckers"
So we went right in, we sat right down
Pressure said, "I guess I'll get us both our first round"
He had to go downstairs 'cause the bar was underground
He came back and said, "Man, these the cheapest drinks in town"
I agreed, yes indeed, we could be here all night
They're only charging a buck fifty for imperial pints
And I'm feeling all right, this place is kind of cool, man
I'm hoping tonight nobody acts a fool and
Ruins this vibe that I got going, not knowin'
Where I am, but this jam's growin', man, this spot's blowin'!
The ladies were hot, I sat down and listened
To their four thousand watt in-house sound system
The DJ was laying tracks, keeping people on the floor and then
He played a crazy break, and the chorus went

[Chorus]
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Hop right in, sit right down"
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Join the rest of the suckers" At the Sentinel
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Hop right in, sit right down"
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Join the rest of the suckers" At the Sentinel
"Ba ba ba ba ba"
"Ba ba ba ba ba" "[?]"
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Hop right in, sit right down"
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Join the rest of the suckers"

[Verse 2: Pressure]
These dim lights hold, silhouetted figures fit in tight moulds
This beer's ice cold, yeah, we gon' be here till the night's old
I might stroll, see what I can plunder, but I wonder
'Do I feel a blunder or is that the drink putting me under?'
A strange feelin', this place got my brain reelin'
Looked up and seen a picture of the barkeep upon the main ceilin'
Feel like a broken dream, I'm walking through a smoke machine
And in the corner seen a dope fiend blowin' a smoke screen
Sat down, looked at the picture on the bottle label
It was the same man and the stripper that sat atop my table
And as he licked her thighs I saw that glint in her eyes
The wristwatch upon her waistlet had him hypnotised
Then she kissed him goodbye, threw me a smile and a grin
My reply cut thin by my hand wiping my chin
Walked to the bar as the tender looked right through me, I said "Excuse me"
Then he replied in tones as if he talked about me not to me
Said, "Welcome to The Sentinel, I hope your stay here's perpetual
We serve drinks and broken dreams, but no edibles"
I bought a round, man, I think it's watered down
It's tastin' sort of foul, this place is giving me the creeps and plus the doors are now
Closing to the public, so let's make our move
Then I was struck by the strangest sense of déjà vu
Man, I swore I was bent, "Suffa, man, I've heard this all before it went
'Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba'", and then the chorus went

[Chorus]
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Hop right in, sit right down"
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Join the rest of the suckers" At the Sentinel
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Hop right in, sit right down"
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Join the rest of the suckers" At the Sentinel
"Ba ba ba ba ba"
"Ba ba ba ba ba" "[?]"
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Hop right in, sit right down"
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Join the rest of the suckers"

[Verse 3: Pressure & Suffa]
Man, this place has got me reelin', I took a seat to get my focus
When a group of B-Boys gathered by a stage took my notice
At about one o'clock the club manager approached us
And said, "I heard you jokers were MCs, who's the dopest?
'Cause we run an open mic battle every night
And to enter you gotta be incredibly tight"
I said, "Get me the mic I might flip", then the lights switched
My vision was blurrin' and burnin' words inside my eyelids
Rhyme progression begun, somethin' possessin' my tongue
Blessin' the deaf and dumb till I was fallin' short of breath in my lung
"When will they let us stop?" I checked the time and it was
Six in the morning, and we were still rhymin'
We battled MC after MC, battled MCs for days
But they wouldn't let us go when we tried to leave the stage
The manager said, "You boys can never leave this tournament
And you can never leave the Sentinel", and the chorus went

[Chorus (Extended)]
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Hop right in, sit right down"
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Join the rest of the suckers" At the Sentinel
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Hop right in, sit right down"
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Join the rest of the suckers" At the Sentinel
"Ba ba ba ba ba"
"Ba ba ba ba ba" "[?]"
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Hop right in, sit right down"
(Ba ba ba ba ba) "Join the rest of the suckers"
Ba ba ba ba ba "Hop right in, sit right down"
Ba ba ba ba ba "Join the rest of the suckers" At the Sentinel
Ba ba ba ba ba "Hop right in, sit right down"
Ba ba ba ba ba "Join the rest of the suckers" At the Sentinel

[Outro (Sampled)]
"Ba ba ba ba ba"
"Ba ba ba ba ba"
"Ba ba ba ba ba"
"Ba ba ba ba ba"
