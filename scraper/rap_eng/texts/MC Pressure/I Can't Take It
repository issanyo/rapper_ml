[Hook: Sample (Suffa)]
I tried so hard to live my life
With these kinda people around me
With these kinda people around me
My friends just tell me to keep my head high
Oh don't you worry
Tell me people, I just gotta know
I can't take it, can't take it no more
Tell me people, I just gotta know (Check it out)
I can't take it, (Come on) can't take it no more (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Suffa]
Man I feel this pain and I realise the game ain't shit
'Cause I've signed these kids arms where they've tried to drain their wrists
And that's as deep as it gets son
Deeper than an old drunk beating his step son
Now how you going to mess with the loved ones? Wanna beat em'?
It's like this demon wanted kids just to mistreat 'em
As street preachers scream at the heathens
Man we've been caught up in a net like sea creatures
Free speech is speechless we just don't care that they took it
We just don't care that they're crooked
Corruption's like cocaine and everybody's just so high
And they're all so good looking
Man fuck that
That kid's got gravel on his knees from the ground that he grovel on
Matchstick Babylon burn it to the ground, churn it up, rip it up
(Turn it upside down, burn it up)
And grandfathers died on battlefields so we could die in toilet floors
Smack up, pass out and soil our drawers
Cut throat, blood soaks, and soils our shores
We got a war for oil that gives us oil for wars
Fuck that man cause I'm a believer I love life
I love pieces like they don't love either
My love is deeper, my brother's keeper
It's like they want to set us all now chuck the fucking ether
What?

I tried so hard to live my life

Tell me people, I just gotta know
I can't take it, can't take it no more

[Verse 2: Pressure]
Is the world made of plastic? Is the city buried in schemes?
Ain't it tragic?
Capture we rage and to lay in traffic, till it beats us into shape like a hated blacksmith
Writing blue collar change, a kid escaping notice, when the fuck we became the process
Tainted focus, straining, so stressed, pain of slow death
No!
Burn it down in the name of progress
We see, teach and grow the most lethal foe
When he kills for a reason he don't even know
While media's feeding your evening show
Like vampire's getting high on other people's lows
So while the courts are choked with matters
The only status that counts is the amount over balance
Cause credit is a loan attached to a rope and ladder
If you don't know the swagger, the cloak and dagger
Sex workers, street urchins, houses, squaller, glad the churches got merchants out, we've got 'em
Got murderous politics. Don't be absurd its gonna surface hidden by the courteous bounds of honour
And in the hope I'll cope I'll get over a flow with the dope and lines in Le Coka Nostra
And I'm focused to know where the loves at
Ya'll gotta go then it'll come back (come back...)

[Outro: Turntablism]
Tell me people, I just gotta know
I can't take it, can't take it no more
Tell me people, I just gotta know
I can't take it, can't take it no more
