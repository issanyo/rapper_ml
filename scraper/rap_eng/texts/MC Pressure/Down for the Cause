[Verse 1: Hyjak]
If someone you know sits in the room talking to the wall all day
Don’t be afraid, it probably means they went out and bought my tape
'Cause all it takes are these freshly chopped herbals
And I could rhyme in a language that translates crop circles
Controversial 'cause I contest commercial rappers
Jak is throwing bottles while they’re rolling in their convertibles
Don’t take it personal; I was born to burn you all
With words so berserk I’m forced to stay disguised like Serpico
The crime watcher, that’s right I watch crimes and laugh
And take my half of the profits after watching for cop cars
I can’t cooperate, only operate
Chase promoters for dough they owe us and take what’s in their bank

"People—people wanna see me get busy, 'cause I'm
Very, very dope and I’m freaking the funky [?]"
"People—people wanna see me get busy, 'cause I'm
Very, very dope and I’m freaking the funky [?]"

[Verse 2: Pressure]
I’m down for the cause like suicide bombers
I made a life promise, pushing underground through city night commerce
It suddenly spread through these southernly treads
I got a beautiful mind it’s just stuck in an ugly head
I’m stunning with skill while some are run of the mill
We coming real, I’m from Adelaide, one in a mill
This underground’s broke by any means, we ain’t getting cream
Sweat the scene, I’ll burn you never-beens like Oxyacetylene
The larger a fools ego the harder they fall
So I drink till I can hardly recall the party at all
I’ve had enough; while they’re acting tough I’m acting up
I don’t put emcee’s under pressure, I ain’t into all that faggot stuff
This rhyme addiction’s so bad; I’m a go mad
And stick up emcee’s for their thoughts and add ‘em to my vocab
If life’s a bitch then death’s a slut
'Cause death comes for everyone, and when it’s you turn you’re fucked

[Verse 3: Hyjak]
I think I finally lost the plot, let’s have a round of applause
I’m down for the cause; I’m moving mountains, bouncing off walls
Rip countless cordless’s, confuse counsellors, talking shit
Forced to spit from now until I’m on stage with walking sticks
Depicted a portrait of a anti-corporate kid
Scared rappers get court orders against such rawness
I’m mad for life, in the club hand me the mic
I kick one verse and get myself banned for life
If these hecklers dissing when I’m standing on stage
I’m a call you out and show the true meaning of crowd participation
Rolling down the street I just slapped the shit of a groupie
And distract store managers while I’m stealing liquor and movies
Forever broke, no job, nowhere left to go
Jerry Springer comes on and I’ve already seen the episode
That’s when you know you’re really unemployed
Brain destroyed, step in to Centrelink and you see all your fucking boys

[Verse 4: Suffa]
Emcee's claim they’re moving units, they serious? That’s not the fact though
The fact is, you couldn’t sell a burger to Fat Joe
Think your all of that (no), you’ll be falling back bro
Jack lives here, you call him Jack I call him fatso
I pack shows; slap foes like bitter defactos
Step on this mic, I’ll end your life like tobacco
My style’s more fatal than second hand medicine
I even bomb veterans; Hip Hop connects this world like Thomas Edison
Through lettering and underground peddling
I get these kids open like lungs on Ventolin
Presenting them with controversy like Jello Biafra
I’m down for the cause, protect these artists like we’re APRA
Like cats on Viagra, I could serve you all night
Call me the customer (why’s that?) 'cause I’m always right
And I’m always mad tight, like rich people with funds
And the styles more deadly than sharing needles with bums, it goes…
