Yeah, yeah. Next up, Jaytee on the ones and twos. What up!

[Verse 1: K21]
Sickly sweet man-child of misery
Swimming seas, roaming to plan my divinity
Damn fine dynasty snatch mics you little pea
Brain suckers are nothing act like you're missing me
Still I'm seeking serotonin till she's dead or moaning
Blame the pheromones, let them go, necking potion
Sent a deadly oath from here to the penny oaks
Till my message grows it ain't nothing but some Lennon folk
Same old stereo, yoda and it's ready go
Wanna hang with cutie but she playing me like MMO
Music what I let elope, rooftop, steady scope
Listen to my neighbourhood in silence and my pen implodes
Life copped the best of me, red her cheek from stubble then I
Sent her home, guess she knows my chemistry is trouble
"Can you hear me now?" I said it while they mumbled
Now the energy is double, never meant to speak it subtle

[Chorus: K21]
You don't really know me, know what?
How I ride in this street, road block
Peddle peddle I'm free, so not
Got the music pumping through my blood and it won't stop
You don't really know me, know what?
How I ride this street, road block
Peddle peddle I'm free, so not
This music pumping through my blood and it...

[Verse 2: K21]
Never feeling comfy, chaos in the jungle: Jumanji
Swimming through the sewer for my lunch meat
Then I'm feeling lovely, nothing feel above me
I can turn your autumn into summer in a heart beat
And straight back to winter, a wizard I'm "nasty"
Kick it till I'm killed in my hometown, Gaddafi
Till then the party'll getting ladi dadi'd
Face off, same spot, here till they bar me
Messed it up, messed up, a mess up from Messina
My produce the fresh stuff, plucked from the しま
K's that amigo, crazy like Cee Lo
And I ain't what your hero would look like
My alter ego bathing in charm the good Samaritan type
Single-minded civilian the track is my vice
Got a match or light? I got plans to ignite
And burn this whole city down, that's what its like

[Chorus: K21]
You don't really know me, know what?
How I ride in this street, road block
Peddle peddle I'm free, so not
Got the music pumping through my blood and it won't stop
You don't really know me, know what?
How I ride this street, road block
Peddle peddle I'm free, so not
This music pumping through my blood and it won't stop

[Ad-Lib: Pressure]
P-Mix!

[Verse 3: Pressure]
Ain't nuttin stoppin' till we hit rock fucking bottom
Or my man K21 push the button on 'em
Desperado, [?] embargo
The threat, every breathe you'll be kept precious cargo
P: force of nature (Me?) Course I hate ya
Like, "Mate can you sit on a see-saw with razors"
I put my heart in art and I fathered half of this
Bastard cast, surpassed by their master that's marvellous
Fuck the sound like, "I'm sounding like a sound bite?"
Cut a record from the gutter, brother started out like
An addict, I was underweight, mad that I was underpaid
They feed your ego but don't satisfy the hunger pains
Cash is on my mind, never close to my chest
That's why I stand with the divine in my moment of death
Till then I take what I need, not what I can get
I never break while I breath, I can stop when I'm dead, it's like

[Chorus: K21]
You don't really know me, know what?
How I ride in this street, road block
Peddle peddle I'm free, so not
Got the music pumping through my blood and it won't stop
You don't really know me, know what?
How I ride this street, road block
Peddle peddle I'm free, so not
This music pumping through my blood and it won't—
