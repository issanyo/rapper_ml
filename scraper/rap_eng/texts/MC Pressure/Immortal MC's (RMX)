[Intro: Sample]
People, we can do this

[Verse 1: Pressure & Suffa]
It's the immortal MC's, we came to build on this earth
So we blessed the microphone like priest's did children at birth
Many see microphone mastery, please keep it to heart that we
Are not masters of this art, it's simply this art that has mastered me
For those that shall come after me your rhymes just fill the holes with laughter, we
A dastardly duo, don't go starting me
And I am for real like Outkast apologies
As long as we rockin' the mic ain't no stopping me
I rock it properly, Hilltop's a property
Sometimes I feel like stress is squashing me like fat girls on top of me
Now honesty will get you everywhere and everywhere's
All over the place like your rhyme styles so you got styles from anywhere
Lest we dead or be ourselves or see ourselves as individuals
So I make tracks on digital to please myself
Fuck MC's that felt they're hard done by
Saying "Tonight's their night," I set their mic alight and have me float my sunrise

[Scratches: DJ Debris]
"Brrr, it's that [?] original"
"Let me hear it" "We can do this"
"Brrr, it's that [?] original"
"Brrr, it's that [?]" "We can do this"

[Verse 2: Suffa & Pressure]
We got the funk, we got the funk like George Clinton
MC's take an intern like interns take it from Bill Clinton
Smoke that cigar, don't take a breath, take a drag
I blow on spots like 200 proof, meth and a rag
See this is ill in the flesh like cancer live in the breast
The realest test make you party people squeal "Yes, yes"
So if MC's wanna test don't give up the fight
You need to stand up with your mic and battle all night
Alright, these MC's I'm rippin' 'em, then flippin' 'em
When it comes to mic control I got soul like Minnie Riperton
So do you wanna ride
Through the south side and Hilltops with the Certified Wise
Heard you might try but you can't battle perfection
These boys will blow your high like adrenaline injections
When we flex an even RSL diggers label us veteran
Lack direction, we put hip-hop on the map in your section

[Scratches: DJ Debris]
"Brrr, it's that [?] original"
"Let me hear it" "We can do this"
"Brrr, it's that [?] original"
"Brrr, it's that [?]" "We can do this"

[Verse 3: Suffa & Pressure]
Now how can you compete with this? Half of you are weak as piss
The weaker always need to diss, you're open like a bleeding wrist
Get focused, you ain't seeing this, we're doper than weed and trips
No peace without war, go to war to get a piece of this
They cease and miss, we're keeping on
Our rhyme styles you're sleeping on
The fuse is lit and we the bomb
See the naked truth like peeping tom's
Your styles are weak, mate, keep it strong
Your girl said she needs a long
And on and on and on she kept on...
Our style's slept on my mattresses
There's no crew that matches this
Try to play the roller, but there ain't nothing but actresses
But don't you kid the fatness is
The shit like we ate laxatives
Underground's where we're from; immortal hip-hop activists

[Scratches: DJ Debris]
"Brrr, it's that [?] original"
"Let me hear it" "We can do this"
"Brrr, it's that [?] original"
"Brrr, it's that [?]" "We can do this"
