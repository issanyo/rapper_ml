[Intro: Pressure]
When life gives you lemons
Squirt a little bit up in your eye duct
Feeling salty? Put one
Finger on nose and hit it lined up
Choke back those feelings, you and I
Know that shit's real, it's do or die
Toast that till you feel the roof afire
Throw back, it's tequila suicide

[Verse 1: Suffa]
You got lemon in your eyeball
Sodium chloride up in your nose, but
One hand upon the Bible
I swear this is how you and I can get over
So pass tequila like a dutchie, feeling like you're lucky
We can play Tequila Roulette
Load six shots (one worm) feelin' like
You're hungry (eyes closed) pick shots (do it)
You're so down on yourself, can't get it hard
And the only thing of interest's your credit card
Better half's looking at the front door and
You're stalking their socials to see who they're talking
To, don't be salty like goat's cheese
Dude, this is unfettered, hopefully
Good advice, come get it, come close, the
Hoods don't lie, run with it, you can quote me

[Bridge: Suffa]
Is it unreasonable?
That when life gives you lemons, tequila and salt
Grab tequila and salt
Life gives you lemons, tequila and salt
Tryna live, is that unreasonable?
Life gives you lemons, tequila and salt
Check, grab tequila and salt
Life gives you lemons, tequila and salt

[Chorus 1: Suffa]
Tequila Suicide
Take the shot, snort the salt
And squirt the lemon in your eye
Tequila Suicide
Take the shot, snort the salt
And squirt the lemon in your eye

[Bridge: K21]
Is it unreasonable?
That when life gives you lemons, tequila and salt
Grab tequila and salt
Life gives you lemons, tequila and salt
Tryna live, is that unreasonable?
Life gives you lemons, tequila and salt
Grab tequila and salt
Life gives you lemons, tequila and salt

[Verse 2: K21]
You say "te amo" and I say "tequila"
Mockingbirds fly out the way when I stumble
You watch over me, then you might need a healer
Tonight it feels like Adelaide is a jungle
Turn water to wine and mezcal into diamonds
Drink tequila like it's soup of the day
Until nothing's left but a nuisance live made of myself
And decisions are usually stupid, but hey
Screw the taste and just gimme the shots
No expert but don't put that shit on the rocks
While my legs work I'ma get in the spot
And, drink till I drop, to the rim line 'em up
Skip on lemons like I'm car shoppin', but I'm
Bar-hoppin' till my hearts stoppin' and there ain't a thing I can, um...
Honestly remember the next day
'Cept yellin', "Please, one more for my neck pain?"

[Chorus 1: Pressure]
When life gives you lemons
Squirt a little bit up in your eye duct
Feeling salty? Put one
Finger on nose and hit it lined up
Choke back those feelings, you and I
Know that shit's real, it's do or die
Toast that till you feel the roof afire
Throw back, it's tequila suicide

[Verse 3: Pressure]
Ayy
I'm feelin' better now (oh) since I let it out
Forgotten the rotten along with everything I cared about
Lost a fair amount, lost my care and doubts
In a tequila until I lost my whereabouts
It happens, I'm a loner and my baddest of opponents
So I sat there like I was fathoming atonement
Tried gathering composure when I should have staggered home and
It's so sad that nothing matters but this moment... damn

[Chorus 1: Suffa]
Tequila Suicide
Take the shot, snort the salt
And squirt the lemon in your eye
Tequila Suicide
Take the shot, snort the salt
And squirt the lemon in your eye
Tequila Suicide
Take the shot, snort the salt
And squirt the lemon in your eye
Tequila Suicide
Take the shot, snort the salt
And squirt the lemon in your eye

[Bridge: K21]
Is it unreasonable?
That when life gives you lemons, tequila and salt
Grab tequila and salt
Life gives you lemons, tequila and salt
Tryna live, is that unreasonable?
Life gives you lemons, tequila and salt
Grab tequila and salt
Life gives you lemons, tequila and salt

[Chorus: Pressure]
Is it unreasonable
That when life gives you lemons, tequila and salt
Grab tequila and salt
Life gives you lemons, tequila and salt
Tryna live, is that unreasonable?
Life gives you lemons, tequila and salt
Grab tequila and salt
Life gives you lemons, tequila and salt
