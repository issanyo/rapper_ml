[Sample: Paul Heyman]
Tonight, we have a chance to say, 'Yeah, you're right. We're too wild. We're too out of control. We're too full of our own shit.' Or we have a chance to say, 'Hey, fuck you, you're wrong! Fuck you, we're right!' Because you have all made it to the dance. Cause believe me, this is the dance! Start the show!

[Chorus]
We have the thirst, we have the hunger
We dive head first into the wonder
We have the thirst, we have the hunger
We dive head first into the wonder

[Verse: Pressure]
Don't know how I got here, don't know what approachin'
Don't know when this started, don't know where I'm goin'
If all I know is the path that I tread
Then life's a road: it goes one foot after the next
So I headed away the day my third was born
Feelin' blessed that I waited and made your first of dawns
It's like a Soap Opera tourin' through this snow, fog and morning
And we don't stop performin' till Debris lost an organ
And maybe I'm a dreamer but what happened to us?
Going crazy, cabin fever in the back of a bus
Something changed me on that road, when you're at it for months
Felt like a stranger being home so I had to adjust
Caught some mates at an event then they made an intervention
They say I should be slowin' down, I'm gaining in momentum
Truth in admissions part of pursuing this vision
And fuck cancer, my boy made it through his remission
Celebrated life more than I had in years
We celebrated the support from our fans and peers
I celebrated when our Prime Minster lost his throne
But dirt on someone else's hands doesn't wash your own
Some are livin' for the day, I'm haunted by my last
If all before echoes like a chorus of the past
Write a story in the sky, something for us that'll last
Till we're drinking from the sun and walking under stars
