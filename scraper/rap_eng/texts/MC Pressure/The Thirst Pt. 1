[Verse: Pressure]
It’s been a while since we last touched bases
Ever since ‘State of the Art’ rushed playlists
Been around the globe a couple of times
Sang in a thousand homes but none of them mine
Played a thousand shows under the lights
And walked on mountain roads touching the sky
Rocked foreign shores where I swore I had no name
That meant more than the awards and accolades
Like I can’t believe we made our calling
We’ve barely stopped to breathe and take it all in
It’s got a hold on me the day I fold and leave
It’s gonna seem like I’m falling
And I buried two friends, lost touch with some others
Split with my girl, found love with another
For every road the world I know gets smaller
Came home to find my son had grown a head taller
