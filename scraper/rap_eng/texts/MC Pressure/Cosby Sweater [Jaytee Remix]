[Intro: Pressure]
Watch me do my thing get
Lost into my scene yeah
Hot like New Orleans in
Cosby crew and jeans yeah

[Verse 1: Pressure]
They’re not awakened, stare a lot and vacant
Living in conditions of the modern matrix
Only bare arms when I’m proper naked
Only point I made with a bullet was on paper
Ain’t here to fight some dude or fuck around with his spouse
Rather light your mood and burn it down with the house
Till your hype from the groove on account of the bounce
And looking like Tom Cruise, up and down on a couch
Status never mattered ever act however
Like Christine Aguilera just let yourself go
Mad at Pressure, an endeavour that is better left
Pristine track and record to let you all know
That we would be Kings even homeless
Building these kingdoms our own just
Slap a rapper like Solange Knowles
Till they’re gathering they no longer matter like a black hole

[Pre-Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
I feel like Bobby Fischer
Always four moves ahead of
My competition listen
They ain’t gonna stop me ever
I feel as large as Biggie
Swear it could not get better
I feel in charge like Biggie
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater

[Verse 2: Suffa]
I'ma step up every chance when I rumble
They’ll all call me champ of the jungle, it’s fitting
I'ma get drunk and dance like your uncle
Till I’m all hands like your uncle, I’m kidding
The venomous inventor when I enter then it’s over
When I’m spitting venom I’m as generous as Oprah
You get a scar, you get a scar, you get a scar
Me? Drunk in the back of a rental car
Pat Benatar brah, love’s a battlefield
Here to get you out your seat like a battle drill
I’m in the saddle still, a little saddle sore
Smash you out the stratosphere, flashy as matador
When I’m dressed like Theo’s dad
In a Coogi listening to Kool G Rap
I won’t beat around the bush like a seventies porn
I’ll make you wish that you’d never been born and it’s all good

[Pre-Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
I feel like Bobby Fischer
Always four moves ahead of
My competition listen
They ain’t gonna stop me ever
I feel as large as Biggie
Swear it could not get better
I feel in charge like Biggie
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater

[Verse 3: Pressure & Suffa]
Take a ride on the wild side of this alley
We can fire up the night like Prince Harry
Fuck the high life we can vibe like
We got white lines hanging from behind like we’re just married
I’ll turn the art form in a blood sport
And make pea soup outta of a pea brain
They wanna run these streets like parkour?
I’d rather run these tracks like a steam train

[Verse 4: K21]
I'm bringin' more of the raw that you're after
All night long, give it all for the master
Raw with the storm, I'm a martian in orbit
Like Marvin, toured it from a car, so my feet up
Leave 'em dead gone: Hasta La Vista
Italiano who got more than pasta or pizza
Hit 'em with a carton of ether, I hit it
And if she American, I'm in it for half of the green card
Golden Era where the whole squad G-up
It's a bit of a handful, no D-cup, you see us
Rippin' every speaker, leaving our enemies dust
Let 'em speak up, I'm wreckin' 'em while they mean mug
I've coffee every morning and I'm ignorin'
Every message on my phone cause it's never important
But instead I'ma morph into a Wartortle, ready for D-Day
Headed for each State on my release date

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
I feel like Bobby Fischer
Always four moves ahead of
My competition listen
They ain’t gonna stop me ever
I feel as large as Biggie
Swear it could not get better
I feel in charge like Biggie
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater

[Verse 5: Jeswon]
For the toad, hit the road for a couple of months
What you know 'bout the funk flow, givin' it up?
For Hilltops, K21 chillin' the cup
Till it's showtime, blow minds, cities get crushed
They get hit with this blunt, I'm refined as a caveman
Blazin' on Adrian's vape pen, they say
That I'm baked in the brainstems, statements I spray
Are deranged as a baby gettin' raised in the basement
Full Fritzl, I got a few issues
Force-feed a vegetarian two schnitzels
Sit back and diss 'em cause I'm comfortable
In my skin, we close-nit like the Huxtables
And I think like, whatever happened to Rudy?
Is she broke on a stripper pole, clappin' her booty?
Rappers are bougie, sellin' pop records to kids
Got the nerve to act offended when I tell them that they didn't go in?
Shit, let the truth be told
I represent lost youth, call me Rufio
Do the show then we party like some maniacs
Bags packed, next day, another plane to catch

[Verse 6: Tuka]
They would've seen me coming, turned to three-hundred
When I bust in and fire away
Mind the flames as I ignite the blaze
May the bridges I burn light the way
I'm just tryna get cool, blame it on the passion
In fact blame it on the fashion
Picture me listenin' to Biggie in a skivvy and some skinny jeans
Trendy motherfucka but the ladies say I'm dashin'
As it happens, I'ma smash in the door
Made a short straw and trade it for a napkin
Wipe the slate clean, never would have, I imagine
Openin' the stage for the A-Team
Get a kraken, proper madness
G-E runnin' that shit, we be
On the Thunda Cat flips, so I'ma chase that feelin'
While the Hilltop Hoods drop a classic
