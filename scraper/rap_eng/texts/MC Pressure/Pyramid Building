[Verse 1: Pressure]
So they say, a man can be wealthy
With no money in the bank if he’s lucky he can thank his family’s healthy
And a man can be empty, in a mansion with plenty
Of rooms, none of which he could fill with happier memories
And if just the two of us had shelter, food and love
I’d leave our debts, free of stress, content that you enough
Obsession and possession’s we’re destined to erupt
I can’t spend them where we’re heading through death and to the dust
Even so we keep it moving working through till we’re old
Truly evolved to consumers in pursuit of our goals
On a quest for improvement but we losing control
Digging for gold, hit bottom, test human resolve
We got credit, lenders, debit, vendors, savings and cheques
But only thing we spend is a life escaping the debt
You bet I’d trade it for complacence and a place I can rest
And that’s enough if I’m paid in respect

[Hook]
The more I want then the less I’m free
So when I see everything I’ve got
That’s enough for me, that’s enough for me
That’s enough for me it’s all I need
The more I want then the less I’m free
So when I see everything I’ve got
That’s enough for me, that’s enough for me
That’s enough for me it’s all I need

[Verse 2: Suffa]
You could write a cheque for a private jet
And you could fly with your private chef
But excess don’t equal success, and ain’t nothing that I respect
A billionaire could die a violent death for all I care
They’re pyramid building, while little kids
Children, are literally chilling, and I ain’t against the
White picket fence but, why must we let the wiry spectre of greed
In our lives and start vying for cheddar? Lying to debtors
Grinding but dying, and tiring of lectures
Trying to better our lives we endeavour
A sheep in the wild with the lions and leopards
And finding a shepherd to guide through the weather
And bind us together’s like trying to get to
A light in the sky, but we’re flying forever
And never getting anywhere I sigh like whatever

[Hook]
The more I want then the less I’m free
So when I see everything I’ve got
That’s enough for me, that’s enough for me
That’s enough for me it’s all I need
The more I want then the less I’m free
So when I see everything I’ve got
That’s enough for me, that’s enough for me
That’s enough for me it’s all I need

The more I want then the less I’m free
So when I see everything I’ve got
That’s enough for me, that’s enough for me
That’s enough for me it’s all I need
The more I want then the less I’m free
So when I see everything I’ve got
That’s enough for me, that’s enough for me
That’s enough for me it’s all I need
