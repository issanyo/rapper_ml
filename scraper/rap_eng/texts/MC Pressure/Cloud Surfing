[Verse 1: Reason]
We from the southern land, backpacker type of men
Wondering about the strand, and the hype of Big Ben
Man, tell my U.K brethren, I'm wishing gradually
One day I'll pay a visit to the Brixton Academy
I dream, I recall, when I was a teen
I used to feign for the places that I hadn't been
Just because being Aussie in a well played scene
Busting London, posse blade and DJ supreme
And we're generation savers, [?] sound clashes
With nations of neighbours, we play to in the ashes
Okay you have a cash-out before I depart
Hard crushing, maybe fetchy, yet a bowl for lava
So I'ma start the Reason behind this track
The old darting like cohesion, that's that
And that's a fact, 'nuff chit-chat, come tell us something
True, no bluffing, night trip to London

[Hook: Pressure]
We cloud surf through all of Earth's borders
Transcend gravity for our next performance
That's what makes my world go round
Another 48 hours till the sun goes down
We cloud surf through all of Earth's borders
Transcend gravity for our next performance
That's what makes my world go round
Another 48 hours till the sun goes down

[Verse 2: Pressure]
I rise early at midnight, to in flight
Economy class got me feeling like I hitchhiked
Making records but i'm still a fan
That's why I travel the Earth and my world weighs thirty kilograms
Blurred vision, and nerves kicking
Certainly isn't my dear luxury when it hurts sitting
Another time, another person, a place
Not claustrophobic I just hate you'll in my personal space
But check it, we do it all so the blood can connect
The love and respect we get, tearing up in a set
If getting up in a jet, can kill another regret
Then disrespect to each and every motherfucker I met
We only wait for the next cloud, and well I'm proud
I tell my sounds taking me around the world
I don't ever doubt myself, ain't that something?
Another twenty four hours from Adelaide to London, uh

[Hook: Pressure]
We cloud surf through all of Earth's borders
Transcend gravity for our next performance
That's what makes my world go round
Another 48 hours till the sun goes down
We cloud surf through all of Earth's borders
Transcend gravity for our next performance
That's what makes my world go round
Another 48 hours till the sun goes down

[Verse 3: Reason]
I'm a travelling man, from the land of the ditch
Spent my time imagining about London Bridge
Then one time, I left the Aussie sunshine
Rough landing in Heathrowe, minus the heat bro
Go for a swim, ah, cruise in the ten
Spit rap, sing music by the right of them
Just before I toast over ghost bomb beat
The most hustling by bootleggers on Bond Street
So I cussed 'em, told 'em what I'm gonna do to them
Dubbed a double decker bus to scope Wilmington (it's true)
The weather hits hard like Frank Bruno
Spent time at Greenwich Park (hurry, it's Cuzzy Stark [?])
Run and see cunts, buffer boys, Doc Martins
Chill with Kiwi Aussies at Coventry Gardens (haha)
Sport tartans, the bull be my team
I'm departing dribbly lines to school the queen

[Hook: Pressure]
We cloud surf through all of Earth's borders
Transcend gravity for our next performance
That's what makes my world go round
Another 48 hours till the sun goes down
We cloud surf through all of Earth's borders
Transcend gravity for our next performance
That's what makes my world go round
Another 48 hours till the sun goes down
