[Hook:]
I’m no good; yes I’m no good
Let me tell you no good, girl I’m no good
I’m no good for nothing
Get 'em P!

[Verse 1: Pressure]
Problematic child from a god abandoned isle
Where Hip Hop is like a convict on a standing trial
Dropping havoc I’ll rock the planet wild
Till they shoot me in a movie Hong Kong combatant style
Plastic rapping and disposable culture
Poet or solider, falter and get thrown to the vultures
We wear our scars like a badge of honour sewn in the shoulder
Cross the unknown, rock alone like the coast of Gibraltar
Looking over my shoulder, radio and payola
Keep us alien on air like being flown by Travolta
Flow with a vocal assault of the microphone and controller
Harder to handle than a loaded revolver coated with sulphur
You in a house made of glass throwing a boulder
But never see the light of day car like car motors on solar
Going for broke don’t mean you’re going broke for the culture
We’d hang ourselves given rope and pergola

[Hook:]
I’m no good; yes I’m no good
Let me tell you no good, girl I’m no good
I’m no good for nothing
And I might be no good but when I seize the mic
I can spit it like, like (Jesus Christ)
I’m no good; yes I’m no good
Let me tell you no good, girl I’m no good
I’m no good for nothing
And I might be no good but when I seize the mic
I can spit it like, like (Jesus Christ)

[Verse 2: Suffa]
Beast of burden, carry the weight
I got divorced from reality to marry the break
In a bally and cape, I get carried away
Like a cadaver on a battlefield, make barriers break
Man my chariot waits; I can’t stay for the gala
Music is dead, fames alive Lady Gaga
They complain about the drama go
Play the martyr role better than Mohammed Atta
Suffa, grimy as Calcutta
Beat you single-handed like Def Leppard’s drummer
I’m about to blow like meth on the cooker
Leaving me with mic’s like leaving pets with the butcher
Don’t put a foot wrong, think for a good long minute
(Shut your mouth) put a foot-long in it
You’re dealing with one of the best to bust so
Tyler Durden, don’t beat yourself up bro

[Hook:]
I’m no good; yes I’m no good
Let me tell you no good, girl I’m no good
I’m no good for nothing
And I might be no good but when I seize the mic
I can spit it like, like (Jesus Christ)
I’m no good; yes I’m no good
Let me tell you no good, girl I’m no good
I’m no good for nothing
And I might be no good but when I seize the mic
I can spit it like, like (Jesus Christ)

[Outro:]
I am bad bad bad
If you can feel me
They say I am no good
I am bad bad bad
If you can feel me
They say I am no good
Feelin' better
Feelin' better
Feelin' better
Feelin' better
I know
