[Verse 1: Suffa]
A gentleman caller, come to settle the bill
A veteran, stepping in with a set off incredible skills
Revitalised, heads are moving back, forth, side to side
Like bobble-head Jesus on the dashboard, I’m rhyming like
There’s dynamite inside the mic, kill the chat
I’m riding like a Silverback on a tiny bike; all right, I’m like
Awkward, dangerous, don't talk to strangers
Don’t court the brainless, don’t war with neighbours
We decent humans, no fucking about
You try speak the truth and throw up in your mouth
Lies are poison, and these cats are carriers, ad men
But I’m like Harry Allen; I’m a media assassin
I ain’t been infected by a carrier yet
Suffa’s not a puppet, fuck a marionette
Yep, so I’mma play the back of this mess
Till they start paying these rappers with reality cheques, check

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Debris]
"Life is a battle and strength is survival"
"Got it together so clever no one could sever"
"I'ma let you know" "[?]"
"Some search for better but most won't even try to"

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
If they’re lost sounding like they’re brain washed
Seeking to relieve the grind
Think what’s locked up inside of that brain box
And we can leave it all behind
Roll with me now, all with me now
We’ll ride out on this cloud
Roll with me now, hold with me now
All with me 'cause the tide is rolling out

[Verse 2: Pressure]
Another chapter from the twisted corrupt, a sinners soul in it
A pacifist but if it erupts, we in controllership
See rappers in particular attack but when I visit ya
Be acting like my dick is the grudge, been holding it
Mate it’s all been heard before, came in on your learners thought
Blazing was your way in now your sailing in a perfect storm
If albums turning gold was a murder toll
Beer, rappers and revenge, three things I’m serving cold
It’s hard to pick the reason that they’re starting shit with me when
It’s a path of risk, the partnerships like marching with a legion
The route untraveled is packed with a brutal battle and passengers
Who been gaffled with super natural vernacular
Stress is killing me, a head of red capillaries
Yet the name holds weight better than express delivery
The miracle three, but me inducted a Saint?
Hate me for what I am, don’t love for something I ain’t

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Debris]
"Life is a battle and strength is survival"
"Got it together so clever no one could sever"
"I'ma let you know" "[?]"
"Some search for better but most won't even try to"

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
If they’re lost sounding like they’re brain washed
Seeking to relieve the grind
Think what’s locked up inside of that brain box
And we can leave it all behind
Roll with me now, all with me now
We’ll ride out on this cloud
Roll with me now, hold with me now
All with me 'cause the tide is rolling out

[Verse 3: Drapht]
Who am I to be brilliant? Who am I to be murderous?
Speak for the reptilian, sort of like Steve Irwin was
Never determined by the hand like Kermit the Frog
Got hits controlling the jukebox like I’m the Fonz
I’m the bomb with it, I have the common sense
To not compete with the sheep and go beyond the fence
I need no strong defence when you bring your own league
Got the best of them out of their seat like I was Phil Jackson
While all you actors sit on the side-lines
Watching me move my magic, whole team is massive
Go go go gadget legs, went from the baddest egg
To making bread I am the alchemist, yep yep
Yo, I am not like them, I use the Tao Te Ching
A little Zen and the power within, yep yep
Moving mountains with the power of thanks
This is how with every album we’re allowed to win
So now you know

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Debris]
"Life is a battle and strength is survival"
"Got it together so clever no one could sever"
"I'ma let you know" "[?]"
"Some search for better but most won't even try to"

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
If they’re lost sounding like they’re brain washed
Seeking to relieve the grind
Think what’s locked up inside of that brain box
And we can leave it all behind
Roll with me now, all with me now
We’ll ride out on this cloud
Roll with me now, hold with me now
All with me 'cause the tide is rolling out
