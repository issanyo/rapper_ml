[Verse 1: Pressure]
This is recreation, set your station and get your place in
A comfy seat, pump this beat, Pressure will set the occasion
For your entertainment, I work hard on my flows
This scene is full of falling emcees, I wear hardhats to shows
And every Hip Hop head’s a critic, cause some hit the stage hard
But couldn’t get these arseholes open at a gay bar
It’s a comedy festival; they’re so unintelligible
Can’t work out if they got peas for brains, or they’re just vegetables
It’s sounds pathetic as me being anorexic
I do damage like a paralytic paramedic with no anaesthetic
Girls shake my hand, guys want to hug me, it’s a worry
If I forgot your name I’m sorry, you’re probably pretty ugly
I’m scared of getting old, so when it comes D-Day
I’m a thank you all for dissing me, then say something clichéd
And when I’m dead and buried I want you in ‘Life Be In It’ shirts
At my cemetery singing...

[Chorus: Suffa]
Hilltop Hoods and we’re coming up
"Motherfuckers hear my name and get up outta here"
So step on up if you’re dumb enough
"Motherfuckers hear my name and get up outta here"
Hilltop Hoods and we’re coming up
"Bitin'—Bitin' motherfuckers"
So step on up if you’re dumb enough
"Bitin' motherfuckers hear my name and get up outta here"
(Something wrong with me, haha)

[Verse 2: Suffa & (Pressure)]
People chant the chorus; when they hear it, yo it’s on
You rise like a tsunami; when you feel it, it’s the bomb
I’ll make origami of your lyrics
(Geez, that’s good Suffa, what is it?) It’s a swan!
I got the shit to bomb MC's back to the Stone Age
On stage, I’ll get you out your seat quicker than road rage
I take them all from beat jackers to backpackers
With tracks fat as fuck, I ran amok on these whack rappers
But then it happened (what happened?), what I thought could
I screwed all these emcees (yeah?), then it got awkward
"It got weird didn’t it? It got weird..."
You don’t wanna see me anymore
(Oi Suffa, you can’t sing!) Yeah, I can’t even hum a tune
But I make this crowd bounce like bedsprings on a honeymoon (what?)
Come and do your best but it’s still not good enough
Suff is rough, and we're the...

[Chorus: Suffa]
Hilltop Hoods and we’re coming up
"Motherfuckers hear my name and get up outta here"
So step on up if you’re dumb enough
"Motherfuckers hear my name and get up outta here"
Hilltop Hoods and we’re coming up
"Bitin'—Bitin' motherfuckers"
So step on up if you’re dumb enough
"Bitin' motherfuckers"

[Verse 3: Suffa & Pressure]
From the Hilltops in the Andes, to the Rockies in Canada
We infecting mics like Tommy did Pamela
They gassed in the head, that trash you said was pure jealousy
Like "Left Foot, Right Foot" is an invitation to step to me
You’re losing you footing, you need some Velcro on them Shell toes
In fights I’m throwing rhymes, in rhyme fights I’m throwing elbows
I move a crowd like stolen goods, so try and get a hold when
You couldn’t move your shit with a diarrhetic colon
I already told them the hills are impassable, impossible
The truth hurts, this rhyme will put you in hospital
Break it down like a molecule, we burning like fossil fuel
(I’m something of a phenomenon) - I’m phenomenal
These rappers, they don’t wanna fuck with Suff
You better turn off your mic, unless you’re dumb enough
'Cause we’re running up on stage from night until the sun is up
So run amok, you’re with the...

[Chorus (Extended): Suffa]
Hilltop Hoods and we’re coming up
"Motherfuckers hear my name—hear my name—hear my name"
So step on up if you’re dumb enough
"Motherfuckers hear my name—name and get up outta here"
Hilltop Hoods and we’re coming up
"Bitin'—Bitin' mother—motherfuckers"
So step on up if you’re dumb enough
"Motherfuckers hear my name—and get up outta here"
Hilltop Hoods and we’re coming up
So step on up if you’re dumb enough
Hilltop Hoods and we’re coming up
So step on up if you’re dumb enough
