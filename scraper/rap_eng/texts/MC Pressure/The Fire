[Intro: Pressure]
Uh, what. Mr Pressure on the microphone
Almighty Hilltop
Golden Era family
And we do it like...

[Verse: Pressure]
I head for the stage, in the temperature raised
I came penning the phrase with such venom, my blades the page
Get better with age when I'm dead in the grave, they’ll say
Ahead of his age and these veterans paved the way
Never to change if the heavens are raining flames
Red in my veins from the settlers that came in chain
Pressure the name while the rest of them fade away
Better it rains then to never have claimed today
Words of war, my verses murder more
Than police in custody, would prefer to serve the law
So curve that thought, no beef, I'm certain they heard before
Ego won't let 'em crawl so they never learned to walk
For the hurting, poor hard working for
International heard applaud to local suburban tour
Y’all gave a purpose for the roar when the curtains draw
Furthermore ask yourself what you’re searching for?

[Chorus: John Legend (Sampled)]
There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn
You don't say, "Good luck"
You say, "Don't give up"
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn

[Scratches: Jaytee]
"Let it burn"
