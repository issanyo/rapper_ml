[Verse 1: Suffa]
He got me so mad; I’ll jump though the buckle, I’ll
Hurt him so bad, cut the bone through the knuckle, I
Don’t give a fuck if I can’t see, cut my eye
Lids wide open like the wings of a butterfly
I sing for my supper, I
Dance ‘round the ring, and run rings ‘round these other guys
When it’s crunch time, I won’t be undermined
But won’t throw a punch, I’m talking ‘bout fucking rhyme
High jab with another line
Mouth guard in but I still got my tongue in my cheek
My speech so unrefined, make my own mother cry
He ain’t no son of mine
Ain’t no alumni, and you can tell by the way I say alumni
Suffa crush ya, stutter step I duck down left then send you lullaby
We’re machetes to you butter knives, hell I’m ready ‘cause that bloody eye’s
The window to your soul and bro I’m pulling down your shutters I’ve

[Hook: Dan Sultan]
I’ve never been scared of life
Won’t watch it pass me by from my bed
And I’ve never felt so alive
And my eyes have never looked so dead
And some of you might step but that’s by the by
Man we can watch their whole world crumble
Just loosen your neck from side to side
Then rumble young man, rumble
Young man rumble
Young man rumble
Rumble

[Verse 2: Pressure]
They sing out the masses, each round of clashes
Every swing, downed and damaged brings out the savage
The ring sounds, I’m cling bound and bandaged
Which brings round only those things mouthed in madness
They got me on the ropes it’s gone beyond a joke
Corner a lion, no law of confinement will stop me from your throat
Provoking the beast my blood boils
The notion of peace in such toil’s the face hopeless defeat
Shrug of a glance, switch stance, throw one and advance
Succumb to the dance, romance the blood on our hands
Rappers try to a throw a blow these hacks ain’t fighting toe to toe
It ain’t for lack of trying, it’s just that the die and won’t let go
It takes a particular touch, the way to deliver a punch
If the game isn’t vicious enough then we play to the haters ain't giving it up
Let them come, let them fall down now, said it once, said it all round town
I get it done, Dela gonna get em hung, when I come, better run, better haul out south

[Hook: Dan Sultan]
I’ve never been scared of life
Won’t watch it pass me by from my bed
And I’ve never felt so alive
And my eyes have never looked so dead
And some of you might step but that’s by the by
Man we can watch their whole world crumble
Just loosen your neck from side to side
Then rumble young man, rumble
Young man rumble
Young man rumble

[Bridge: Dan Sultan]
I’m bouncing on my toes like
Bouncing on my toes like
Bouncing on my toes like let’s go
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go
I’m bouncing on my toes like
Bouncing on my toes like
Bouncing on my toes like let’s go
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go

[Hook: Dan Sultan]
I’ve never been scared of life
Won’t watch it pass me by from my bed
And I’ve never felt so alive
And my eyes have never looked so dead
And some of you might step but that’s by the by
Man we can watch their whole world crumble
Just loosen your neck from side to side
Then rumble young man, rumble
Young man rumble
Young man rumble

[Bridge: Dan Sultan]
Bouncing on my toes like
Bouncing on my toes like
Bouncing on my toes like let’s go
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go
