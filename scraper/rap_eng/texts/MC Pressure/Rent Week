[Verse 1: Trials]
We twist the lock like Ramirez: grab it and push
Dragging a foot like cavemen dragging a bush
No money, no rent, no way, no bed
Moved out, I’m on the couch, top to toe with the Vents
It’s drinking all week, it’s all of the money off the tour
It’s rinse and repeat, given the Oars dis' for the morgue
It’s spinning the beats drunk till sun like Gary Busey
Suck up and say “Babe”, till she’s saying “That’ll do pig”

[Verse 2: Vents]
There's Suffa in the city skip then I had a bad pinger
Now I’m in the gutter, fuckin' broke, puff a smoke from a Winnie Cigar
Rhyme my blow last, but a jug glass
Other lines of coke, give my liver time to soak
Bon Scott, kind of bloke, passed out in the car
I’m the son cast out from the farm
Hear this blast out from the calm like a child squealing
Pass the bottle, we could chase that feeling

[Chorus: Suffa]
I’m sorry that I’m drunk, I’m sorry that I went on
I’m sorry that I’m broke and that I spent all the rent
But that’s me and that’s all I’ll ever be
There’s some things, some things that I’ll never be
I’m sorry that I’m drunk, I’m sorry that I went on
I’m sorry that I’m broke and that I spent all the rent
But that’s me and that’s all I’ll ever be
There’s some things, some things that I’ll never be

[Verse 3: Briggs]
Bank account overdrawn sheet, over this
Passed out on the lawn getting poked by the neighbour’s kids
With sticks, pockets and wallet, moss and lint
Rent money, that’s gone, yeah I know where it is
I took it to the bar, and I invested in me
At the gentleman’s club, in the stripper’s G
You gotta see the bigger picture, a financial lesson
I put it back in the economy to fight the recession

[Verse 4: Suffa]
You know the score in the morning man, it's boring, your yawning
(You want to see that girl's dress on the floor in the morning)
Nah, I got a girl, but if she let all of these whores in
I’d have four in the morning, pawing and clawing at four in the morning
Stealing and pouring till I don’t know the ceiling from floor and
If I’m kneeling and crawling, lost my keys in an all-in brawl
So, when they're done knocking on my door
Like a Mormon at three in the morning, like…

[Chorus: Suffa]
I’m sorry that I’m drunk, I’m sorry that I went on
I’m sorry that I’m broke and that I spent all the rent
But that’s me and that’s all I’ll ever be
There’s some things, some things that I’ll never be
I’m sorry that I’m drunk, I’m sorry that I went on
I’m sorry that I’m broke and that I spent all the rent
But that’s me and that’s all I’ll ever be
There’s some things, some things that I’ll never be

[Verse 5: Hons]
Molly says Matt lives here but every pay day
It’s like Jack lives here with six cases of beer
I’m a slave to the bottle, bro, ain't changed
You can find my name under “Do not serve” at my Bottle-O
(Shit) Ain’t even like my rent’s steep
Only like four bottles or one ninety a week
Tell my landlord his check will be there in spirit
On my to-do list with Jack, Johnny and Chivas

[Verse 6: Pressure]
If sleep is the cousin of death
Then passed out is the step brother, drunk and a mess
With rum on his breath, guzzling a tonne of regrets
And neither cousin will be coming until nothing is left
Money’s like a new album, I hold it then drop it
Now either there’s a hole in my pocket or someone’s
Stolen my wallet, it pays interesting girls, the more you earn
The more you lose, we live in the most simplest of worlds

[Chorus: Suffa]
I’m sorry that I’m drunk, I’m sorry that I went on
I’m sorry that I’m broke and that I spent all the rent
But that’s me and that’s all I’ll ever be
There’s some things, some things that I’ll never be
I’m sorry that I’m drunk, I’m sorry that I went on
I’m sorry that I’m broke and that I spent all the rent
But that’s me and that’s all I’ll ever be
There’s some things, some things that I’ll never be

[Verse 7: Sesta]
Fresh off tour and I’m broke in both sense of the word
Till X got rent and it went to the birds
I spent it on her, went to the bar
And the rest in the breath test machine cause I’m taking the car
Uh, Marcelo beat that will keep me from going under
Yeah, that’s wicked and all, just give me Trigger’s number, brother
No doubting about the way that I feel
Because dirty money’s still paying my bills, and that’s real
