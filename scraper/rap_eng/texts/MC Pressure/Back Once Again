"Once again
Back it's the incredible"

[Verse 1: Pressure]
Once again the Pressure's back to put it on ya
From the Hilltop, the Southside'll bomb ya
Back to prolong the track up in your section
There's no time to watch, that's why I'm never coming second
My weapon's lyric, consider it more than half a brain
Rap's a part of me like my artery but it's my master vein
I cast a main, infect it with my verbal venom, might wanna bend it
Non-believers  to achievers and hurtled ascending
I just block them like a bridge in this world
With a restraining order, I'm the sort to, never be withheld
I gradually commit battering to your anatomy
Cat got your tongue cause you tried to be flattering
In actuality a competitors blown away like the head of a valley
Thorn proof, so grab me more crew to balance steadier
I'm way ahead of your man, your tracks are lame
I hear you rap for fame
Well I can take the weight, I just hate the back pain
Back again, like reflector said "Don't mess around!"
'Cause not even John Farnham can take the "Pressure Down"
From the inner me, i'm tired of a beginner to be
Making this whole earth sick like an mastic and took Madonna's virginity
With that publicity you talk, you took the fall in your walk
Tripping on some due respect and learn to crawl 'fore I walk
I come real Jimmy, like Steven Seagle, like an airbag
Man, it's just a fact, I'm forever fat
Pressure is back

"Once again, back it's the incredible"
"Once again, back it's the incredible"
"Once again"

[Hook: Pressure & Suffa]
It's the Hoods, we're back once again
And it's all good, but I pack lunches when
Step to Pressure, Suffa, it's the bomb plan
Once for your mind, the Hoods are back on again!
It's the Hoods, we're back once again
And it's all good, but I pack lunches when
Step to Pressure, Suffa, it's the bomb plan
Once for your mind, the Hoods are back on again!

"Once again"
"Once again"
"Once again"
"Once again"
"Once again"
"Once again"
"Once again"
"Once again"

[Verse 2: Suffa]
The Hoods are back, back once again
Mix a sum I'm about to catch wreck
Like a bull in a China shop
Coming from a land down under, we are
"Back to reality" (wohoo)
I elevate your mind like your brain was in a lift
Irritating and the same as the stain of the spliff
On your puffer, Suffa, suffer rock the ricks
This lyric kinda fat, like a san with cutripodis
Irritation of the sore, imitation of the poor
Rappers under the slightly instigation on the law
Information is as raw, inflamation of the raw
I'm writing tense shit that's more raw
That's word to your mother in law
You wanna step son? you gotta catch rec son
It's that hood shit, step over your own grandma to get some
Yet some, refuse to get down when your coming up and
I realised Adelaide's only good for steady fucking
You stuck in the runt, screaming "old school"
Well chump, you're about as old school as last fucking month
I been a drunk, wanna get stuck into me?
Well, I been rocking raps since your grandma lost her virginity
Four infinitely rocking the style from within
You can't fight and win, why's that Pressure?
('Cause you're in for the south, the south side)
And I'm giving you a chance, and your, it's like mumps
You only get it once
So if you front, and kick no flow, here's a life guard
Hoods are on again to make MC's live hard
