[Verse 1: Suffa]
When I lay down to sleep I turn to a deep thinker
Don't wanna be a whinge like a lonely binge drinker
It's just that, well they don't call me Suffa for nothing
I'm a depressed, harrowing, repressed suffering
Maniac, screaming at anybody, anyplace
Man, I love people, I just hate the human race
And I hate all my friends 'cause all my friends are takin' drugs
They think it's spiritual like a hippy making love
But the powders power only lasts for an hour
So they take a powder shower till they burn down like Niki Lauda
Sour times come quicker than a John inside a hooker
With a drum before that, with a drum for my da tinka
Every day for her's the same, leg up, chin up
Left foot, right foot, lay down, shut up
Every day she's getting fucked just like everyone else, man
Damn, screw all your problems, I'ma focus on myself and

[Chorus: Pressure, Suffa & Jodie Morgan]
Left foot, right foot
Keep it movin'
Left foot, right foot
Keep it movin'
Left foot, right foot
Keep it movin'
Left foot, right foot
Keep it movin'

[Verse 2: Pressure]
I spent the last twenty-two years of my life earning my way
Around the world, this space around me, watching night turn to day
I earned some pay in certain ways but it wasn't that
They told me grey's between black and white and opposites attract
Possibly that the world of one man is filled by another
Yo Suffa, we breathe the breath of others, your sanctuary's my cover
This feeling in my upper is possibly life
That matches negative thought so I move positive mics
Probability strikes, random targets live in famine
And the heart is too much for one man to stand regardless
The powder and pills ain't no way to heal my friend
Lean on one shoulder, the other rises like my skills ascend
See life has many ups, many downs and many miles
Many broken promises, hollow words and empty smiles
Consequently many dies when they break from the hit and hate
Drowning in this everyday give or take

[Chorus: Pressure, Suffa & Jodie Morgan]
Left foot, right foot
Keep it movin'
Left foot, right foot
Keep it movin'
Left foot, right foot
Keep it movin'
Left foot, right foot
Keep it movin'

[Chorus: Pressure, Suffa & Jodie Morgan]
Left foot, right foot
Keep it movin'
Left foot, right foot
Keep it movin'
Left foot, right foot
Keep it movin'
Left foot, right foot
Keep it movin'
