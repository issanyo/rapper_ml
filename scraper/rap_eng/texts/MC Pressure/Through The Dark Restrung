[Verse 1: Pressure]
The very day you were born, your light shone bold in the dark
The doctor said you had a hole in your heart
Just knew you were making room for a whole lot of heart
And loved you from that day until your soul would depart
You took your first breath upon my chest
I built you a good nest before I left
It wasn't that I never loved your mother
But two happy homes are better than one that suffered
Every regret in this life that I made
Have been tempered by the strength in your eyes everyday
I know you never said that you’d like me to stay
Still I'm sorry I neglected you while I was away
You were eight when we headed to casualty
And no child should face their death or mortality
You taught me patience, strength and morality
And I'd burden this weight instead of you happily
That night, you asked if you'd die from your sickness
And why had it chosen your life out of millions
You filled me with a pride I was missing
'Cause grown men cry they lack your type of resilience
Only when it’s dark are the stars so bright
For your fight you’re gonna harbour these scars for life
But you a brave little soul, came in the cold
Like a fighter hope you find that same flame when you’re old

[Hook: Pressure]
Fall asleep
And lay with me
We’ll search the night for shooting stars
If they can’t take
Away your pain
I’ll take your hand, walk through the dark
The dark
Through the dark

[Verse 2: Pressure]
I wrote this while you slept in a hospital bed
Know this, your breath at the cost of my breath
I'd forego this life, let you honour my death
If you could know what it’s like to live long and regret
So you can fight, you can shove, you can bleed and hurt
You can cry, you can love, learn your creed or worth
Earn your stripes, act dumb, cut your teeth or worse
Or take a wife to become your sky, sea and earth
But if these are things that you never see
With no god, just me, here to set you free
And most others won’t understand the hell in which you’ve been in
Till they’ve wrestled with a demon
But take heart, to be brave we first need fear
That same heart that’s seen pain yet persevered
Will serve you, I know this world is, of course, unfair
And hurt you, but these virtues are yours to bear
I named you lionhearted the day you’re born
They say the night is darkest before the dawn
I'll take your hand upon this path, if you can light a spark
Then we can find some calm in a raging storm
Ain’t nothing left to scare you, see?
So we can live, laugh and cherish every breath we breathe
And no matter where you go know I’ll never leave
'Cause even when we’re gone we’re living in a memory, so live on

[Hook: Pressure]
Fall asleep
And lay with me
We’ll search the night for shooting stars
If they can’t take
Away your pain
I’ll take your hand, walk through the dark
Fall asleep
And lay with me
We’ll search the night for shooting stars
If they can’t take
Away your pain
I’ll take your hand, walk through the dark
The dark
Through the dark

[Verse 3: Pressure]
And I'm sorry that I can't take your pain, or answer why
We’ll lay awake through darker skies
I say your name, you cast a light
You’re a flame on a starless night
And I didn’t know I was lost till you found me
Didn’t know I was locked here without keys
But we can walk across all these boundaries
You and me, nothing here to stop you, you're now free
So I wrote this to give you hope
For every good thing in life you'll live to know
They say cancer survivors are gifted though
Let me know if that isn’t so
