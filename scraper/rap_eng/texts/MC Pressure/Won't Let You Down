[Ad-Libs: Maverick Sabre]

[Verse 1: Suffa]
They say you can't love and be wise, but I can pretend wit'chu
If suddenly I ever had to surrender you, I’d
Fall in a heap; I’d fall on the floor, and
Crawl on all fours, for you I’d fall on my sword
If grief ever darkened my door you’d light it up
The way you brighten up a room hit’s me right in the
Chest, it puts the breath inside of my
Lungs, it’s like I leapt in the light of the
Sun, and in spite of my weary frown
You wear a smile that wears me down, so hear me out
I know that I wasted time
When I should have been replacing your last name with mine
And that mistake is mine believe me
I wear it like its sunburn, it might disappear but it won’t leave me
I’ll carry you on my shoulders, never set you down
Ferry you through the coldness, never let you down

[Chorus: Maverick Sabre]
I won’t let you down
Won’t let you down again
I won’t let you down
Won’t let you down again
Said I won’t

[Verse 2: Pressure]
Travelling man in the back of a van
Capturing sands like time through the back of my hand
If I could hold it for a moment, do a lap of this land
I’d console you for a moment then be back in a glance
But I’m, so far since we left for the road
To chase the sun around the heavens and globe
Searching for the next episode, problem is that letting it go
Would be like letting go of everything I treasure and know
And whenever I go I think your chest will explode
A martyr with your heart like Brandon Lee’s death in The Crow
Try and understand where I lay my head is my home
And I was in love before this rap shit was ever in vogue
But if you feel that you’re ever alone
While standing in the same room as me let’s set it in stone
You can’t save me, a queen to this devilish rogue
But you’re bravely willing to give a hell of go so

[Chorus: Maverick Sabre]
I won’t let you down
Won’t let you down again
I won’t let you down
Won’t let you down again
Said I won’t

[Bridge: Maverick Sabre]
I hate that I wasted your touch and your taste
It’s my shame and can’t change it, want you to remain
My angel, my heartbeat, come closer, I’m sorry
My soul is yours, surely you know this

[Verse 3: Suffa]
And you know that I
Won’t be shy talking ‘bout what you’ve given me
Conflict diamond, you shine through the misery
You walk in a room and light it up, that’s just with your entry
You walk in a room and light it up like it was four twenty
Some people never find out what they have
Only ever find out what they had, and I could’a been
One of them, don’t know if I still won’t
And that thought hangs around my neck like a millstone
For real though, it’s like I lost you, left you, let you go
Before I got to get you or let you know
That you’re my refuge, and I need you to see
The only one that I let down more than you is me

[Outro: Maverick Sabre]
And I won’t let you down
And I won’t let you down
I won’t let you down
Won’t let you down again
I won’t let you down
I won’t let you down again
