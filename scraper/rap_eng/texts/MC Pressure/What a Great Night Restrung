[Verse 1: Suffa]
This is for the hopeless, the homeless, the brokest, the dopest
The smokers, the jokers on opiates and coke, it's
Your choice, I won't judge you tonight
'Cause I'm paraletic, I ain't looking to lose a fight so
Put your hands up if you're not to drunk to stand up
If you bombing up the toilets put your man up
And put your can up, spray it in the air mate
Check out my man, [fuck] it's all going pear shaped
They call me Suff, when I'm drunk they call me "[fuck] off"
Head under the bar trying to drink the run off
I'm a one of a kind, I'll rhyme till I'm cut off
Or just to [fucking] blind to get one off
Don't call me son of a [bitch], I'm the son of an angel
When the sun of the morning hits, it's so painful
These all nighters are killing me
But it's all right, are you feeling me?

[Hook: Suffa]
And it's all love, and it's alright
Till we're all drunk, then it's all fights
Then it's all over, go home, go sleep
Wake up, get sober, what a great night
And it's all love, and it's alright
Till we're all drunk, then it's all fights
Then it's all over, go home, go sleep
Wake up, get sober, what a great night

[Verse 2: Pressure]
This is for the reckless, the restless, deafest and freshest
The jester's and senseless on heroin or meth it's
Your call, we ain't judging you now
'Cause on or off tap, we ain't [fucking] around so
Feel a girl up if your not too drunk to get it up
And if she's throwing up, make sure her hair is up
But beware that you're not riding Caboose pal
Check out these chicks, [fuck] they all getting loose now
They call me Presh, when I'm drunk they call me scumbag
Hands up in your till, snatch a bill then run back
I'll take them one at a time once they find out I done that
These bars ain't never gonna let me come back
Don't call me son of a [bitch], I'm the son of a muso
And the sum of my problems is substance abuse so
These longs nights are the death of me
But it's all right, it's my legacy

[Hook: Suffa]
And it's all love, and it's alright
Till we're all drunk, then it's all fights
Then it's all over, go home, go sleep
Wake up, get sober, what a great night
And it's all love, and it's alright
Till we're all drunk, then it's all fights
Then it's all over, go home, go sleep
Wake up, get sober, what a great night

[Pre-Hook: Suffa]
Gin and tonic, you rock the house
And a tequila shots, you rock the house
And a Chivas Regal, you rock the house
And a Jager bombs, you rock the house

[Hook: Suffa]
And it's all love, and it's alright
Till we're all drunk, then it's all fights
Then it's all over, go home, go sleep
Wake up, get sober, what a great night
And it's all love, and it's alright
Till we're all drunk, then it's all fights
Then it's all over, go home, go sleep
Wake up, get sober, what a great night
