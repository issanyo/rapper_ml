[Verse 1: Suffa]
C'mon, before the Green Machine try to spy with a man
Before the legal teams tried to arm on a stair
Before the CIA taught Osama to dance [?]
Before the healthcare brands used to palm on weekends
Before the sun was harmless apart from the tan
Before the Bon and Clyde kids were asking for grams
Before Mr Ronnie Biggs became a target and ran
Hand on my heart, heart in my hand
We've been here forever

[Verse 2: Pressure]
I married my art before the
Cathede writers painted trams of the art, [?]
Before Kool Herc threw a jam in the park, back in the start
Rapping like when Michael Jackson was dark

Before the prohibition, I got banned from the bar
Fuck it, before Noah made plans for the Ark
Heart in my hand, hand on my heart
We've been here forever

See what I'm saying? I'll say it again
We've been here forever

Before the New Yorker's sprayed their art from a can
Before the true authors gave you parts of the plan
Before the Son of Sam fed a shark from his hand [?]
Before the fox drank blood from the heart of the lamb
Before the U.S government sold arms to Iran
Before the land was scorched by mark of the man
Before time bomb caught in a heart from a fan
Hand on my heart, heart in my hand
We've been here forever

[Verse 5: Pressure]
I was planning to start before the
Politicians murdered, danced in the dark
Before the World Wars left a planet with scars
Masses that marched when the Third Reich landed in France
Before the extremists on the evangelists path
I swore the/before the, dream, wishes stopped and Africa starved
Before the epidemics, AIDS, cancer and SARS
Heart in my hand, hand on my heart
We've been here forever

[Verse 6: Briggs]
Before the little rascals started making a mess
Before they killed animals and started taking their heads
Before Elvis and 2Pac faking their deaths
Before Diddy lost Biggie started taking a breath
'fore Forman considered even facing the best
Before John Dillinger was escaping the Fed's
Before having sex meant taking a test
See what I'm saying? I'll say it again
We've been here forever

[Verse 7: Suffa]
Before the nuclear bomb left a scar on Japan
Before the troops went on to napalm in [?]
Before the meth dealers saw the narks and they ran
Before the fresh dealers tore up parks with their jams
Before the major labels rigged the charts with a scam
Before the suits and beefers got marketed and planned
Before the children of Abraham carved a path in the sand
Hand on my heart, heart in my hand
We've been here forever

[Verse 8: Briggs]
Before the guest was making a threat
Before the Bali Nine strapped H to their legs
Before Jay Z's crawlspace was making a stench
Before Jefferey Dahmer had a taste for the flesh
Before the Wu Tang clan was saving their necks
Before Lebron James ran, came of the bench
Before Micky, Belly, Bopper fell straight to their deaths
See what I'm saying? I'll say it again
We've been here forever
