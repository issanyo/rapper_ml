[Verse 1: Pressure]
Early morn, train station, aching from the arthritis
This war veteran knows what a hard time is
He needs his pension, dementia and half blind is
The reason he rides the train with no car license
So he boards with an expired ticket has a swipe
Gets a fine 'cause the change he got don't add up right
We're talking about a man who never lived a lavish life
Caught up in the age of computer chips and satellites
A lovely lady boards looking tired and half awake
He smiles, she's reminds him of his wife that passed away
She says something as she walks right past his way
His old hearing aid don't last quite half the day
Some young gentlemen alive with their laughter
Approach the old timer and put a knife to his heart to
Explain that money or bloods the price of their barter
To a man whose friends probably died for their fathers

[Pre-Hook/Turntablism: DJ Debris]
"Taking a train"
"I head towards the train station"
"Riding the kaboose to hell"
"We're from a city heroin loves, the devil's in charge"

[Hook: Pressure]
Whatever it takes can justify
Whatever ends we make, whatever the price
To the end of a life, it's just an observation
So take a ride, we're stopping all stations

[Verse 2: Pressure]
It's been a long night the suns lifting on a cold
Morning but she's drugged and drunk tripping on her stroll
On the way home, she's done with stripping on a pole
But she can't pay for her son living on the dole
Jumps a train puts on her gloves she's wearing black
Being watched by some old mug she's glaring back
She's on edge and got the bug from sharing smack
So she says, "Hey, what the [fuck] you staring at?"
He smiles, an unsteady hand rubs on his dome
She takes a seat, a messy band of ruffs board alone
To the digger with a machete at his lungs and he's prone
He can barely stand but ready to stand up for his own
She tries to help him she doesn't choose to flee the car
And catches a blow with enough bruise to leave a scar
She starts fainting, the rooms moving and seeing stars
Ain't it amazing how courageous human beings are?

[Hook: Pressure]
Whatever it takes can justify
Whatever ends we make, whatever the price
To the end of a life, it's just an observation
So take a ride, we're stopping all stations

[Verse 3: Suffa]
He knows nothing but hard work and scraping by
Looking for a purse or a wallet so he can make a buy
He hasn't been on the nod since this morning
He needs to touch the face of god, his skin is just crawling
These peeps are sheep, time to fleece the market
Jumps a train with some friends, sees an easy target
An old man hard hit with age, fainthearted
The kid pulls a knife like, "Let's get started"
A girl steps, he's like eat the carpet
Laughs with his friends like she's retarded
The old man stepped and swept the assailant
Off his feet, his head connected with the railing
Man you're weak the old man said as the kid lay recovering
Blubbering, "get to your feet I'll tell you another thing
A real man never lays his hands on a woman
A real man would know that, no surprise that you wouldn't
I didn't fight in two wars just so forty years later
You'd have the freedom to rob me on the train, this behaviour
Doesn't fit with what I gave this country so cut me
Won't live another day in a world that's so ugly"

[Outro: Pressure]
So take a ride, 'cause we're stopping all stations
