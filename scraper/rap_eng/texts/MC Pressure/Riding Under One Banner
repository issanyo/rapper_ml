[Verse 1: Suffa]
I make tracks for the certified, for the b-boys
For the disempowered, for the unemployed
For the worried mothers counting groceries
For my friends, my family, people who are close to me
And if you're close to me, I'm loyal to the end
'Cause I'm too bad with names to make new friends, and
I'm too opinionated to keep my mouth shut
I'ma turn the world upside down and put the south up
On top of this, we rocking this 'cause I ain't got nothing else
And it helps when I see the city suffering
I'm rupturing lyrics, haemorrhaging tracks
Bleeding out my personality all over the wax
So DJs get your fingers deep in my haemoglobin
Call me safe breaker from the way I always get ya open
Suffa MC, get down with your suffering self
I make tracks 'cause I ain't got nothing else

[Hook 1: Suffa & Pressure]
It's like this, it's like that and a
Crossbred riding under one banner
It's like this, it's like that and a
My man Trauma's riding under one banner
It's like this, it's like that and a
After Hours riding under one banner
It's like this

[Verse 2: Suffa]
Hip hop and cigarettes fill my day
Pour my worries in a cup and watch them spill away
I feel today is just yesterday waiting to happen
That's why I have no patience with my rapping
Gotta get these tracks written, rehearse 'em till they're tight
Make beats all day, record the verses through the night
I make tracks for kids in bedrooms and hotels, apartments
In cars with their partners and motels
In camper vans, caravans, Combi-vans, cruise-ships
Make tracks for my brothers who taught me to love music
Make tracks for kids in the sub-terrainean
I even make tracks for Yanks who love Australians
Make tracks for girls in the Mediterranean
Who sit by the window singing "here comes the rain again"
I make tracks for the love, for myself
I make tracks 'cause I ain't got nothing else

It's like this, it's like that and a
Funkoars are riding under one banner
It's like this, it's like that and a
My man Blockade's riding under one banner
It's like this, it's like that and a
Expressionist is riding under one banner
It's like this

[Hook 3: Suffa & Pressure]
This, it's like that and a
Terra Firma are riding under one banner
It's like this, it's like that and a
My man Kollaps is riding under one banner
It's like this, it's like that and the
(Certified Wise) riding under one banner
It's like this
