[Chorus (Sampled): Ernie K-Doe]
Looking so good, it's a doggone shame
That they couldn't all be mine
Looking so pretty, it's a doggone pity
Oh, you're looking so fine
Here come the girls!
Looking so good, it's a doggone shame
That they couldn't all be mine
Here come the girls!
Looking so pretty, it's a doggone pity
Oh, you're looking so fine

[Verse 1: Pressure]
I need a girl that ain't looking for the perfect fella
And doesn't care if I'm broke or I'm earning cheddar
One that can service Pressure while she works a Webber
And knows she's late when I ain't got the nerve to tell her
What I want is a woman that's hotter than December
A goddess that wouldn't mind me proper on a bender
Honest I'd put in my promise and surrender
As long as the pushing lasts longer than her temper
For this girl I'd throw all aside
A wild one with attitude and no rules to guide
Ain't obsessed with her looks or own foolish pride
And only ring she wants is a phone call at night (damn right)
I want a girl that's down for breaking the law
Rough exterior with heart hidden away at the core
One that'll wait at the door if I've been away on tour
With handcuffs on the bed and duct tape on the floor

[Chorus (Sampled): Ernie K-Doe]
Looking so good, it's a doggone shame
That they couldn't all be mine
Here come the girls!
Looking so pretty, it's a doggone pity
Oh, you're looking so fine
Here come the girls!
Looking so good, it's a doggone shame
That they couldn't all be mine
Here come the girls!
Looking so pretty, it's a doggone pity
Oh, you're looking so fine

[Verse 2: Suffa]
I need a girl that's like
Cold paddles on a bleeding heart
Ava Adore, we must never be apart
I need a girl that ain't torn the scene up
A storm in a D-cup, who don't mind porn or a pre-nup
(Check) I need a chick that plays video games
Not the type to complain and never give me no brain
And don't give me cocaine addicted
Honey going through my jeans for money, hiding meth in her lipstick
She talk like she's tasting me, she walks like she's chasing me
'Cause I ain't chasing Amy like Jason Lee, basically
I need a fox in some fishnets, putting pots in the Dishlex
Who don't run from spiders and squash her own insects
Intense, makeup running, crazy beautiful
Make love in the sun and graze me with her cuticle
Head in the clouds with one foot on the ground
She'd put up with me even when I'm putting it down

[Bridge (Sampled): Ernie K-Doe]
Bored out of my head (hey!)
While the boxers do their thing (hoo-hoo-hoo!)
You make me feel so good inside
I got to jump up and say (aaah!)
Naa, naa, naa, naa!
Naa, naa, naa naa!
Here come the girls!
Naa, naa, naa, naa!
Naa, naa, naa naa!

[Verse 3: Suffa]
I need a girl that's like... check the god's dimples
She'd love me even if I looked like Don Rickles
Drooling like pitbulls, hot but not fickle
So loyal, not spoiled, and smart, so not simple
She'd be complex, on lock, want sex, non-stop
Pop tops off beer for me, girl would even pop-lock
Crop top, mid riff, not the town bicycle
Bisexual mistress with eyes like icicles

[Verse 3: Pressure]
Send me an angel sipping bitter lager
Envision her to visit the strippers with her partner
I don't need a girl living with her father
It's sort of just torturous like that chick in Nicaragua
She's tasteful, graceful, nothing short of a ten
In lingerie when the longest day draws to an end
She knows dating's an occasion with laws that attend
Cause three's a crowd, unless her friend's more than her friend

[Chorus (Sampled): Ernie K-Doe]
Here come the girls!
Looking so good, it's a doggone shame
That they couldn't all be mine
Here come the girls!
Looking so pretty, it's a doggone pity
Oh, you're looking so fine
Here come the girls!
Looking so good, it's a doggone shame
That they couldn't all be mine
Here come the girls!
