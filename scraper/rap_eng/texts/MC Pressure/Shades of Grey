TRANSCRIPTION IS UNFINISHED

[Intro:]
Shades of grey, shades of grey

[Verse 1: Pressure]
Take a good look, and tell me what you see but not
What to be, I want to free, my life is falling in monopoly
With the monotony of each sunrise, this loss of colour
Runs in the times, with it sitting in my mind but it's just another
Shade of grievous grey, like the previous day
You're picking 'round in my thoughts, seeking to lead me astray
Won't you lead me away, from all the drama for real
'Cause what they come for to kill, the marijuana will heal
Yeah, I'll be kicked 'round but wouldn't sit down, but no one else
Getting caught up in this shit
