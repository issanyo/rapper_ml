[Intro: Voiceover w/ scratching]
They were recording enough music for 2 albums, that was premeditated. They weren't just like 'lets make a record and we'll pick the best 10 or 12 songs', it was from day one 'we're making 2 albums'

[Verse: Pressure]
We’re still here, ain’t leaving, built here, ain't leaving
Marched till the sun was down, and felt this landscape breathing
A blurred line came between them
Yo I don’t know if I’m chasing dreams or escaping demons
Though it's a sign when you're loaded on the road all the time
Woke up to find I was at home, and didn't know it was mine
Sobered up fine, took it slower, know what's blowing my mind
Had a baby boy to focus my devotion and time
Now my hands tied, man this life don't get easier
My Nan died, older son got Leukaemia
World spinning like poltergeist, try take my own advice
And transfer this anguish to my only vice
Took a breather when I knew it was a problem
To take a look and see if something beautiful could blossom
And find some time to release this record
But sometimes sunshine’s when you least expect it
That love you got for me, for real I’m humbled honestly
It still make me feel like I hit the fucking lottery
We steel up a fist, to fill the abyss
My friends it gets no realer than this
We just continue on
Two years, one album nothing left, just writing these songs
Continue on
No apologies, my whole discography been righting my wrongs

[Hook: Aaradhna]
We arrive in the night
We come alive in the night
Strip the sky of its colour
We’ll run the expanse in the absence of light
Walking under stars we breathe the night
Walking under stars we breathe the night
Walking under stars we breathe the night
Walking under stars we breathe the night
Walking under stars we breathe the night
Walking under stars we breathe the night
