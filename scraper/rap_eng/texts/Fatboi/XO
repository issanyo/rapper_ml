[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
If I never say I appreciate you
I'll say it with a X-O, X-O
And if I'm too shy and I can't face you
I'll say it with a X-O, X-O
And if I ran away right now, to your email
So in love that you know
That I really love you
I'll tell you how I feel through X, X-O

[Verse 1: Jason Caesar]
On my way home
I just spent a long, long night in the studio
I pick up my phone
'Cause there are a few things that I really need you to know
So I get to typing out my feelings
(All the things I never wanna say)
These are all the words you should be hearing
(Girl, they make me feel some kind of way)

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Caesar]
Words come easy
When I try to put them in a song
And everything goes out right
You'll believe me
It's a little harder when I try to tell you how I feel

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
And if I never say I appreciate you
I'll say it with a X-O, X-O
And if I'm too shy and I can't face you
I'll say it with a X-O, X-O
And if I ran away right now, to your email
So in love that you know
That I really love you
I'll tell you how I feel through X, X-O

[Verse 2: Jason Caesar]
Pride's in the way
Tomorrow isn't promised, so I gotta let you know today
Don't wanna complicate
Just wanna say I need you in my corner, I appreciate
Everything you do for me
Even though it's hard to speak
How I really feel, I hope you know it's real
Girl, you know it's one for free

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Caesar]
Words come easy
When I try to put them in a song
And everything goes out right
You'll believe me
It's a little harder when I try to tell you how I feel

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
And if I never say I appreciate you
I'll say it with a X-O, X-O
And if I'm too shy and I can't face you
I'll say it with a X-O, X-O
And if I ran away right now, to your email
So in love that you know
That I really love you
I'll tell you how I feel through X, X-O

[Verse 3: Laws]
X-O, X-O
Thinking it when I was in stress mode
Back then, I was feeling exposed
Now I understand what we met for
So I could let go
You and the intuition, I guess for
Kind of like a club with no dress code
Every night, I'm a special guest, so
Let's go, let's go
If we gonna go, let's go hard
To a place where there ain't no card
Scenery looking like a postcard
Wish you were here
You give me a vision and it is so clear
Whenever I'm thinking of quitting, all I do is think of you near
And them things disappear, X-O

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
If I never say I appreciate you
I'll say it with a X-O, X-O
And if I'm too shy and I can't face you
I'll say it with a X-O, X-O
And if I ran away right now, to your email
So in love that you know
That I really love you
I'll tell you how I feel through X, X-O
