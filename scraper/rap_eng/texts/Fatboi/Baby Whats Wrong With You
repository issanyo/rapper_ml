[Intro]
Fuck, girls fly like Peter do
He ain't fly like Peter though
She like "I left my weed at home"
To see me, you need bifocals
Yeah yeah yeah, leave it alone
To see me, you need bifocals
To see me, you need bifocals

[Hook]
To see me you need bifocals
Green fly like Peter do
She like "I left my weed at home, can you get me stoned?"
Baby, that is not an excuse
So what you wanna do?
You ain't gotta roll one baby, you can roll a few
But I ain't gon' smoke with you
Steady asking me what I'm on with you
Baby what's wrong with you?

[Verse]
Baby said she on me, glue
My .30 stay on me too
And I shoot a movie too
'Member posted on the block
Fucking on one of my opps
Let the bitch try to set me up
She gonna be stuck between a rock and this motherfucking Glock
My bitch bad, she terrible
Beat a bitch like Keta do
Foreign all my vehicles
And I gotta thank Jesus too
Girl I love it when it's easy too
'Member when they would leave me too?
'Member when they ain't even need me too?
Well now they need me too

[Hook]
To see me you need bifocals
Green fly like Peter do
She like "I left my weed at home, can you get me stoned?"
Baby, that is not an excuse
So what you wanna do?
You ain't gotta roll one baby, you can roll a few
But I ain't gon' smoke with you
Steady asking me what I'm on with you
Baby what's wrong with you?
