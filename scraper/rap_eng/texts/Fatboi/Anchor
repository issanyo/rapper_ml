[Verse 1]
I can't think about the rain
As the tears fall down your face
And the clouds won't go away
A thousand times I fell over and over again
But you were there to lift me up
And when I couldn't stand you were my crutch

'Cause there ain't nothing more special than love
'Cause what we got is more than enough
We gotta hold on no matter what

[Chorus]
Through the rain (through the rain)
Through the rain (through the rain)
Through the waves
Through the fog
Through the storm
I'll be by your side
Right by your side
I can't let you down
Won't let you down
Cos i'm your anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor
Anchor Anchor Anchor

Beside me, you were there to guide me
Said I could be anything
Said we could make it through anything
That closed door (that closed door)
That hurricane (that hurricane)
No matter what, we still remain, oh
Cos we've been through worse
Back to this wall
When no one was there
Only one I could call
That's why I'm thanking God for you
'Cause don't know what I would do without you

'Cause they ain't nothing more special than love
'Cause what we got is more than enough
We gotta hold on no matter what

(Through the rain)
Through the rain
Through the waves
Through the fog
Through the storm
I'll be by your side
Right by your side
I can't let you down
Won't let you down
Cos i'm your
Anchor (I'm your anchor)
Anchor (i'm your anchor)
Anchor (yeah yeah)
Anchor Anchor Anchor

OHHH OHHH OHHHH OHHH
I will be there for you ( for you, for you)
Thats what a friend's supposed to do (for you, for you)
In your darkest times i'll help you see
OOHHH whoa
That's when you find your faith in love
In the middle of the storm
I will be there

Through the rain (through the rain)
Through the waves (through the waves)
Through the fog (through the fog)
Through the storm
I'll be by your side (be by your side)
Right by your side
I can't let you down ( can't let you down)
Won't let you down
Cos i'm your
Anchor

Through the rain (through the rain)
Through the waves  (through the waves)
Through the fog (through the fog)
Through the storm (OHH whoa ohh)
I'll be by your side ( i will be)
Right by your side ( by your side)
I can't let you down
Won't let you down
Cos i'm your
Anchor (Through the rain, Through the waves)
Anchor (Through the fog, Through the storm)
Anchor (I'll be by your side, Right by your side)

When you feeling down

I'll be your anchor, your anchor
Through the storm
