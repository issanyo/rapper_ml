[Hook]
Nothin' comes to a sleeper but a dream
You shouldn't believe everythin' you see
I know that times get hard
Get on your hands and knees and pray to God, baby
Cause it's out of your control
Out of your control
Out of your control

[Verse 1]
I was down bad, I was hella broke
I can't belive that a man is just stay afloat
I say my mama on my head
Tellin' me to go and get some bread
I knew I couldn't work a 9 to 5
Cause my passion is on the stage live
I'm soo up right now, I know, I know, let's go
But I can't fall asleep because I know...

[Hook]
Nothin' comes to a sleeper but a dream
You shouldn't believe everythin' you see
I know that times get hard
Get on your hands and knees and pray to God, baby
Cause it's out of your control
Out of your control
Out of your control

[Verse 2]
One weekend I make 40
Man I'm grindin' everyday cause I want it
I want 'em Grammys and shit, I want 'em cars and shit
I just been at it soo long, you can tell that shit
Get up, pop your ass and go ahead and get it
If that drink make you slow down, you shouldn't even sip it
You gotta go vertical, man that's protocol
I knew when 'em labels called, I knew I was made to ball

[Hook]
Nothin' comes to a sleeper but a dream
You shouldn't believe everythin' you see
I know that times get hard
Get on your hands and knees and pray to God, baby
Cause it's out of your control
Out of your control
Out of your control
