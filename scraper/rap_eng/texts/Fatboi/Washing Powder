Oj Da Juiceman – Washing Powder Money

Chorus:
I got washing powder money – I don’t wash it, I don’t wash it
I got trap and thrill the money – I don’t roll it, I don’t drove it
I got airplaine money, man the sky and Im loaded
With them thousand dollar jeans, pocket like a bomb exploded

Stoopid stoopid hundred got the juice with tha money
Uuh, the nuddle, doktor little, pocket just like ram the nuddle, ekstra loaded with them soft shit. My trap house go super stoopid

Stoopid with the right hand cooking, turn the water supercrazy
Sicks the spot, super ham – papa go with your lady
Dark meat alligator, shark tail, shrimps and tomatoes
Piggy ring stoopid, get it like I was one of the Lakers

Fou Fou to cutless, same color as master
Cost me 5 bricks, but it’s ragged up with nothing
Bought a whole pound – smoke on a sunday

Every night and country nigga I respect the money gangs
Over see the Chinatown, talking with my dollars main
Been a whole like soccer soccer, choppin up tje china ground
White rhims, stoopid rhims – damn I got the right plan
At the way I’m goin I don’t pass the couple of millions man
Fall up in the club, got the club joining the juice dance
Man my flow like the air, thats the way you make them bounce
