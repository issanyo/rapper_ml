[Verse 1: Jason Caesar]
I'm sitting here at the station, impatiently waiting
To see if your train will come
My heart is torn and tattered, my ego is shattered
Girl, you were the only one
I'm damaged, baby, ain't no maybe
This is the end of my life
I was custom-fitted and you did it
I'm yours and you're mine
But now that I'm all broken, who's gonna want me now?
Running in and out of love has got our souls worn out

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Caesar]
I hear the music and the violins are crying for us
I think I'ma lose it and my heart is screaming, join the chorus

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
'Cause I heard that misery loves company
I'm hearing my misery come fuck with me
And I hear the melody making fun of me
And I heard that misery loves company
'Cause I heard that misery loves company
I'm hearing my misery come fuck with me
And I hear the melody making fun of me
And I heard that misery loves company

[Verse 2: Stanza]
I wear my heart on my sleeve that makes defeat super hard to receive
I need a piece to relieve the pain that dwells within me, I'm weak
But I am strong in this misery
It seeps so very deep inside my soul, it personifies in speeches
Says, "I'm inside of your womb, I'm a part of your thoughts
I'm here to torture you with vengeance and kill you with your thoughts
Make you make stupid decisions, like dual-risk incisions
After kidnapping your children and burning your ex's building down"
I should drown for this thinking 'cause I am sinking, really
I want them nights, what it'd be like to swing from the ceiling
I hope you're better, bitch, you left me with this feeling
Here's your letter, I'm on spaghetti junction, jumping bridges

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Caesar]
I hear the music and the violins are crying for us
I think I'ma lose it and my heart is screaming, join the chorus

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
'Cause I heard that misery loves company
I'm hearing my misery come fuck with me
And I hear the melody making fun of me
And I heard that misery loves company
'Cause I heard that misery loves company
I'm hearing my misery come fuck with me
And I hear the melody making fun of me
And I heard that misery loves company

[Outro]
I heard that misery loves company
Come fuck with me
I heard that misery loves company
