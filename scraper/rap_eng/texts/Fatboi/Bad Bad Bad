[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Rap game paid me, trap game made me
We used to be good friends now she
Can't stand me her man ain't G her man
Ain't me her man can't be what her man can't be
My jewelery game fridgy- white watch blizzard
Crocodile lizard pinky ring ignorant;
I'm careful who I step to when I step too
And if I choose first she choose me then she special
Long walks all night dawg I can help her bless her
Show her how to be successful kiss her Gucci hustler
Sudden valley cook up second of the extra
Stack up loud pack make her catch a contact
Dumb sets long stacks, I can make her come back

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm a bad boy but still there's so much good in me
You can take me out the hood the hood is still in me
I need a girl to feel herself but can still feel me
Just let me be your only choice no need for plan B!
My love life is malnutritions you my vitamin C-
Stay down like Hillary and I can be your Billy
I'll buy you Jada pinky pinkies I'm the biggest willy
Just when I give it throw it back just like we playing
Frisbee I can do it by myself but I'd be very lonely
Be the diva who's my lover and my closest homie
So if you sick and tired of being sick and tired call me
Pick up the yellow pages and look up Gucci! (Gucci! )

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself

[Verse 3: Keyshia Cole]
Ain't no need in arguing about it
If you wanna leave then just be 'bout it
There's no sense in blaming me and me blaming
You there's no reason to be untrue everything
I got to work hard for everyday I work hard to
Make more I can do bad all by myself I ain't trying
Play love games cause I can do bad baby your title

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself
