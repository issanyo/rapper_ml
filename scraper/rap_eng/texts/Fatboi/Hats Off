[Intro]
Hats off to you, hats off to you
Hats off to you, hats off to you

[Verse 1]
This don't feel the same in this rubber coat
I wanna feel the rain while I rock the boat
I wanna really go in
Caution to the wind
I wanna hit a lick, I gotta let you know
Like a porno flick with no remote control
I wanna feel it all
So I wanna hit it raw

[Pre-Chorus]
Hats off, I wanna feel it
Whatever happens, I don't give a damn
Baby, hats off, I hope you feel me
'Cause girl, tonight, I'm not a Trojan man
You feel so good inside [?]
Just imagine the true love
You make me wanna take my hat off
You make me wanna take my hat off

[Chorus]
Hats off to you, girl, come and do it
Hats off to you, or I'ma bust through it
Take it off, I don't really wanna feel it
When you scream, I don't wanna hear it
There's only one thing left to do
Hats off to you

[Verse 2]
I know that it would feel this good
But only in my dreams
I asked you and you understood
You even took it off for me
You said, "Baby, I feel it
Skin on skin, no interruptions"
Now that I'm in it, I'm gon' kill it
You'll get this sexual eruption

[Pre-Chorus]
Hats off, I wanna feel it
Whatever happens, I don't give a damn
Baby, hats off, I hope you feel me
'Cause girl, tonight, I'm not a Trojan man
You feel so good inside [?]
Just imagine the true love
You make me wanna take my hat off
You make me wanna take my hat off

[Chorus]
Hats off to you, girl, come and do it
Hats off to you, or I'ma bust through it
Take it off, I don't really wanna feel it
When you scream, I don't wanna hear it
There's only one thing left to do

[Outro]
Hats off to you, hats off to you
Hats off to you, hats off to you
Hats off to you
Hats off to you
