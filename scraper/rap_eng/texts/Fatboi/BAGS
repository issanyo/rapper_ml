[Hook]
Oh, I gotta get the bag
Cause pretty girls love bags
No you ain't shit without a bag
No you ain't shit without a bag
Bag, gotta go get that bag
Gotta go get that bag
Bag, bitch you want that new bag?
Gotta go get that bag
Gotta go get that bag
Gotta go get that

[Verse 1]
You hear me comin' out your speakers
I got on thousand dollar sneakers
Girl, I'm flyer than an eagle
Makin' movies like regal
Man, I'm everywhere she at
Everywhere I go is a kickback
Y'all niggas ducks like Aflac
You know I got a bag, bag, bag, bag, bag
This shit crazy how I handle that
I was just raised like that
Don't say shit when I pull up on you
Damn that Gucci look good on you
Bad girls like good bags
For the lames hoes, it's too bad
If you want a bag go get it
I just like to run full digits

[Hook]
Oh, I gotta get the bag
Cause pretty girls love bags
No you ain't shit without a bag
No you ain't shit without a bag
Bag, gotta go get that bag
Gotta go get that bag
Bag, bitch you want that new bag?
Gotta go get that bag
Gotta go get that bag
Gotta go get that

[Verse 2]
My nigga Fat on the beat, baby
So you know what that means, baby
I gotta go all the way mean, baby
I gotta go all the way mean, baby
Could say this, I'm puttin' preasure on y'all
You can't say that you ball
If it's a bag you ain't ball
What in the hell that you thought?
I might scoop your main chick up
Cause she was down and I'm what's up
Bad girls like good bags
For the lames hoes, it's too bad
If you want a bag go get it
I just like to run full digits

[Hook]
Oh, I gotta get the bag
Cause pretty girls love bags
No you ain't shit without a bag
No you ain't shit without a bag
Bag, gotta go get that bag
Gotta go get that bag
Bag, bitch you want that new bag?
Gotta go get that bag
Gotta go get that bag
Gotta go get that

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
You know what's goin' on
