[Verse 1]
Your access has been waiting
You can join me on the trip until the flashing lights
Boy, you're [?], greedy [?]
Something you have never seen, but you're with me tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't nothing change but the time zone and my clothes
I'm international, I'm international
I get my sleep on the plane 'cause the club don't close
I'm international, I'm international

[Chorus]
It's you and me
We can go with the breeze
Girl, I can change your life with the club night
Leave all your stress here at home, girl, you know I'm international

[Verse 2]
No [?], you'll discover
That it's always VIP when you're with me, all right
Inhibitions, what are they, girl?
Don't let this moment slip away 'cause the feeling's right

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't nothing change but the time zone and my clothes
I'm international, I'm international
I get my sleep on the plane 'cause the club don't close
I'm international, I'm international

[Chorus]
It's you and me
We can go with the breeze
Girl, I can change your life with the club night
Leave all your stress here at home, girl, you know I'm international

[Bridge]
I'm hot, so hot
I'm hot, so hot
I'm hot, so hot
I'm hot, you're not
Come here, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't nothing change but the time zone and my clothes
I'm international, I'm international
I get my sleep on the plane 'cause the club don't close
I'm international, I'm international

[Chorus]
It's you and me
We can go with the breeze
Girl, I can change your life with the club night
Leave all your stress here at home, girl, you know I'm international
It's you and me
We can go with the breeze
Girl, I can change your life with the club night
Leave all your stress here at home, girl, you know I'm international

[Outro]
Come here, girl (come here, girl)
Come here, girl (come here, girl)
Come here, girl (come here, girl)
Come here, girl (come here, girl)
Come here, girl (come here, girl)
Come here, girl (come here, girl)
Come here, girl (come here, girl)
Come here, girl (come here, girl)
I'm international
I'm international
