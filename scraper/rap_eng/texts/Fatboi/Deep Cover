[Verse 1: Jason Caesar]
You gon' make me do something I don't wanna do
And tell your man I done smashed first night at the W
I met you playing hard to get and you made him wait
So if you mention me, it may intimidate

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Caesar]
I still got those pictures in my phone
I, I still got those pictures in my phone
So watch what you say to me 'cause you never know
No, no, no, you never know

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
You a deep cover, a ghost from the past
I'm a secret lover, she came on so fast
You a deep cover, girl, I had a blast
I'm a undercover brother

[Verse 2: Jason Caesar]
Your boyfriend number two
Does he know what we do
And how you be falling through?
I bet he's cheating, too
All my flowers that I've sent, now they're dead and gone
But those voicemails that you left live on

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Caesar]
I still got those pictures in my phone
I, I still got those pictures in my phone
So watch what you say to me 'cause you never know
No, no, no, you never know

[Chorus: Jason Caesar & Laws]
You a deep cover, a ghost from the past
I'm a secret lover, she came on so fast
You a deep cover, girl, I had a blast (punk-ass motherfucker)
I'm a undercover brother

[Verse 3: Laws with Jason Caesar]
I wear my sunglasses when you were trying to chill your punk-ass man
Mam√≠ ice cold and I'd put that on anything
She ain't even taking off her wedding ring
I take her when she trying to get it in
She call them home videos, I call them evidence
And now it's evident, she ain't feeling dude like a lesbian
Plus she got a lot of rude, sexy friends
This could be something special
Work your back out, hook, I get to
And I just might
Unless you lean over and put your face down, like, 'guess who?'
I took pics so we can see
Any different type of freak that we can be
You had a hold on my heart like EMT
Act slick and I'm calling up TMZ

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
You a deep cover, a ghost from the past
I'm a secret lover, she came on so fast
You a deep cover, girl, I had a blast
I'm a undercover brother
You a deep cover, a ghost from the past
I'm a secret lover, she came on so fast
You a deep cover, girl, I had a blast
I'm a undercover brother
