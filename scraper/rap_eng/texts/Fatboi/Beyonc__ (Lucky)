[Verse 1]
How come when I'm at the gym, you're on the couch?
How come when I'm running laps, you running your mouth?
Don't listen to them songs that Beyoncé singing
They ain't about you
I be out here hustling and on my grind
You think you can do better than me, you out your mind
You take advice from your girlfriends who are single
And you can be, too

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm saying, "Look at you, look at me"
You say you can do better, I say, "Bitch, please"
You already out of your league, out of your league
Out of your league

[Chorus]
Girl, you got lucky
You must've had your fingers crossed, smoking on a four leaf clover
Girl, you got lucky
You must've had a horseshoe over your door
You got lucky
You must've had a terrible past life, so you better act right
You got lucky
You were reaching for the stars and you got one
Don't let it go

[Verse 2]
Chicks be pushing up, like, everyday
You say dudes be chasing you, too, and hey, that's okay
If they wanna deal with your ass, they can have you
Fine by me
But them dudes you really need ain't like these girls
I'm attracting all the chicks around the world
You're jumping out the frying pan and into the fire
Baby, you gon' see

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm saying, "Look at you, look at me"
You say you can do better, I say, "Bitch, please"
You already out of your league, out of your league
Out of your league

[Chorus]
Girl, you got lucky
You must've had your fingers crossed, smoking on a four leaf clover
Girl, you got lucky
You must've had a horseshoe over your door
You got lucky
You must've had a terrible past life, so you better act right
You got lucky
You were reaching for the stars and you got one
Don't let it go

[Verse 3]
If I gotta upgrade you, I can just trade you
You bush league, I balls in the majors
You can ride out like I ride this beat
Half your girls and they wanna ride me
Never should've had me in the first place
Got you a home run, but I'm still sitting on first base
We gon' see what happens when you strike out
You drop them keys, you can go on ahead and get the bike out
If you call yourself a diva
Baby, I'm not a believer
You will never conquer Caesar
You can lean into the speaker
To make sure you hear me clearly
I'm not threatening, I'm merely stating facts
Matter of fact, pack your bags
That's a wrap

[Chorus]
You must've had your fingers crossed
Smoking on a four leaf clover
You must've had a horseshoe over your door
(You gon' get lost listening to your friends, girl)
You must've had a terrible past life (and you gon' find yourself)
So you better act right (find yourself by yourself)
You were reaching for the stars and you got one

[Outro]
You got lucky
I say, you got lucky
You must've done something in the past life to make you deserve me
I'm attracting all the chicks around the world
Don't mess up a good thing
(Don't listen to them songs that Beyoncé singing
They ain't about you)
