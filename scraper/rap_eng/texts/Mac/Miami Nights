[Intro: Uncle Dane]
Uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Miami Nights, uh
Sawmill, getting the kills
Uh, haha
Yo, nice hat
Yo, nice hat
Check it out
Uh

[Verse 1: Uncle Dane]
Hey it’s me, your Uncle and it’s time to throw down
Cause we talking ‘bout the best effect around
We ain’t talking ‘bout Cloud 9 or purple/green confetti
It the unusual effectti that you’ll never forgetti
I’m talkin’ green, blue, purple, yellow waving lights
And it goes by the name of Miami Nights
And when I roll up to the server everyone goes insane
All the Medics overheal me as they say “Hi, Dane.”
But I really can’t blame ‘em 'cause this hat is the best
And every night I thank GabeN for being truly blessed
For the opportunity to wear such an effect
That makes my foes sit and sputter as they get they ass wrecked
No, it really can’t compare
And I really don’t care what the traders all say
That it’s relatively low tier
'Cause to me
It’s all that I need
I got the best damn hat that you ever did see

[Chorus: Uncle Dane & Mac]
There’s a party on the server and it’s on my head
You can see it in the kill cam when you’re dead
I love my Miami
Amo, a mi Miami
The effect that you see
When you’re filled with lead
You can see it in the kill cam
When you’re dead
I love my Miami
I love my Miami

[Verse 2: Uncle Dane]
Yo, I heard Burning Flames ain’t nothing to mess with
But I can’t see a flame in my game, I bring the pain
With my own brand of shimmer, you quiver
You realize that you're dinner for my sentry gun, you having fun?
You better be
'Cause I’m breaking the economy
Making Miami Nights a great again
I’d rate it a 10
And I'd give it a kiss every now and then
Can a man fall in love with a hat?
Well I’m not sure, but I’ll check with the court
Until then I’m playing Team Defense Fort
Two
And I’ll be sporting Miami Nights, haha
How about you?

[Chorus: Uncle Dane & Mac]
There’s a party on the server and it’s on my head
You can see it in the kill cam when you’re dead
I love my Miami
Amo, a mi Miami
The effect that you see
When you’re filled with lead
You can see it in the kill cam
When you’re dead
I love my Miami
I love my Miami
