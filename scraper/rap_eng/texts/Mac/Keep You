[Hook]
And I promise I will be there, you know I will
And I promise I will be there, you know I will
And I promise I will be there, you know I will
And I promise I will be there, you know I will

He's not a healer, he's a pain
But I can be the one to make it better
Like a cloud baby, he's the rain
But I can be the one to change the weather

So go out and dry your eyes
There's no more tears to cry
It's just about you and I, forever (yeah)

And I know your trust is broken in two
Even though your trust is broken in two
Girl I promise I will do, whatever I can do
To keep you (oh oh)

[Chorus]
Keep you
I promise to keep you
I will keep you
I promise to keep you

I know he hurt you, like a knife
But I can be the one to bring you back to life
He's a cheater, he's a liar
But you can trust me when I say that I'll treat you right

So go out and dry your eyes
There's no more tears to cry
It's just you and I, forever

[Hook]

I will, I will

And I know your trust is broken in two
Even though your trust is broken in two
Girl I promise I will do, whatever I can do
To keep you

[Chorus]

Girl I promise I will do, whatever I can do
To keep you

Hook]

I will
