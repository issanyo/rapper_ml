[Verse 1, Frank]

You gotta pay the troll toll, if you wanna get into that boy's hole! You gotta pay the troll toll to get in!

You want the baby boy's hole, you gotta pay the troll toll. You gotta pay the troll toll to get in!

[Chorus, Frank]

Troll toll!

[Dennis]

What'd you say!?

[Frank]

Troll toll!

[Mac]

Hey hey hey!

[Frank]

Troll toooooooooooll!
