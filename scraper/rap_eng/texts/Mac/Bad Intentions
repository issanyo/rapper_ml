[Intro: Ric Flair]
You’re talking to the Rolex wearing
Diamond ring wearing
Kiss stealing (WHOO!)
Wheelin dealin’
Limosuine riding
Jet flying
Son of a gun

[Verse 1: Mac]
I never stop now
I'm off the clock
I'm going off now
Cause I'm the boss now
Never going soft wow
Always showing off how
I got the girly's on broad taking their tops down
Tittes [?]
They all hold the crown
Party downtown
And the boozes I'm surely finna drown, drown
On the floor, face down
Girly got her ass out
No doubt I'm finna smash
Until we fucking pass out
Leaving no doubt
We got the most clout
Above the most clouds
We smoke the most loud
In the club we finna show out
We never hold out
Got the money, got the hoes now
You better watch out, cause this is our time now
We finna blow now

[Verse 2: Figo]
Hold up my nigga shoota alert
You been a bitch ever since
But I came from the dirt
You don't even now your worth
[?]
I drop your name on the track
And I swear that it hurt (ayy)
Stop, drop, I'm tossing it up
I ain't never taking losses, now I'm catching this dub (ya)
Fuck this club, then I bounce like [?]
Better shut the fuck up before I'm in your cup bruh (ayy)
You a [?]
All these actors, these motherfuckers don't matter
I just worry about you after
Then carry on with my chatter
Eat up, eat up, like a platter
Smoking weed up
Smoking shatter
People saying that I'm a hazard
Say "nah nigga I'm a bastard"

[Verse 3: Cross Sauv]
Light it up, Light it up
Light it up, Light it up
Niggas smoke fire
Smoking like [?]
Load it up, Load it up
Niggas they lying [?]
Spaced out like NASA
Hole in your head, ray beam with the plasma
You need to start asking, "Where the hoes at?"
They traveling with SAUV
Got niggas in windows
23 strap, look like a [?]
Check the extendo
I am playin yall niggas, just like Nintendo
[?]
Shake up the clip, pop you with Mentos
I'm running this train hoe
Bitches like zombies
Crawling on Kino
I'm moving the shadows
Ice on my wrist, power like Thanos

[Outro: Ric Flair]
And I'm having a hard time holding these alligators down
(WHOO!)
