2017 (The Dedication)

Verse 1

I got freckles on my heart
I've been jealous from the start
I got issues with relationship like families apart
Switching demons on regular these bitches won't understand
The price a brother gotta pay in private
The rituals
Been fixing the puzzle
Got the last nail for the coffin
And milk for the coffee
Some blues for relaxation of muscles
King of hearts
Messy like politicians and virgins
This' my resurection, a piece of my mind for the locket
Cos I've been waiting too long
Soaking up this pressure with Nikki and two blondes
They prey on my position cos baby we two wrongs
Tryna make it right together, Siamese twins in class
So you know I still belong to everything that we believe in
Do you still believe in me?
Yeah
I mean it's been a while I heard those tiny lips recite my name and laugh to every time I giggle on the telephone
Now I ain't even got a telephone
And i'un gotta tell no phony story bout how much I miss you baby
And pay the radio stations to make it a public statement
Then maybe
Replays on daily rewards me a new Mercedes
And helps me replace your base to the birth place of our babies
Please forgive my pride
Felt good seeing your message fucked me up inside
And when you do remember what you were about to ask
Put it in a message
Been a blessing
You've been alive and well
Yeah

Verse 2
See I ain't tripping if you want a badman
I ain't tripping if you want a badman
But I'm sorry I'm a gentleman
And happiness could take a man's life
If we never look back at Lot's wife
So it's only right you know that I ain't tripping if you want a badman
I ain't tripping if you want a badman
And I apologise for every time I took you for a fool
And I'll always take you over a fool
Let's get along again
Unlike before
So now it's take you off the fence and then slowly prepare the leather couch
Spread your wings and take you on that trip with me to Neverland
Because you take my breath away
And I just wanna see you smile again and lemme hold you close
Defy the odds, deny the cross, revive the horse
Or buy the corpse a pretty box and just hide my flaws
Cos I've been focused on the cars
And now it's driving us apart
Been rocking designer pants
Just to make 'em take they' pants off
And your pockets' a replica of whatever you are
So I can't afford all your happiness if I'm always around
And it's hard cos I dream big on Christopher Wallace's bed
And just one look in your eyes leaving all my troubles to death
I'm still uncertain
Got problems with dates of birth and lessons
I never get to learn and it's fucking my blessings up
When it's pity in place of titles
From rickety looking rivals
I hope you get enlightened
I like you
