Well, it's like this player
You know, it's either we all strapped
Cause if we ain't somebody goin die
We roll on this side and they roll on our side
It's like a never ending game
And whoever left, that's who wins
So check it out player

Everybody's going trigger happy, wanting to blast
I remember we used to play ball and cut class
Now my niggas sport bulletproofs, clutching their gat
We all headed for hell, my grandmama told me that
Even now I'm going shell shocked, wanting to shoot
I was a little cool nigga to tell you the truth
They put the gats in the ghetto, them rotten motherfuckers
Wanted us to get frusterated and kill one another
Now we all beefing and it won't stop till we all sleeping
Everybody's got to die but why we point the finger at the white man
Nigga it's us killing us late at night man
So now I ask my God, is this the way of the world or just the hood niggas
My auntie said, Mac what happend to the good niggas
Am I a fool cause my heart be true
And I give a fuck about you and you
But they don't hear me

[Ms. Peaches]
When them niggas ride on you
You turn around and ride on me
Tell me what you gonna do, it's genocide
When them niggas ride on you
You turn around and ride on me
Tell me what you gonna do, it's genocide

[Mac]
Flowers in the soap saying I felt pain
Through the eyes of the youth I envision your gain
My nigga Eric was young when he was caught up in the drama
Them niggas took his life right in front his baby mama
Was that God or the devil, that shit is so deep
It's hard to dig it with a shovel, now we on that other level
That's the tale of the ghetto, never change with the name
It's a constant war, nobody wins, everybody pains
Everywhere they hating
They got me sporting camoflauge when I'm misled, preparing on the armageddon
And everybody to blame for the supplies
To the vibes, little kids they caught up in the crossfires
Is this the way of the world or just the hood niggas
My auntie said, Mac what happend to the good niggas
Am I a fool cause my heart be true
And I gave a fuck about you and you
But they don't hear me

[Ms. Peaches]
When them niggas ride on you
You turn around and ride on me
Tell me what you gonna do, it's genocide
When them niggas ride on you
You turn around and ride on me
Tell me what you gonna do, it's genocide
