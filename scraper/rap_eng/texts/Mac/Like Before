Mac talking:

And I put that on my life nigga
It's 1999 niggas
Look lets make it like before
It's World War
Once again on these....

Verse 1: (Mac)

We been together for awhile, I'm diggin' your style
You sorta wild, but fragile, with a slugged smile
Lookin' like you ain't been plugged up in awhile
That's how I met you, comtplating on how I could get next to you
If you was mine I would never leave you, that's what you agreed to
Never meant to mislead you, believed you
When you told me you would make it all work
Plus when you said it you was sportin' a mini- skirt
Nowa days I'll we do is fuss, I'll we do is cuss
I'll we do is fuck, we don't even make love
I hate it when we fight like I hate a fake thug
In the process you kinda made me wanna escape love
As of tonight, I wanna make it right, wanna make just like the first night
When it felt so right, you held me tight
Told me you would be there for the stretch and I said the same
Now stop playin' games

Chorus: (Mac)
And I don't wanna fight no more
We just can't seem to make it right no more
Your love, I couldn't tell you what it's like no more
Baby let's make it like before (let's make it like before)
And I don't wanna fight no more
We just can't seem to make it right no more
Your love, I couldn't tell you what it's like no more
Baby let's make it like before (let's make it like before)

Verse 2: (Storm)

At times it seems like we don't belong together
And at the same time it seems like we meant for each other
I'm stressin', cause after so long we been in this struggle
If worse comes to worse, you know I'm there for you cause I love you
Nothing's changed, in your driving range
And if money could buy love your spending chump change
The house, the car, the money, jewlery, and clothes
Really don't matter to me, it wasn't there before
If you know like I know, you better step it up and show me something
Cause all this fighting and fussing, it don't amount to nothing
It's hard times, and alittle more lies
Baby just tell me what you feel inside, and we can ride the tides
This is my heart, you playin' with my life
See fucking hoes is your thing so you don't need a wife
Cause when Storm is feed up,  I'm pissin' on you
Shittin' on you, and if you cross again bitch, I'm spittin' on you

Chorus: (Mac)
And I don't wanna fight no more
We just can't seem to make it right no more
Your love, I couldn't tell you what it's like no more
Baby let's make it like before (let's make it like before)
I don't wanna fight no more
We just can't seem to make it right no more
Your love, I couldn't tell you what it's like no more
Baby let's make it like before (let's make it like before)

Verse 3: (Mac)

When I'm alone in my room,  sometimes I stare at the wall
Just waitin' on your call, anticpating, pentrating your draw
It used to be a drug to me, makin' love to me all night
Had me feeling like it was all right
I know I'm wrong, most times we on the phone
Arguing about how long or when I'm comin' home
I never meant to hurt you or make you cry
Forgive me for calling you a lie, killing your pride
Know you down for me, slang your ground for me
Let off a couple of rounds for me, when they over- stepping their boundaries
And it's real to me when we walking and talking
I made it possible for you to be parking the big cars
Sportin' these fine jewls and it's cool, we can't lose
$200 dollars shoes, it's real to me
You feel that look, let's go ahead and walk these dogs
And stop all this fighting, ya heard me?

Chorus: (Mac)
And I don't wanna fight no more
We just can't seem to make it right no more
Your love, I couldn't tell you what it's like no more
Baby let's make it like before (let's make it like before)
I don't wanna fight no more
We just can't seem to make it right no more
Your love, I couldn't tell you what it's like no more
Baby let's make it like before (let's make it like before)
And I don't wanna fight no more
We just can't seem to make it right no more
Your love, I couldn't tell you what it's like no more
Baby let's make it like before (let's make it like before)
I don't wanna fight no more
We just can't seem to make it right no more
Your love, I couldn't tell you what it's like no more
Baby let's make it like before (let's make it like before)

Now want you break a nigga off, break a nigga off
Break a nigga off, break it off
You gotta a nigga rock hard, a nigga rock hard
A nigga rock hard, now take it off

Now go to war with me, Now go to war with me
Now go to war with me, Now go to war with me
