[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
What it do?
Rich gang
It's your boy Juve the great
Stupid money in this bitch
Yeah
Na na na na na na na (x3)

[Verse 1: Juvenile]
Open up the vault, it's an areal assault
When you make it out together, [?] is the result
Pockets full of money, make it hard for me to walk
Blame it on myself, it's only me that I can fault
Livin' in the gulf where the water's full of salt
And the niggas die before they old enough to be adults
Back when I was younger I ain't even never spark
In my hopes of livin' good and havin' money was a thought
Glad that I'm survivin' all the fights that I done faught
Tomorrow's not a promise, live your life what I was taught
[?] tearin' us apart
I might have taken risks, I pray to God I don't get caught
No

[Hook]
Mmm, mmm, na na na na na
Rich gang
Right now, right now, right now (x3)
Goin' down in this bitch right now

[Verse 2: Icewear Vezzo]
[?] you wouldn't believe I didn't get caught
When you get it out the money [?]
Never seen a nigga from the D full of frost
So clean [?] 20 G's up in my cars
Mamma told me "son don't let a nigga throw you off"
Have some motherfuckin' pride never give a bitch your heart
I'm stackin' up this cash 'til my shit up in a vault
Bitch I got it off the [?] and I ain't need no fuckin' salt
Niggas wanna beef but they need to see the outcome
Rest in peace C I wish he could see what I done
A dream, where would I be without one?
Ain't fulfilled 'em yet, but at least a nigga got some
Yeah

[Hook]
