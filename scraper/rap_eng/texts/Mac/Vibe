Not imitating or intimidated
O220 gotta deeper meaning
Never typical young n***as from the hood claiming that they grindin'
Forever talking bout the struggle
While you living off your momma hard earned bread boy
You better watch your mouth
Think about what you gon' say
If you f**k around you'll get killed
Mess around around and get spilled

Yeah Homie that's real
