[Intro: Mac]
Yeah, yeah, big Mac and the B.G. nigga
You can't see me
It's like that for '96 y'all
U.P.T. connect
Keepin' it real
Give a nigga respect
It's like that

[Verse 1: Mac]
Feel the wrath of a soldier, the Crescent City Jesus
I pack a tre-deuce, got a army 'bout the size of Beruit
We hit 'em
Rugged even if it's unplugged for thug lifers
We be the niggas leavin' slugs in ya crime cipher
Got the town locked with underground stock
Around clock workers to serve us
Responsible for many murders
I left your town with all the gold pieces
Shoot the sheriff to assure my family's convict releases
Payin' witnesses to hold they breath
Non-cooperation is only death, and no this ain't a phony Tec
I'm in a limo full of blow niggas
But I'm never high 'cause a leader gotta be up on his toes nigga
A trail of cops is followin' we start to swallowin' the evidentials
Keep supplier's name confidential
Crooked cops started buckin' at us
We made a turn to a dead end, but froze 'cause the cops had us
I grab the Tec and started buckin' back
'Cause I'd rather take half the force out before they pump a slug in Mac
The head shot took me under
I fell on my back, the last see is his pale face and his badge number

[Verse 2: B.G.]
Came in the clear, slide it in, cock it back
Plot it out, I put me an extra one in
That's eighteen in the nine, I'm ready to discharge
That's eighteen for that ass, tryin' to play hard
Got the fat bullets, with the dent in the front
They get sent when you hunt when I bend from the blunt
Nigga don't let me get that first draw, and I'ma [?]
I'ma shoot'cha in the jaw first, then get some more
You know I bust heads, gotta jack it like a London Fog
I got the bulldog sendin' niggas to the mall
I send death threats, and then I fulfill 'em
Two hoes think they'll survive the trial bein' a witness but I'ma kill 'em
My nine milli' is the nigga on side of me
Hollow points is for devils that wanna follow me
Try to swallow me under Providence Memorial Park
I'm too smart to be caught, 'bout to snort what I just bought
Take a ride
With the chopper lookin' for the robber on the other side
I'm so high, and the motto Uptown is do or die
Let's make it happen, take it to action
Fuck rappin' I'm cappin', fuck yappin', gimme no dappin'
Pull out the strapin' and start bustin'
Show me you bout buckin' or duckin'
'Cause I'm sendin' 17 slugs I'ma thug
All about sellin' drugs, nigga you get plugged
Get out the way, of the race, it's a big paper chase
You get the taste of the choppa strikin' you in the face
Get out the way on the double, I bust ya bubble
I'm behind the trigga, so niggas in trouble

[Verse 3: Mac]
T-Shirts and white caprices, my Daddy used to call him Jonny
I never thought the snake muthafuckas would be behind me
They took a shot nearly blind me
My eyes rolled like a zombie, my life started seemin' timely
I can't believe it, Officer Friendly, he put a slug in lil' McKinley
I'll be a memory, but I ain't havin' it
Fightin' for my life, the people grabbin' it
Just enough strength to pull the trigga once more
I hit his cabbage and he dropped like the Valujet
I heard a nigga say he wasn't dead yet
They shouldn'ta have never said that
My life came back, like some supernatural shit
I stood up, and took the bullets they was hittin' me with
Grab the dead cocked Glock out the holster
Pointed at the rest of them and said muthafucka I'm a soldier
You can't kill me
They said we'll see
I said nigga feel me, and hit em with the nine milli', ya heard me?
I took my vest off, and threw it on the pavement
You never see the Mac's assassination, nigga it's like that

[Verse 4: B.G.]
Get out the way or get caught up in serious gun slangin'
'Cause the shit that I'm bringin' leave a busta brains hangin'
'CauseI ain't half steppin', when I come for the chop
I clock, meal, and rob, Black Connection is the mob
That I'm married to, TRU to life real niggas
Young niggas comin' down wit shit you could feel nigga
Peel niggas wig off, soft nigga play hard
But I see through you muthafucka I pull ya card
Representin' I war and die for this rap game
It's the only thing I know besides hustlin', so I do my thang
Done crossed the line with niggas I thugged with
We run blood out'cha body, nigga we thugs, shit
So give us respect because we comin' direct
Totin' Tecs through projects that leave a nigga wet
Baby Gangsta gat packer, watch my back for the jacker
Then Blacka tryin' to attack and release the ratta-tatta
Leavin' lifeless? No, never
I reverse the game in a double, I bubble
To overflow nigga, niggas in trouble
