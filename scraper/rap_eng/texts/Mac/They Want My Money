(Thug talkin to a Bitch)

[Chorus]
Bitches want my money
They want my time
All they gonna get
Is a dick up in they mouth

Bitches want my money
They want my time
[she only want the finer things]
All they gonna get
Is a dick up in they mouth

[C-Murder]
Now to all y'all gold-diggin' bitches
Tryin to fuck a nigga cause a nigga got riches
Dollar signs, yeah I see 'em in your eyes
Everything up out your mouth is a muthafuckin' lie
U's just like a black cat when I see you in my path
I get bad luck girl, you know you're down, beg
You say you want a Rolex, wan' brake a nigga off
Cause when I get the pussy I'ma leave you in the mall
You think you're in love but you're in love with my money
If I didn't have a dollar, bitch you wouldn't holler
So meet me at the 'tele, let me see what you're about
Cause all you gon' get is some dick up in your mouth
You dig...

[Chorus]

[Mia X]
First of, I can never have your dick in my mouth
You need tweezers just to pull the little fucker out
C you 'bout stuntin for them niggas when you know you get your sweat on
Down to put your face in my pussy, I call you 'tampon'
Crab on my style, call me up all day
But 5 minutes, so what
To watch you pre-ejaculate, you talk the tit's are fake
Yet you tryin to act bad
Fuck around and get a mouth full of (?)
Gimme the face cash, I ain't tryin to spend no time
You can kick it with your mama, I just want the dollars
Mia X's be makin show you niggas cum correct
I want it all from stole' money to the (?) cheques

[Chorus]
