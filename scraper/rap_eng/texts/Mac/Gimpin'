**Talking**
Mi puta, This what its all about huh, fucking and sucking
You piece of trash, Every gimp like you needs a pimp like me ok
You get on that fucking block and you make my money you piece of trash
Make my money right now, you get on that street and you look good
And you work good and you suck good ok

(Kane)
Dressed to impress like I'm slinging them birds
Put a bitch on pimp arrest as she keep her eyes to the curb
These ho's we don't need em, we let the welfare feed em
Hustlas pimp hoes for pussy let them fake bustas eat em
Mr. Kane, Mr. Magic, dog a bitch quick
Hit that trick from the back and let her suck my brother dick
We don't sweat these hoes, we let these hoes
Find em, fuck em, duck em and forget these hoes
I need fresh money everyday bitch have my cash
Try to short game or run game get shot in the ass
Understand you da hoe and I'm the pimp
All paper comes to me, see you the gimp
Put some stretchmarks on that pussy and fuck till you limp
When the sun goes down you gonna do it again

(Abel)
I started off two hoes on the block for me
Now its two hundred hoes wanna shop with me

Chorus: (Magic, Kane & Abel)

Look, I got a proposition every gimp needs a pimp
If you about gimpin' then we about pimpin
(repeat 4x)

(Big Ed)
It ain't nothing like black pussy on my dick
My tank dawgs said never put my faith in a bitch
All females ain't hoes, I love the ladies
But gimps get tag team freaks in backseats of jeeps
I'm that big dick nigga drivin up ya street
Big dick nigga got em going mouth to me
I'll hit ya in ya grill hole if you want it there
I'll even watch you eat your girl's pussy I dont care
I'll hit you from the back, slap your ass and pull your hair
Wrap around rub your clit through your pubic hairs
Women call me the assassin cause they know I'm gone kill it
I fuck your pussy so hard I make ya momma feel it

(Mac)
Now where the gimps, I slam em like Shawn Kemp
I guess I'm a born pimp cause I never eat it, still I complete it
My name Mac so motherfuckers know where my game at
I fuck em and duck, give em wrong numbers and what
Camouflage love all night making you moan
Yeah I get mine and I'm gone but I gotta go finish my song
Look you ain't gotta go home but you gotta leave
Now straighten up your weave
And call me soon as you make it to your crib please
And I'm gone give you a beep next time I want to creep
Wouldn't give a fuck if you sleep, wake up and greet its me
I like them thug girls yall can have them pretty hoes
Them giddy hoes ain't good for nothing but videos

Chorus 4x

No disrespecting my sisters, I'm disrespecting you bitches
Scandalous hoes sucking and fucking for a nigga's riches
Keep your hands out my pockets ho cause I'm a pimp
You can't play this fucking player thats why I treat you like a gimp
You ain't nothing but a fuck or two
So if you ain't got no cash then I really dont want your ass
I'm bout bigger and fucking better
If you really want me then bring the cheddar
And I promise you that you'll never need another fellow
Treat ya like daddy but be sure to call me Magic
And if I ever catch you stashing, girl I'm gone let you have
When a nigga call you, call me and I decide (hmmm...)
Whether this nigga deserves the pussy...trust me
Sign your name on the dotted line and if you ever need this nigga
Just call me I ain't hard to find

Chorus 4x

**Talking**
(Magic)
What you don't get it or something...
No limit carry nothing but pimps and motherfucking players
Know what I'm saying.  Tell em twin
(Kane)
Nigga these hoes like busses
You miss one you just catch another one ya heard me
Is that your pussy or is a catchers mitt?
Suck a dick bitch
(Magic)
Ol' stanky uncomfortable scallywag trifling ass ho
Hoes don't mean nothing to us
