[Verse 1]
I have never been a beautiful boy
Never liked the sound of my own voice
I wasn't cool when I was in my teens
I never slept but I did have dreams
As I step out in this big old world
Seven billion just trying to cope and
Everyone of us someday will die
But today I never felt more alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it, feel it, feel it?

[Chorus]
Running through your bones
Running through your bones
Yeah you set my heart on fire
And it's all hot wired to my bones

[Verse 2]
I can count all the things I fear
I close my eyes but they don't disappear
If there's a god then there's a guarantee
But if there's not it's just you and me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
So kiss me before the sun falls down
Run before your legs give way
Swallow it until you drown

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus: 2x]
