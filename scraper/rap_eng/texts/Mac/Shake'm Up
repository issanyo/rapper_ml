Nigga ride with me, ride with me, die with me, die with me
Kill with me, kill with me, bury me a soldier
Don't nobody cry, just keep my name in the sky
Tattoo me, retaliate on them niggas that do me
Back to life, this No Limit shit I represent that
You resent that, you meet my nigga dirty black, that's what I call the gat
Shell sheezie, ask my nigga B Neezie
Big Man, Big Champ, Big Hurt, don't make them killers go to work
]From the south to the east to the middle to the west
Represent your hood, show me where them killers at

No Limit soldier at heart, got TRU on my veins
Now it's tapes and CD's, used to be herion and cocain

[C-Murder]

Like a blast from my sawed off fool, ha, I'm deadly
Do you really wanna test me nigga, I said I'm crazy

Lives be drastic, these niggas be endin up in plastic
Shit is drastic, mad these niggas ain't laughin
And they wonder why a nigga like me keep on blastin
