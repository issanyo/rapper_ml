[Ghetto Commission]
I'm from the dirty south where niggas go to prison just by word of mouth
Slangin quarter keys to make them G's is what it's all about
I was brought up in the city of Gretna
Had nerve with that nigga Pepper
That's you gots to put pressure on me to make it so they test ya
I used to hang across that water
That mighty 9 and other sections
While louging in the club, I packed a snub nosed Smith and Wesson
Fuckin hoes, split the blunts and optimos, that's a war
These niggas out chea cut throat, so the crime rate never falling
It's a swamp nigga, we all ghost fuckin riders as we stunt niggas
That scrappin shit ain't happenin see you dead if yous a punk nigga
We floss around in Lexuses, from the boot to Houston, Texas
Any nigga that disrespect us, recieve a slug though they vest

I'm from where niggas end up lookin like funnels
When they crossin my tunnel
Left in bloody puddles, so it's a must, I represent my jungle
The bricks bitch, Marrero, where we ride slow
Go to war with Calicos, sendin niggas to thier burial
I'm tellin ya niggas'll be smellin ya, back at the canal
Niggas know we living foul with televised murder trials
We hustle, duckin JP's in laced up Ree's
White T's, we keep our rocks in the same place we keep our teeth
We meet at club James, known for blood stains
Niggas stay in front of Tina's, get caught up in the game
Nigga Chateau the's Place, back of Ames, and the Villa
Betty street, Garden road, Westbank, home of killers

[Mac]
From the eastbank to the westbank, it's our thing
From the third ward to the ninth ward, it's our thing
It's a N.O. thing, an N.O. thing, an N.O. thing
Throw your hood up and claim nigga, it's an N.O. thing

[Ghetto Commission]
Let me tell you about them boys in the fifteenth ward
Look they ain't playin
Any altercation with the enemy in they vicinity, they sprayin
When you see them niggas with the white hankerchiefs
You get to the land of the lost
Cause these niggas bout they paper, bout they come up at any cost
Many niggas done got killed on the battlefield of McClendon Ville
Ya ain't even gotta question, if these Christopher Homes soldiers real
They knockin nuts off back in the cutoff, them niggas bout it too
You doubt it, go test em, you can be another bloody body too
If I was you I'd keep my tool slippin round them Fischer Fools
Darkside, lightside, both sides, fuck, homicide rules
Them boys over the hump poppin trunks if you gettin outta line
Algiers niggas packin that iron, respect our fuckin mind

[Magic]
Now all you hear is ninth ward this, nigga ninth ward that
It's Mr. Magic, puttin my fuckin hood on the map
You wanna die motherfuckers cause you're fuckin with G's
You dig your own fuckin grave when your fuckin with these
So where my niggas at, throw your fuckin nine in the air
Respect my mind, I represent it, like I just don't care
Desire and Galvez, nigga Dauphine and Flood
Be the only motherfuckers ever show me love
It's cause of me ninth ward comin up like a storm
So when you see me identify me by the nine on my arm
And if I die motherfuckers better sound the alarm
City under siege, Clinton couldn't stop this bomb

[QB]
Fuck with us you gettin slapped, only way survive the gun jam
Third ward, parkway, all the way, AK Spray, now tell me who's the baddest
The click I roll with will leave you in the basement
Call your mama, tell her make a replacement
That's 9 months she wasted
No years I be facing in the crescent
Tryin to teach an adolescent, fuck them niggas I'm suggesting
You keep ya mouth closed, before ya body wind up with holes
Exploding blows, with blood all over your clothes

[Mac]
Check it
I'm camoflauged motherfucker, I'm bustin at they click
I make moves and keep these boss bitches up on my dick
Been camoflauged up, ever since a young buck
I hit the scene like nigga what, do anybody wanna fuck
With this murda murda killer, blood spiller with rhyme
Or I cut your life short like my part in the last don
So much of a soldier even drove a tank to my prom
Affiliated with crime like you affiliated with moms
Nigga
That's it?
