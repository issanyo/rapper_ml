[Hook: Figo]
Eyes low moving slowly cause I'm [?]
Back, take a sip of the Henny
I need some more
Pour it up
Got a 5th in my cup
I fuck it up
Take a snap
Now I'm ripped the club
They show me love

Eyes low moving slowly cause I'm [?]
Back take a sip of the Henny
I need some more
Pour it up
Got a 5th in my cup
I fuck it up
Take a snap
Now I'm ripped the club
They show me love

[Verse 1: Mac]
Walking around with my eyes low I'm zoning
People ask me "If I'm high"
Tell them "Ya I'm smoking"
I'm blowing green
Chasing commas
Trying to ride in limousines
See my face on MTV and magazines
Catch subs like all the Tweets
YouTube comments and [?]
That stem from hate and enemies
We not commenting felonies
We got a different destiny
Dreams I'm chasing heavily
My life might change up in a week
I smoke a bowl to keep my peace
My eyes low been stoned all week

[Hook: Figo]
Eyes low moving slowly cause I'm [?]
Back take a sip of the Henny
I need some more
Pour it up
Got a 5th in my cup
I fuck it up
Take a snap
Now I'm ripped the club
They show me love

Eyes low moving slowly cause I'm [?]
Back take a sip of the Henny
I need some more
Pour it up
Got a 5th in my cup
I fuck it up
Take a snap
Now I'm ripped the club
They show me love

[Verse 2: Mooch]
See me
[?]
So they see me sittin' on the sofa
As they kick my eyes roll back over
Like they never thought they see me growing older
Stories of my mom be crying on my farthers shoulder
It's like this life is a dream
But then what's between
Too obscene to speak about
But what could that mean
Back with the team, catching in
[?]
With the pint and the keys
Pass me the sprite and the drink
Turning that lime into pink
Easing my mind to think
[?]
Ziploc top shelf
I need, no help
I deal with, what I'm dealt
I feel, what he felt
Velvet, runaways
I got, that gold belt
