Huh!
Ha!
Yea
(Lets go get this bitch ass nigga)
Let me tell you a little story about...
About this nigga I knew...
This nigga I knew...
Jus-Just...

Look

(Chorus)
You was my nigga, now we beefin'
Im bustin' at you
You bustin' at me
And it won't stop till we both sleepin'

(It's world war nigga)
(Check this shit out)

Chorus

[Verse 1]
We was claimin' the same hood
Fucked the same bitches (same bitches)
And they knew
If I hit it, you had to hit it too
We was crew
You was with me when I first pulled the trigger
You tried to shoot too, but your gun jammed
So we pulled off..ya remember?
I hid by your mama house for a couple of days
Cause the niggas we was beefin' with knew where I stayed
We were some down south niggas
Bootin' 'em out niggas
The wrong route niggas...
Typical niggas
We just nickel and dime it
Sellin' weed...to the needy
Everything be 50-50
Ain't no need for being greedy
You my dogg, huh? (For sho' bro)
So thats how we played it
Niggas who hated...
We rushin' them and demonstrated
While we ain't to be faded
On this mission to get money, power, and bitches
Or whatever come along with these riches
That's if nobody snitches
I'd do a BID for ya
Take care of your KID for ya
But damn!
Look what these pussy niggas done did to ya

[phone rings]
(chorus in the background during the talking)

-Hello??
-Yeah, nigga, whats happenin'?
-Whats happenin' with ya dogg?
-Nigga, whats happenin' with you nigga?
Talking about you got some beef with me nigga
-Beef wit' you? Nigga you know I'm a real nigga
If I had some beef with you
I'd come to you like a man dogg...It ain't like that between us
See what it is, is...
You talkin' to these niggas...and these niggas got you goin'

[Verse 2]
Them niggas told you I blew up
And I forgot about us
The same niggas who was with you and afraid to bust
How could you listen to these niggas?
When they mean no good
Mothafuckers ain't even from our hood
And know you snortin' furl with 'em
Off in that world with 'em
And Father forgive him
He dance to some other rhythm
Ever thought that we could work it out?
We would meet
But as long as you with them niggas
I'll be with that heat
And thats deep
Cause I made a promise to your mama when we was only 12
I'll deliver you from evil and keep you alive and well
Guess I gotta disappoint her
But you leave me no choice...
Callin' my crib, with this murder-murder tone in your voice
What...I'm a bitch or somethin'?
I used to fight for ya
Used to let you stay at my mama crib
When shit jsut wasn't right for ya
Look what you do me in return...
I guess I played with fire
So eventually it burns
Nigga

(chorus in the background)
-Hello? Hello?
Man this nigga done fuckin' hung up on me
Y'all think that nigga serious?

Chorus

It's world war nigga
