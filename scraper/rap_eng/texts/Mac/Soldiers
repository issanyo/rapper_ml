You could tell I'm a soldier by my army fatigues
And you could I'm a killer by the way a nigga bleed
Forever TRU I'm gone roll to your motherfuckin' city
If I come to a show I've got a hundred thugs with me
Scream No Limit cuz I'm in it I represent it

Luteinent of a label full of soldiers nigga

Huh nigga what we soldiers

When your gone blows have the tank up on your lawn
Was born to bust out niggas protectin' my people
Ain't no sequel blastin' and rappin' and my fool and I'm lethal
They gone understand how to keep us so planned
And how the fuck we stay on billboards more than the marbolo man
We soldiers

Huh nigga what we soldiers

[Mac]
And to them fake soldiers below the street lights
We watch them die holdin' their riches and they bitches
Diggin' up ditches for the snitches in this ghetto
Will it happen makin' some white rappin' checkin' out my toes
Tell my hoes I never rest 'til they murder my foes
When a cop done shot when a cop done dug and I watched
Them bullets snatch me lookin' at my camoflauge
Makin' sure they didn't blast me
When I die bury me in my camoflauge cuz I'll be down with
My thug motherfuckers other niggas ride 'til its over
We gone live and breath soldiers

[Mia X]
I'm still on more times tryin' pay the bills with ryhmes
Criminal thoughts makes my nine in the picture much clearer
Its the biggest diva mama cat off the top
Open shot on your block and drop the shit your system's got
What no limit soldiers kickin' up dust in your face
Rowdy rowdy when we march in the place we face
None nigga don't you ever come fucked up
Tryin' stun off flex you get more hoes than a hair net

Drama regulator lyrical lady alligator

Huh nigga what we soldiers

Big Ed is a captain atain hut sloute carry on as you were
Gettin' rowdy with the tank dawg troops

[Kane & Abel]
When the tank roll up its like ten bombs blown up
My military comrads don't give a single solitary fuck
Pull the gat off the shelf niggas gone shit on they shelf
My warriors want more war mentality drug dealin'
Fatality fuck your feelings use my gun for proficent killings
