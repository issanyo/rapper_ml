[Intro: Big Mac]
They can't hang, they can't hang
They can't hang yeah it's ya boy Big Mac
On the track with Tha Mac motherfucker
This is the attack

[Hook: Big Mac]
It don't matter cause we the boss
Leaving motherfucking haters in the loss
Ya know why they on the bottom of the map hey
They on the bottom of the map 2x

[Verse 1: Big Mac]
They on the bottom of the map they can't hang
They hanging so low like the piece on my chain
I'm trying to get that million dollars
Like Lil Wayne I point guard every dollar
I'm running down the court throwing up K.N.E.W.P.O.R.T
My rhymes go so long yeah they never short
I bring the pain (pain) I bring the heat (the heat)
Done wrecked on so many beats you can call me a freak
Because of my bro I'm inspired
So when I wreck on other rappers they get expired
In this game I'm putting haters to shame
Whatever they got is now what I claim
Mane ya'll need to step ya'll game up
I'm with that K.N.E.W.P.O.R.T. E-N-T baby that's what's up
Yeah I'm putting it down putting competition underground
I'm just kicking haters out the side of my town

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Tha Mac]
Ya'll on the bottom of the map we on top it don't stop
Industry on lock you don't like me get your Glock
I'll melt it every rhyme I drop they felt it
I got more green than a motherfucking Celtic
That's weed, that's money, that's drank and paint
Don't let your girl see me that skank will faint
I can't complain how we run it look it ain't a thang
It ain't a man around that has an ounce of my brain
Bouncing to The Game The Doctor's Advocate
Dollars handle it competition the fuckers are absent
Niggas still acting I'm the Zen Master like Phil Jackson
Niggas getting krunk I kill with no effort still relaxing
Bills I'm grasping K.N.E.W.P.O.R.T. Entertainment is what's happening
This ain't no Rerun but we one and we run Houston
Chunking up the deuce and success is what I'm choosing
Where's my ruler I'm The Ruler yeah you niggas is losing

[Hook 2x]
