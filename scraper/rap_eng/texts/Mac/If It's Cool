Verse 1 (Mac) :

Girl look
Fuck your man and them niggas he be hanging with
Niggas he be slangin with, me I'm on some banging shit
Strictly, now  you with me or you wasting my time
And time is valuable
Especially when you looking at it through this perpetual
Now how you love that, I nothing nice with the ice
Me without the mic is like the Orients with no rice
But look fuck that let's take a walk to where my truck at
All I wanna do is talk I ain't got to touch that
But thats game, before you know it she callin my name
Runnin round tellin bitches she my main trying to get some fame
And thats the game so you gotta respect that
And respect my mind too cause I could get you naked in seconds
Mac-a-deezy if you open up I'ma slide in easy
But if it's cheezy let me smack you
And call you all kind of bad words like bitch
And smack myself too for trying to get with ya
Should have knew you was stank
And all you wanted was the tank

Chorus: Mac ( Ms. Peaches)

I don't wanna be ya man
I wanna tap something if it's cool (It's Cool)
But if you not ask your girl what I asked you
And when she tell about the way I freaked her
Heres the number to my beeper
Look

I wanna tap something if it's cool (It's Cool)
But if you not ask your girl what I asked you
And when she tell about the way I freaked her
Here's the number to my beeper

Verse 2 (Mac) :

Check it, look

Then hit me on my hip and call me anytime don't even trip
I guarantee it will be your gladdest night without the pimp
I hope you not a noise maker, cause I live with moms
Her rooms right next to mine and she be home all the time

It's 7 o'clock now so you got some time
I don't like wine, no I don't wanna dine
But I hope you like it from behind, cause that's my time to shine

When I attact ya your big ol ass is what is what I got a knack for
So let me crack ya if it's cool, but if it's not then it is time to move
But before I excuse ask your girl what I asked you

But if you not ask your girl what I asked you

Verse 3 (Ms. Peaches) :

Look
Let me explain this before we go any further
I ain't really looking for a man it's another type of lover
I need, cause I got my own ends, my own benz
The only thing you can do for me nigga is be a fuck friend
Some of these niggas like to fall in love
Once they get a small taste of my voluptuous glove
I'm saying this cause I wanna keep it real with cha
And chill with cha, or even make a couple of mill with cha
Now if you ready to get down and dirty
I gonna hit you on your hip around lets say around 11:30
Sexy ass got me so anxious
Let me whipe you with this ghetto angel, baby don't be a stranger
Cause I like my niggas rock hard
And if you bout twirkin something nigga lets go to war
I'm trying to see how many times you can catch a nutt
So you can really see it's cool to fuck, nigga it's cool to fuck
I don't wanna be ya man
I wanna tap something if it's cool (It's Cool)
But if you not ask your girl what I asked you
And when she tell about the way I freaked her
Heres the number to my beeper
Look

I don't wanna be ya man
I wanna tap something if it's cool (It's Cool)
But if you not ask your girl what I asked you
And when she tell about the way I freaked her
Heres the number to my beeper
