[Chorus: Master P]
No Limit is the army and we the soldiers
It's an uptown thing boy, I thought I told ya
No Limit is the army and we the soldiers
It's an uptown thing boy, I thought I told ya
No Limit is the army and we the soldiers
It's an uptown thing boy, I thought I told ya
No Limit is the army and we the soldiers
It's an uptown thing boy, I thought I told ya

[Master P]
These converse is for battle and we straight soldiers
Big Boz is knocking teeth out cause we rollers
This game got me wicked, I don't play
Niggas got funk on the other side, and we spray
We drive through the 3rd Ward Calliope Projects
And drove through the other side niggas get straight checked
See I'm a killer I only ride with G's
And I used to be a hot boy but now I slang CD's
Am I right? Am I wrong? Tryin to protect my life
When these killers want me they gonna catch me one night
I don't play, we spray, on the game, they late
Get up it ain't over yet nigga, 'till judgement day

[Chorus]

[Mac]
They call me camoflague, your everlasting assassin
Three niggas wanna hear me flow and they bitches fiendin' for my passion
World War be my gospel, my environment is hostile
You don't want beef with me
Cause I come through with those deadly apostle
Tell me something have you ever seen the eyes of a tiger
A cold blooded motherfucker who just murder for hire
Represent the turf, 'till my opposite of birth
Bless my posse with a shirt
Shit it'll make a turn for the worst
And got them niggas on GT that would die for me
And some niggas in the Saint T that would ride for me
My little brother, Ghost catch him at school he a straight student
But at night he masked up, ready to tear that ass up

[Chorus]

[Pheno]
This for my niggas in the block tryin' to get on their feet
This for them jackers and them killers makin' moves on the streets
For my ill ass niggas, my trill ass niggas
My upstate niggas quick to kill ass niggas
My real niggas, surviving in this game since lil' niggas
Roadies and rovers on 20 inch niggas, tank niggas
Backing up to the bank niggas, we stank niggas
I'll you gotta do is bunt niggas

[Chorus]

[C-Murder]
I'm from the Calliope nigga that's the home of the killers
Ask Falloy and Wing about them 3rd Ward niggas
Leroy - he'll stick you for that plastic toy
Little Jimmie and LoLo will hit for your mo mo
Soldiers for life so you better think twice
Cause them uptown soldiers ain't nothing nice
For real nigga, you might get killed, so chill
Or your people gonna be reading your will, ya bitch you

[Silkk the Shocker]
You can tell by the look in my eye
I'm a soldier till the day that I die
Fuck 'em we keep it locked, all that heat we got we keep that shit hot
Nigga either creep with a block or either sleep in the rocks
Some niggas say watch your back cause these niggas in the hood is phony
My shit's for life, CPT tattooed the fucking hood on me
Made Man you don't want to start with us
3 niggas in the car stuntin', do yall really wanna go to war with us?

[Chorus]
