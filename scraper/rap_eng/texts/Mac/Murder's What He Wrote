Verse 1:
Realize the Real Lies through your Real Eyes,
Damn it's been a minute but I know time flies
I could hear the silent cries through all the Wind Chimes
Strive to prime time
Starve the doubted kind
I'm kind & doubted
Counting down &
This is what I've mounted
Gifted soul with cold intentions
On a quest to question the morals & lessons
Protected menace with adolescents from livin' reckless
1-7,
Live Free is what I tell the Senate
Nieve & mentally prepared for war
Genie in a bottle
Let it wash up on the Shore
Anonymous messages from subliminal truths
Big boy hitter
You can call me Babe Ruth
My mind is racing when I'm up in the booth

Chorus:
I heard money is the root to all evil
If that's the case
Let me give a call to Dr. Evil & get a kilo
To hit the c-note
Cause Murder's what he wrote. x2

Bridge:
Murder's What He Wrote
Murder's What He Wrote x2

Verse 2:
What do you do when you're feelin' the blues?
Experimenting drugs to see the hidden truths
Get lost in a mind full of panoramic views
Murderous rhythm when I'm singing these tunes
It'll all be over soon,
Flow Like Water.
Word to iLLpoE
Kamikaze bombers when we fuckin' your daughters
Five panel cause I got the Five Panel channels to redirect my prayers to the unlit candles
Religious conspiracies & a 3rd eye wink from the dankest weed
Sauced from the Golden Hennessy
Get lost in my thoughts
I just hope as time goes on
You will all Remember ME

Chorus:
I heard money is the root to all evil
If that's the case
Let me give a call to Dr. Evil & get a kilo
To hit the c-note
Cause Murder's what he wrote. x2

Bridge:
Murder's What He Wrote
Murder's What He Wrote x2
