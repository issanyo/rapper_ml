Intro

[Verse 1: Papa J. Ruiz]

Remember vivid pictures?
Dyin' of thirst while they're drinkin' out of pitchers
Acting like the're broke, but I know the business
I keep my mouth shut, grind out, no bitchin'
Cause the ones that set you up
Are the ones from the trenches
I am a mind blowin' novacane
Reminisce of nowadays
Feeling like is over, hey
Load up the double barrel
Suicidal [?] to Kobain
...........
Same clothes for 4 dayz
...........
Rejected, projected to my eye
Giving dwell like I was [?] [?]
Bad [?] for [?] rappers diabetics
Snatch what I want when they tell me I can't get it
I'm knowin' this when I hear it
The devil tell me pull the trigger
Get a blunt and smir it
Dear my dearest love
I pray to God you hear this
All eyez on me
Ready to die
I channel 2 spirits
I know I met the greatest man when I look in the mirror

[Hook]

So hold on, I know I've been bout it
So long, when the covers hate what they want
Now tell 'em so long
I tell 'em so long
I put my life on the front line pinal
I don't know about your life pinal
But I, I can tell you I've been about it
I've been about it
Yeah, I've been about it
Yeah, I've been about it

[Versi 2: Papa j. Ruiz]

Now look into my pupil
Beyond the continent me running from the []
You suckass, bustass, cock sucker, motherfucker
Said thet I was [?]
But I am the future
Never kind to be really bust a ruga
