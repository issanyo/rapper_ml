Master P(O'Dell):
Ya know what(I miss you)
Its' like, uh?  How many times(I really miss my homies)
We must go through this how many records we gotta make like this
(I miss you) but ya know what?
It seem like uh?  It's a never ending game
All right P(I miss you) to all the fallen soldiers out there
(I'm prayin for you homies)
And Big Ed, people, Cory Green(I miss you) rest in peace

Big Ed:
I'm fightin tears back, the lord knows it hurts
All my family dressed in black, cause a love one rising to ???
Reminising on good times, some bad times too
But i gotta keep on smiling cause he would want me to
But it's hard to accept this loss
It's drivin me crazy, see my aunty suffer the death of her only male baby
(Be strong)
I'm at your funeral strapped, ready to kill
I look in the eyes of my new born and they told me to chill
I will always keep you with me
Cory can ya hear me
I feel cheated but to cope I keep, pourin out henney
Your youngest sister took it the hardest
Couldn't let go of your casket
Begging you to come back, times are gettin so drastic
I spoke at your funeral and broke all to peaces
Tears overflow from friends, nephews and nieces
Your girlfriends is pregnant, so you left your mark
And to al our memories I'll keep them close at heart

O'Dell:(x2)
I miss you
I really miss my homies
I miss you

Mac:
I remember we used to sit in class
We was either yappin bout rappin or lookin at some ass
Talkin bout one day we was going to make it in this rap game
Like normal teens we was young, black and broke
So all we had was dreams
You got a record deal and that's when everything changed
You started, hanging with the wrong niggas and thangs
I wasn't trippin when you saw me, I still smoke and say wooo
It's funny how you never really get a chance to say good bye
Cause you never know when they gone go
We was suppose to do ???
But I remember your last night
Some nigga told me Mac your boy, daddy all gone and I said ya right
Next day it was official(official), give me some tissue
I'm a G, but still I miss you
May God be with you

O'Dell:
I know it's a dream but I wish you could come back to me,homey(my homey)
But your long gone away, so I'm missin you
I miss you
I really miss my homies
I miss you
I miss you
I'm prayin for you homey
I miss you
(I miss you)I miss you
(I miss you)I really miss my homies
(I miss you)I miss you
(I miss you)(ohh ohh)
I miss you(ohh ohh)
I'm prayin for you homies(ohh ohh ohh)
I miss you(ohh ohh)
(Ohh ohh ohh)
