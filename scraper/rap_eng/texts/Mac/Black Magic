[Intro: Tha Mac]

[Verse 1: Tha Mac]
I don't police or politic I release the hottest shit
Got people bothered with the fact my niggas get powder flipped
And you can trust we make five for every dollar spent
By staying with those nickels and dimes but it's not a cent
We don't vote for President's we smoke that's our evidence
Been wilding ever since Mary J graced my presence
But that's not to blame not ashamed that I cock those thangs
Been a petty thief sold caine and took the Lord's name in vain
Listen mane many have been slained for monetary gain
People shouldn't die but we got to eat on the contrary mane
Since the seventh of January came I've been on this expedition
On this mission and it culminates with my ascension
To the throne it's known at this instant
My second is distant I passed you quick if you blinked you missed it
I'm persistent, consistent you boys nonexsistent
K.N.E.W.P.O.R.T. til I die I'm a represent it

[Hook: Big Mac]
No one can fuck with him police have tried at cuffing him
I got something that'll slow you down if you try rushing him
[Hook: Tha Mac]
No one is touching me destruction when I touch the beat
I'm in a zone on my throne it's M-A-C

[Verse 2: Tha Mac]
I'm rushing in impactful words that be crushing men
You need assault rifles then holler at those Russian men
In the Soviet my nigga I'm so legit
Without one record sold I already have a home and whip
Bank account swole fo' sho but I have mo' to get
I run H-Town like 50 and niggas know this shit
Well the rap scene my team control the drug scene
We our own bosses fuck employers and a drug screen
I keep promethazine on I-10 headed for New Orleans
To see Weezy Weez and support him through his time of need
Nevermind me just make sure my weed lime green
Mind at ease but it irks me we defined by words B
Or letters you either a G or a P (gangster or pussy)
A B or a C (blood or crip) an I or a D (you a dick)
I'm an emcee who is emotionally empty
Dead President's tempt me make ends I'm attempting

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Mac]
I'm just like Mac cause I release the hottest shit
Because I abuse the beat and fucking demolish it
Listen to the lyrics people say they wanna hear it
Well here it is on Black Magic bitch I'm ruling it
And I'm with K.N.E.W.P.O.R.T. so best believe I'm repping it
We trying to go #1 and be stacking it
And like the hook says no one is touching me
I'm in a zone on my throne it's Big M-A-C
Now check it I'm #1 like T-Mac
Throwed in the game just counting paper off my lap
Yeah that's what's good yeah that's what's great
K.N.E.W.P.O.R.T. go be #1 in all 50 States
Maybe the whole world the whole galaxy
I'm coming down repping K.N.E.W.P.O.R.T. can't you see
Yeah bitch so get it straight
Coming out of H-Town doing it big in 0-8

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tha Mac]
I feel like the best lyricist 2001 my genesis
Not Sega the beginning and end the alpha and Omega
It starts and ends with me in this industry
I'm in the streets and avoid dead ends endlessy
The hip hop prototype I could tell you what the doe doe's like
Classic album like Nas so I don't need foe moe mics
Moving slow mo right The Matrix I'm at my apex
Literally and figuratively my mind is like an annex niggas
I'm so ahead of you not defined by red or blue
I'm defined by what's in my mind, head and vocal tubes
You hear the horn and strings this Capricorn's King
Capping at your vehicle so I'm capping at your darn screen
Crown is tilted town is gifted my pounds will leave you twisted
Weed smoke plus my music a hallucinogen experiment
You should experience it neither one is expensive shit
I don't need to explan this shit just get it through your brain and shit

[Hook]
