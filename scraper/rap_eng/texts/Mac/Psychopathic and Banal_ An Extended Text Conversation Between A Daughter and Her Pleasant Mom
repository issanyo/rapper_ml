This is an experiment in annotation and a work in progress (much more dialogue is forthcoming). The following conversation is a raw and unabridged text conversation, between an real-life psychopath and her daughter (see the description for context). Although much is without context and, consequently, abstract, I believe an considerable amount can be gained from an examination of the deep and present rhetorical patterns.

In the end, my hope is that this might become both an educational source for some and a source of comfort for others.

'Sic' will apply to the entire transcript.

[Psycho C]
If you want me to waste $350.00 seeing dr G tomorrow am, plus buy your drugs I must have proof that Davis has his own drugs .
Do not slam doors and scream about C trying to get you both our of that bedroom and knocking on doors for jobs. Davis needs
to pay to see a dr and get his Own drugs unless his parents will buy drugs and FedEx it to Davis .

[Psycho C]
Mac please move your car and obamacare just sent you an email I need that info to finish your application for Heathcare

12/6/13, 7:52 PM

[Mac]
I don't deserve this help

12/19/13, 4:21 PM

[Mac]
Hi mom, how are you doing?

12/20/13, 1 :30 PM

[Mac]
Did she leave yet?

[Psycho C]
No leaving at 3:30

[Mac]
Ugh
She's a judgemental person who does not care about me OR D


[Psycho C]
She sees the world more like dad does

[Mac]
It was hard enough having to sit at the table with her and eat her food when she acts like she was never so unforgivably intrusive and
rude. I can't even look at her anymore. I was hoping I wouldn't have to see her again.
She is not an "aunt" or family as far as I am concerned
I just want to go in the kitchen, are you sitting out there for two more full hours?

[Psycho C]
Aunt P. Will be here until 3:30 today and sleep here tonight then she is going back to ricks .
The Torah and the bible address the importance of forgiving people and accepting them for all of who they are. Seeing the good in
people when we feel judged by them is difficult and important to learn to do. Not many of our relatives are alive and it would be sad to
cut aunt p off .
Something I try to remember when I have been hurt by someone is: I ask myself was their intent driven by caring about us? If so, I
work on forgiving and accepting them with their frailties and mistakes .
It's sometimes relatively easy to forgive a person who has hurt you and often very difficult to forgive a person when I struggle to let go
of my anger toward them and/ or what they did to hurt me.
Each of us has the choice daily and moment to moment to create stress and bad feelings to others or to create peace, acceptance
and a good feeling to others . Your choice. Aunt p is in her. SO's and this is last time she will drive here from Tennessee • You may
want to remember the many good times you have had with aunt paddy and forgive her.
A hug an a kind word can be healing for both of you. Your choice.
Please remember what you have done just in the past few months that was hurtful to me and dad and we always will forgive you . It's
healthier for all of us to truly forgive and embrace one another ....
Ok I'll stop my little sermon. Oxox I love you Mac forever and always!
* Let those who make no mistakes hurdle the first stone •

[Psycho C]
I wanted to say goodbye and give u a hug at about. 3:30 but you turned down the sound and did not respond so I respected your
privacy.
We will be home about 8:30ish. Aunt P will sleep over tonight and leave tomorrow for Roger's .

[Mac]
I hate you
Your sermon?
You are probably the dumbest person I know
And I can't wait to never see you again or ugly patty and Jeff
You just pick and choose things from the bible you're the fucking devil
You never say anything that is not in your favor but to help others, it 's always about you
Enjoy spending money to · ht
You make me so sick
You don't •1ove1 me
And you are probably the worst forgiving person because you pretend to forgive yet you bring up past events that were resolved over and over end over again throughout years and year
You make it so blatantly obvious that you don't care
You are the worst person I know and I really can't stand to even be around you and your Lying rotting self
Those cards on the table are so lame, people don't keep cards that are impersonal like that it's fucked up that you decided it's better
to not have D's art on the cards
It's impersonal
As usual
I don't know how you can be so out of it
You never once asked about doing the workbook
In the two days
You only care about saying things and not actually what you mean

12/21/13, 1:42 PM

[Mac]
When is patty leaving
I don't want to see her and I'm starving
D told me how terrible patty was to her last time
I can't stand her.
I'm going to be leaving today soon anyways but I'm really very hungry
Why do you always type a text and then delete it? Do you just not know what you think or feel
Ugh

[Psycho C]
She isn't leaving for 1-2 more hours. She isn't coming back this time. Dads cousin Joe SP***ONE was here with his two girls and
they wanted to see you. I'll let you know when they will return incase you'd like to visit with them.
Dad bought a beautiful tree at WF and as soon as he comes back from the office he is going to bring it into the house. Do you and
Davis want to help with the tree ?

[Mac]
I'm levent
You again only want to use us
No thanks
We are leaving
I just went to get lasagna from the kitchen is there no one around? I don't fucking hear through the door
