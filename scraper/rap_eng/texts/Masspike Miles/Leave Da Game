(Chorus x2)
Every time I wanna leave, I just can't go away
These streets keep callin' my name
Every time I wanna leave, I just can't go away
I can't never leave da game

No matter how many time I go to jail
I can't never leave da game
No many how many times I fuck up
I can't never leave da game

[Verse 1]
Grow up poor, poorer than most
No papa to show me the Ropes
So my animal instinct on me go for the dough
A young nigga started packing toast for the loaf
Rob another and another and a sister and a brother
Even robbed a nigga that I thought was undercover for a whole block of butter
Cracka's knockinon my mamma dope, before my mamma woke
Watch the dreamin' on me beain' on a higher road
It was downhill from now
It was downtown Jails and cold courtroom air
Every year I say I'm fin to change
But every year still the same, ice cold, water still feel my vein
I can't leave the game, born in it, sworn in it, swerving ina foreign in it

[Chorus]
No matter how many niggas doubt me
I can't leave the game
No matter who many cops get pull on my wrist
I can't leave the game
Never leave the game

[Verse 2]
Pay for my broken home, broken alone
Made the best outta what I had
Gun, glove and mask
So deep in the game, I couldn't leave if I try
Even if I quit, keep scream in quad
The shit is all I know, this all I ever knew
Started from the bottom then I rose to level two
Cars got fancy, bitches did too
Ain't got lover nigga, wishin' that was you
But they don't know the struggle, triple triose and the pain
They don't see the trouble, just the flose and the fame
They don't see them niggas pointing fingers for the blame
The bodies, the shotties, the blood, the stains
I can't leave the game, I'm born in it, sworn in it
Swervin' in a foreignin it

[Chorus]
No matter how many time I go to jail
I can't never leave da game
No many how many times I fuck up
I can't never leave da game

[Verse 3]
Money in the power, keep on callin' me
Plus the pussy and the powder make it hard to sleep
Cali flowers on my chest make it hard to breath
And all let's get by and make it hard to leave
I live for the stage, the mics and the lights
I'm so tired of cuffs and gettin' read my rights
Signed my first solo deal on the run, my advance
We spend on the loyal, bail on the gun
Never givin' the chance, always over look
Never givin' the glance so I took it like a crook, like I should
Like I 'pose to, now I had it hard sandk when I flow to
I can't leave the game
I was born in it, sworn in it

Every time I wanna leave, I just can't go away
These streets keep callin' my name
Every time I wanna leave, I just can't go away
I can't never leave da game

No matter how many time I go to jail
I can't never leave da game
No many how many times I fuck up
I can't never leave da game
