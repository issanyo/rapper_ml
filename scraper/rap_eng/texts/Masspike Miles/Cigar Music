[Intro: Rick Ross]
Uh, uh
I'm so compassionate with my compositions
Check it

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Fascinated with foreign felines since I was knee high
This cigar got me buzzin' like a beehive
Fuck my old chick I'm ridin' with my new thing
In her blue jeans, panties like shoestrings
Most wanted, I'm Bin Laden on a beat nigga
Rubber band jeans saggin' on my feet nigga
100 grand for the wagon and her feet nigga
Black flaggin' just braggin' I'm a street nigga
On the grind little rappers wanna eat with us
Tryin to shine like Birdman man teeth glitters
VMA find time just to creep with her
So coincidental walkin' down the street with her
My loose cheese scooped up the Gucci
In 2 weeks I flew thru the boutiques
She get her time limit when I let her go and shop
Cruisin' in the car clip the cuban at the top
Niggas know that my techs explode
Down to go toe to toe before Tecmo Bowl
Biggest boss in the game, chatter I never mind that
Cause if it mattered C-Murder would go diamond
I reflect as I'm ridin' in a Rolls Royce
Get respect because I give these hoes no choice

[Hook: Masspike Miles]
Because I-I-I-I-I
Because I do it
So if you never seen a boss nigga
Then look at me
Because I do it
And they never seen a boss nigga
But now they see
Because I do it
And I do it
I-I-I-I-I
And I do it
Yeah so now you see what it means
To be a boss cause I do it

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm the down-south Nas
Click so firm
Ridin' with a fox as the cigar burn
Niggas sell weed, niggas sell coke
If I was sellin' dope baby I'd be sellin' both
But I'm sellin' records everythin' I touch gold
Better yet check the record 3 million sold
2 hand guns on the riders for the show
On the road to the riches when I'm ridin' on vogues
I elaborate on things I only been bout
Besides, we decides who's the in crowd
If its Ne-Yo and niggas who speakin' Creole
What I got the prove we just keep movin' kilos
See the Audemar its call it Terminator
The exact watch only Arnold wore in Terminator
I let her ride me like a elevator
Clip another cuban as I wait to celebrate her

[Hook: Masspike Miles]
Because I-I-I-I-I
Because I do it
So if you never seen a boss nigga
Then look at me
Because I do it
And they never seen a boss nigga
But now they see
Because I do it
And I do it
I-I-I-I-I
And I do it
Yeah so now you see what it means
To be a boss cause I do it

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Fascinated with foreign felines, that's my design
As I recline cut em like key lime
We both came now its right back to the tea time
I won't insult her being vulgar with no cheap wine
She told me that her other man man broke
Walkin' on the clouds of my second hand smoke
I touched her with the seconds hand stroke
Got her mind racin' quicker than a Lambo
2 seater it couldn't fit Toccara
But I promise baby ill be back tomorrow
In a big Beamer bumpin' Bob Marley
Listen closely and hit a woman softly

[Hook: Masspike Miles]
Because I-I-I-I-I
Because I do it
So if you never seen a boss nigga
Then look at me
Because I do it
And they never seen a boss nigga
But now they see
Because I do it
And I do it
I-I-I-I-I
And I do it
Yeah so now you see what it means
To be a boss cause I do it
