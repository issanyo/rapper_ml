Now she dealing with a boss
Rocks in the ear
So much work in the crib
You can smell it from over here
The odour strong
And the lord you know I'm wrong
But convertable phantoms
Just got yo boy all in the zone
Got my face in the sky
Embracing to die
Hooked on that cash
Still chasing the high
Oatmill, timberlands I'm heavy on the pedal
Swurving in the ghetto gotta be on schdual
In The Streets yeah they know me as Mass Pike Miles
Sometime niggas want *****?
I'm addicted to the hustle, addicted to the game
The street life nigga I'm loving it
I get I I I get it and my beef in the hood
Yo yo he get it
I took nothin and turned it into something
Off baking bread in the oven
I'm all about dough, I'm all about a dollar
If it don't make money and it don't make sense
And if we can get it together just holla
Dougghhh, I'm all about a dollar (I'm all about a dollar)
If it don't make money and it don't make sense
And if we can get it together just holla
See I got long dough
Longer then a nose on a eagal
Enough to keep the heat off me from 5-0
I distribute from the east and the westcoast
Listen to yo boy, I'm like Nino
Got em serving out the carter from the third floor
Plus you need I.d to pass the front door
This big bussiness best believe I'm in this
Waste deep yeahhhhh
I'm all about dough, I'm all about a dollar
If it don't make money and it don't make sense
And if we can get it together just holla
Dougghhh, I'm all about a dollar (I'm all about a dollar)
If it don't make money and it don't make sense
And if we can get it together just holla
I know my name is buzzing in the street
Got alota haters and enemies
Plus the feds are trying to infistrate me
But I'm starter then them smarter then them
Yo man we in it this deep
I ride for you my nigga and you ride for me
And my brothers keeper
YES I am
We stil counting last nights rounds
In the jag burning grass waltsing mass pike miles
I'm thinking trya banks I'm talking lora london
YAYO or London stay smoking somthin
Maybacks float (float)
Slanging that dope (dope)
Whoes cars clothes
All I know
On the run with a bad bitch
Staying number one
Getting ones ****? rich
I'm all about dough, I'm all about a dollar
If it don't make money and it don't make sense
And if we can get it together just holla
Dougghhh, I'm all about a dollar (I'm all about a dollar)
If it don't make money and it don't make sense
And if we can get it together just holla
