[Hook: Gunplay and Masspike Miles]
Got my hate up with my weight, 'cause niggas gon' test ya
And these bitches only with you for the fame
I'm just tryna to live ten toes on the grit
But I became a house hold name (Now I'm a house hold name)
Wanna be a rapper but they just won’t let it happen
Nigga tryna trade the cage for the stage
They paid on our demises try to stop us rising
But in the process we became a house hold name
(Now I'm a house hold name)

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Tell me why you niggas want to see me broke and dead
Don't wanna see me eating, wanna see me choke instead
And that’s why my chopper be my only co-conspirator
Cocaine, coke, and Smirnoff this ain't no Smoke and Mirrors
Drunk on the road to riches in the V I'm veering off
Sleeping on the steering wheel ended up back in Miramar
I'm looking for my gift already cursed with all this curses
And with these verses I surf the Earth's surface

[Hook: Gunplay and Masspike Miles]
Got my hate up with my weight, 'cause niggas gon' test ya
And these bitches only with you for the fame
I'm just tryna to live ten toes on the grit
But I became a house hold name (Now I'm a house hold name)
Wanna be a rapper but they just won’t let it happen
Nigga tryna trade the cage for the stage
They paid on our demises try to stop us rising
But in the process we became a house hold name
(Now I'm a house hold name)

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
I just wanna write rap songs, rock black stones
Watch craps roll, and stay off of tapped phones
I just want a clean bitch in a black thong
And just one slida rida I can bank on
I’m a legend living still ain't begged forgiveness
As I chug another Guinness, choppin' work up with the winners and the trap hoes
They try to end me from the start
Looking up to God, as I embark upon a higher plateau

[Hook: Gunplay and Masspike Miles]
Got my hate up with my weight, 'cause niggas gon' test ya
And these bitches only with you for the fame
I'm just tryna to live ten toes on the grit
But I became a house hold name (Now I'm a house hold name)
Wanna be a rapper but they just won’t let it happen
Nigga tryna trade the cage for the stage
They paid on our demises try to stop us rising
But in the process we became a house hold name
(Now I'm a house hold name)

[Verse 3: Masspike Miles]
They try hold me back yeah they wanna see a real nigga fall
They told me life is the price and my loved ones tears was the cause
Yeah, all my real niggas feel me
Try to judge but there's nothing that defeats me
For the love of the fame
They sacrifice for a name
'Cause that's the rule of the game

[Hook: Gunplay and Masspike Miles]
Got my hate up with my weight, 'cause niggas gon' test ya
And these bitches only with you for the fame
I'm just tryna to live ten toes on the grit
But I became a house hold name (Now I'm a house hold name)
Wanna be a rapper but they just won’t let it happen
Nigga tryna trade the cage for the stage
They paid on our demises try to stop us rising
But in the process we became a house hold name
(Now I'm a house hold name)
