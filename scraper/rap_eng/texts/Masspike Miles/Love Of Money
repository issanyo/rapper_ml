[Verse 1:]
I put my money in the freezer, I call it cold cash
My coat stash is bigger than Coca-Cola's ass
It's dimes in my pocket, dimes in my bed
Serve a quarter chicken, make sure you fed
The trap love me, cousin I rap lovely
Been killing 'em from the jump, crack bungee
I'm Chris Humphries, cheating on the baddest bitch
40 round clip, I call it the magic stick
It makes rappers disappear, whisper in yo ear
Crystal clear, come here, let me kiss yo tears
Put the lotion in the basket bitch before you catch it
Tie you to a mattress, turn it into yo casket
I get respect on the same blocks who hustle on
So is it's all I'm The West, fuck yo mom!
Fore the came up we, I keep the cutties calm
These serial killers will eat you for your lucky charm

[Hook:]
This one for the dollar, gotta get it
That's all that I do
Can never be scared cause we with it
Gotta do what I do yea
It's all for the love of money
Cash, clothes, the cars and the honeys
Yea money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round ah yea

[Verse 2:]
I wanna make love to an angel
My pocket is handcuffed to a halo
I stand up in the ghetto, babe bro, this ain't full
Button ups and cangos, my pockets lumpy
Like I stuff potatoes under mangos
Big guns stuffed with egg rolls
Who wanna tango? This is wrong
I'm re-tweeting, why the dope problem?
So DM it baby if you got a coke problem
I gotta see er cope, got er nose diving
Without yo favorite rapper co-signing
I got a gorgeous day but you got this note that I got it all
That as soon as it got important
Like a model from a 3rd world country that I
Nutted in before she got deported
And I signed a deal for the part, no before it got recorded
This is business, for that money I blow
Leave yo aye, yo sunny side up, rude boy

[Hook:]
This one for the dollar, gotta get it
That's all that I do
Can never be scared cause we with it
Gotta do what I do yea
It's all for the love of money
Cash, clothes, the cars and the honeys
Yea money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round ah yea

[Verse 3:]
Listen, we tryna make digits, gotta get me a few bucks
You tryna play with it, that gets you a few buck buck
Sun is dead a real, we move weight
Homie you on a treadmill tryna remove weight
Lots of haters, they are mad
They pissed off cause cash I pilot like the operator aircraft
Cocked and spray up their ass
I hit you with the impact of a truck
But I will not inflate a airbag
Gotta get this cheddar for...
My first and second born
If this epilogue never score big I ain't never raw but I swear
If ain't got some chips
Cock the 5th, turn yo Range to a pasta dish nigga
Gotta watch the million frames, they go over a million frames
Long as you can game ends
But see when no money remains then they'll be gone
Put that in the cane end
Money to the eyes wide, like they on a kingpin, excuse me

[Hook:]
This one for the dollar, gotta get it
That's all that I do
Can never be scared cause we with it
Gotta do what I do yea
It's all for the love of money
Cash, clothes, the cars and the honeys
Yea money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round ah yea
