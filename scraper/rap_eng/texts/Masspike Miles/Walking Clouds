[Intro: Fred The Godson]
MassPike Miles
Gordo!
Frederico baby
When I'm on these joints call me Freddy Pendergrass
Let's do it

[Hook: Masspike Miles]
I gotta know you, darling
So come and tell me, tell me what's your name
Girl, it's something in the atmosphere that truly changed me
Once you came my way
I call you my longtime lover
Hear me, my longtime lover
Somewhere on a cloud
Our hearts beating loud
Let me write to my love again

[Verse 1: Fred The Godson]
Frederico, I'm at your service
I've never seen used before, refurbished
Mama, you look nervous, take a deep breath
Last of a dying no lying it's only me left
Forget your ex, he's not needed
He's drinking in Arizona, we can fly to Phoenix
Fred is the man, you know how I live
Just gas em' a little, call it the hybrid
Let's ride with no windows, drop top feel, feel the wind blow
She you know I'm part of the block, TBM though
See her father's a cop, Laura Winslow
My aura will always win though
Shorty thick as hell but her waist thin though
So call your friends, we can be friends
We can do this every weekend

[Hook: Masspike Miles]
I gotta know you, darling
So come and tell me, tell me what's your name
Girl, it's something in the atmosphere that truly changed me
Once you came my way
I call you my longtime lover
Hear me, my longtime lover
Somewhere on a cloud
Our hearts beating loud
Let me write to my love again

[Verse 2: Fred The Godson]
She never took a whiff of this cologne
Could tell by my wrist I got money I could loan
Gotta tell her fast they don't want her with me
Before they mess up my speech I tell her swiftly
400 on a bucket, this is your destiny, don't leave until you're lucky
Cough it, I will, let's discuss it, I feel
Like them other dudes made you disgusted, but still
They ain't Waterbed Fred
And all them birds just here for the bread
Don't be scared, I only fear the feds
If they hate, let them hate, all that nonsense dead
So where we going for dinner?
You girls like mess with Gordo he a winner
So call your friends and we can be friends
We can do this every weekend

[Hook: Masspike Miles]
I gotta know you, darling
So come and tell me, tell me what's your name
Girl, it's something in the atmosphere that truly changed me
Once you came my way
I call you my longtime lover
Hear me, my longtime lover
Somewhere on a cloud
Our hearts beating loud
Let me write to my love again
