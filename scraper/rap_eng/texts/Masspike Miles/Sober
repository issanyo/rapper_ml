"Sober"
(Verse 1)

You never want me when I'm sober
You crossed me out and say it's over
You really treat me like a playground
Push me away like I'm a stroller
You sip a little and get feisty
You startin to act like you my wifey
You only like me from the waste down
Girl that's the reason you invite me


(Hook)

I can't think when I'm sober
With out you right here
I get weak to my knees
I need you intravenously

I can't believe that it's over
Without you right here
I feel sweats in my sleep
Come and rehabilitate me

(Verse 2)

When we link up
That's when it goes down
Girl you better slow down
You keep on telling me You love me
That ain't the road you wanna go down
If want me you better show me
Show me better than what you told me
Girl back it up
Don't be frontin
I see that thang when you walkin
Come here baby let me control it
Yeah Yeah


(Hook)

I can't think when I'm sober
With out you right here
I get weak to my knees
I need you intravenously

I can't believe that it's over
Without you right here
I feel sweats in my sleep
Come and rehabilitate me
