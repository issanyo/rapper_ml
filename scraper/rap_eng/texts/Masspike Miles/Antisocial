(Hook)
Antisocial x2
(Let it burn)
I'm just trying to be me x2
Every I go
They want me to put on a show
I'm just going to be me x2
Antisocial

[Verse 1: Black Frost]
Walls closing in on me I feel trapped
Claustrophobic's on hyperventilating on the track, yeah
I'm a loner, some call me a hermit
Cause you get no access into my life without a permit
I ain't got no twin, I was born solo
But the world keep trying to knock me out like Manny did Toto
I don't smile in my photos 'cause I ain't phony
And I ain't got shit to clown about
Nah, I don't play that homie
I keep the 9 milly on me though I never have to use it
Though I'm affiliated with gangsters cause I'm abusive
Stay to myself cause I'm an introvert
But I probably need to quit holding shit in
Cause I feel like I'm about to burst
Maybe I'm cursed, a hollow body wandering
And my soul's already buried in the dirt
At least she set a woman's worth
While I'm still trying to figure out my price as I am rebirth
And I...

(Hook)
Guess that's why I'm (Antisocial)
I ain't got no (Where to turn)
Everywhere you (Go they judge you)
Guess I got to (Let it burn)
I'm just trying to be me x2
Every I go
They want me to put on a show
I'm just going to be me x2
Antisocial

(Verse 2: Masspike Miles)
Everywhere I go they hate
Trying to make it to the top
But they just want to get in my way
That's why I get my space
I heard that they was talking
But won't say it to my face
'Cause they don't want no problems
No, I kick that problem solver
Yeah, I feel them niggas watching me
(Trying to catch me slipping)
And bitches keep on stalking me, yeah
Well, let me breathe
That's I've been so low, lust more for promo
??? runs through my vocals
They call me anti-anti
Anti-snitches, anti-agents, anti-haters
And I, lean in a cup with my hoodie on, posted up, eyes open
Over in the studio getting blown to the realest shit I ever wrote
And, you know

(Hook)
Guess that's why I'm (Antisocial)
(Miles: Ohhh, nooo)
I ain't got no (Where to turn)
(Miles: I ain't got nowhere to turn, yeah, no)
Everywhere you (Go they judge you)
Guess I got to (Let it burn)
I'm just trying to be me x2
(Miles: When you see me in the streets fuck nigga don't speak)
Every I go
(Miles: ??? cause the shit's weak, cause I'm anti)
They want me to put on a show
I'm just going to be me x2
Antisocial
[Miles: I'm just gonna be me, I feel them niggas watching me
(I'm anti)]
