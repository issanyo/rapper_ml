S. O. S
I know you want me
I know you’re feeling, girl
Sitting in the back of the club all by yourself
Thinking you’re all alone but girl I’m here
(Don’t worry baby, I’m right here)
Oh, get a lil bit closer to me
????
Tonight’s the night your problems disappear
Girl, you need a little trickin’ …
Yeah, so come get some
(Don’t worry baby, let’s go)
Chorus
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have it strong
Sky is the limit and you know you can do what you want
I really feel ya vibe
Look into my eyes
You got me hypnotized
I really really want your body
I really really need your body
I really really want your body
I really really need your body
I really feel ya vibe
Look into my eyes
You got me hypnotized
I can look in your eyes
??? the days that you cry
You needed your heart stayin’ clean
I promise that I can fix it, oh
I can feel it in it baby, know the way your mother make you feel
Take a minute, soak it in girl, ‘coz this love is real
Get a lil bit closer to me
???
Tonight’s the night your problems disappear
Girl, you need a little trickin’ …
Yeah, so come get some
(Don’t worry baby, let’s go)
Chorus
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have it strong
Sky is the limit and you know you can do what you want
I really feel ya vibe
Look into my eyes
You got me hypnotized
I really really want your body
I really really need your body
