Time to switch up the tempo
You know torch man I am so out of the vibes
People come into your life for a reason
There is no lifetime so you decide how long they stay in
You think you see clear vivid essence ain’t no fake till you make it here
MG we are getting money used to wipe de 300 .. stopping night has been keep my self-esteem over ..
Hustle and muscle recipe I am tone on these streets till is me rest in peace believe half of what you see
Nothing to hear about get a job who you know is all they care about quit smoking that hurt nothing …
Relax where the weed at can’t lie still …still tryin to make the city proud momma smiling where I was not aloud
All these opportunities got me watch my crowd watch .. on these haters watching my doubt
I know what time it is see these writing on the wall ice on the floor I ain’t sleeping
Does .. I ain’t tripping because of me mother fucker that’s man I am just thinking out loud
I am just thinking out loud no matter how hard I try I just can’t shake this struggle of my life
Even though I make the sacrifice no matter how I hold it in sorry I just got to get it out
From now on I am speaking loud you can’t walk in my shoes cause you can’t pay my duce
I know you don’t understand what it is to be a man
From now on I am speaking loud you can’t walk in my shoes cause you can’t pay my duce
I know you don’t understand what it is to be a man
Reminisce for how long I play for this shit sometimes I feel like I ain’t made for this shit
Being fake the new real I pass money coming fast niggers winning by master and being kiss in the ass
Following truth I am so numb .. beneath me treat me like where I came from wow I am just thinking out loud
Hurt to my soul pain to my spine who is gonna be there and
When I need them they ask most tell me who is gonna be there
Probably not but the fake .. worth a lot .. my mother of the block not a record deal
Sell a record still work in progress for the record I know I am blessed so .. response
I stay with it I don’t play boy I get paid I am so self made boy too things .. out of fuck
Some of the badest bitches in the universe dead broke I am just thinking out loud
No money about so I got to be me my style my swag now I speak from the heart ain’t no
Ain’t no secret most of these rap niggers .. but you I am just thinking out loud
I am just thinking out loud no matter how hard I try I just can’t shake this struggle of my life
Even though I make the sacrifice no matter how I hold it in sorry I just got to get it out
From now on I am speaking loud you can’t walk in my shoes cause you can’t pay my duce
I know you don’t understand what it is to be a man
From now on I am speaking loud you can’t walk in my shoes cause you can’t pay my duce
I know you don’t understand what it is to be a man
