[Verse]
Wanna hate just cause I’m the man, call me "mister got it all"
Drop stacks on the bar just cause I can
I’ll teach you how to ball
Better do your lay ups, better get your weight up
Your swag's a made-up
Your girl should take her
You ball 'n fall, not me at all
I’m on my job, I got it all

[Hook]
I came straight up from the bottom
And now it’s my time to shine
I do this cause it’s my ambition
If I want it, then I’m gonna get mine
I came too far to turn around, oho
I came too far to give up now

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah, I got it, yeah, yeah I got it
Yeah, yeah, I got it
Cause I’m a boss
Yeah, yeah, I got it, yeah, yeah I got it
Yeah, yeah, I got it
Cause I’m a boss

[Verse]
Hold up, wait a minute, let me put my swag up in it
That boy ain’t workin', your girl stay flirtin'
And that’s for certain, I’m so deserted
Your voice's distortion, while your pockets hurting
Better do your lay ups, better get your weight up
Your swag's a made-up
Your girl should take her
You ball 'n fall, not me at all
I’m on my job, yeah I got it all (yeah)

[Hook]
I came straight up from the bottom
And now it’s my time to shine
I do this cause it’s my ambition
If I want it, then I’m gonna get mine
I came too far to turn around, oho
I came too far to give up now

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah, I got it, yeah, yeah I got it
Yeah, yeah, I got it
Cause I’m a boss
Yeah, yeah, I got it, yeah, yeah I got it
Yeah, yeah, I got it
Cause I’m a boss
