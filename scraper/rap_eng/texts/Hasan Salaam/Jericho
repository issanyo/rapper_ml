[Chorus: Hezekiah]
Fuck how you feel about me
Say what you will about me
But let’s see how you feel
When the walls come tumbling down
When the walls come tumbling down yeah
When the walls come tumbling down

[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]
They're saying racism in Americas over
Well tell that to the pigs when they pulling me over
No eye contact just a gun out the holster
Plantation overseers, prisons, filling their quota
They call us niggers
They call us thugs
Say we all good for nothing and we all sell drugs
They call for blood
They call in the squadron
But I am Oscar Grant I am Trayvon Martin
Jelani Manigault and Phillip Pannell
Invisible man faces at the bottom of the well
We been through hell
Still see eternal life Henrietta Lacks cells
Uncle Tom's been corrupting the biz
And that's word to the wire under Al Sharpton’s wig
Pigs still shoot us in that back tho
Regardless of the nigga tweets by Gwyneth Paltrow
How low do we go to fit in
Killing ourselves even bleaching our skin
Racism been stayed right on track
And none of it changed just because the presidents black fuck that

[Chorus: Hezekiah]
Fuck how you feel about me
Say what you will about me
But let’s see how you feel
When the walls come tumbling down
When the walls come tumbling down yeah
When the walls come tumbling down

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]

They wanna condition your brain when they get in there
To make you believe that the walls always been there
Persevering the game without getting your flesh torn
Gotta get to a square that’s not on a chess board
Invisible walls classism and privilege
That are taller than apartheid walls you live with
Governments a business clouded in smoke
And when you’re broke only real choice Pepsi and Coke
Muthafuckaz will build a wall for every reason alive
But then change the reason when they get you inside
They build a wall to try and keep terrorists out
And it becomes symbolic of what terrorism’s about
Build a great wall for barbarian neighbors
And it’s trampled by tourists a thousand years later
Now they built a wall to keep immigrants out
But wanna pick and choose the immigrants they talking about

[Bridge: Immortal Technique]
Jericho's Walls came tumbling downward
The hand of God turns Rock and Metal to powder
Rebellious Minds, I need you to think louder
Before they police every thought they encounter
Jericho's walls came tumbling downward
When empires fall you see who laid the groundwork
You think the Spark of Revolution's an outburst
I guess before Jericho we come to your house first

[Chorus: Hezekiah]
Fuck how you feel about me
Say what you will about me
But let’s see how you feel
When the walls come tumbling down
When the walls come tumbling down yeah
When the walls come tumbling down
