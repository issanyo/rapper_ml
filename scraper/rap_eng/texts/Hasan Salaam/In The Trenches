[Hook: Immortal Technique]

We in the trenches, on the offensive
Runnin' through machine gun fire and barbed wire fences
Muthafuckas say that violence is senseless
But so is getting slaughtered when you caught up defenceless
We in the trenches, on the offensive
Runnin' through machine gun fire and barbed wire fences, (Rebel Armz!)
Like the Viet Cong back with a vengeance
Your life is worthless but war is expensive

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]

I'm like the spirit of the slave trade, follow the route
Why the fuck you think them hurricanes tear through the south?
And the Mid-Atlantic, starving the frantic
Stranded, abandoned, but Iâ€™m branded the hand of God
So I stand in command of the answer for radiation driven cancer
Tuskegee and the way that they murdered the Panthers
Back-up dancers for proposition 187
But my counter-proposition is a one eighty seven
I'll put a bounty on the head of a racist reverend
And drag his body through the streets on September 11th
My presence is like a Pentagon produced earthquake
Forced abortion to control the birth-rate
Planned incarceration with test scores from the 4th grade
New world order just completed the fourth stage
But before I ever surrender to the law
I'll turn this shit into Haiti, in 1794!

[Hook X2]

[Verse 2: J Arch ]

Now, respect I demand that, do your history
Give the Indians and Africans they land back
Bustin' my ass, while the man stand back, for minumun wage
Nah, I just don't understand that
My skill level way beyond collegiate
Capsize the boat and make the passengers sea sick
Smooth with that street shit, moons(?) who's I be with
Taking back what's ours like the people of Egypt
Rebel arms representer I pledge my allegiance
No matter how I do it I break through their defense
Fuck a false pretense or sensitive ass meanings
Germany getting nice on America's current events
North Korea nukes in the morning headlines for the evenings
We all cool as fuck, but they don't want to see us breathing
By the time she on the moon (?) check to see if they receive it
Madman militant it's strategic

[Hook X2]

[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam ]

This isn't just drums and rhythm, this is guns and ammunition
When its sung, redrum for the system
Let the slugs rumpapum, get it buck when you listen
Anarchist cookbook, I got the heat in the kitchen
Act up and wind up using a tube for the pot that you piss in
Sundiata spittin, yeah I rock for tradition
I'm a man on a mission like Clarence 13
Or the great Saladin leading the Mujahideen
Make moves like Kasparov, with a sawed-off and Molotov
Flows synonymous with the kickback of a Kalashnikov
Mossberg Upanishads, punishing your promenade
Like Arch Duke Ferdinand BONG in front your entourage
Rebel Armz firing squad, lugers to bazookas
Minds balanced with the talents of Larry Davis & Lumumba
Laying grounds for the future, Cairo on the 25th
All power to the people when that 5th Column spits
