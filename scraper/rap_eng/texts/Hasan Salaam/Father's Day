[Chorus]
Life is a wheel and in this circle

[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]
When I was young with a pad and a pencil
I grew and drew you as the example of the evil that men do
Said to your only sun he wouldn’t be shit
And I’ve spent most of my life really believing that shit
Now I wonder how I could’ve been deceived that quick
Cause up until that point you ain't teach me shit
I guess you ain't consider raising up a half a nigga
Unable to relate to the world at odds with yah
Had to rip your face out a couple of family pictures
Moms doing alright you know she ain't bitter
She even told me to take the time to sit and build with yah
But it’s been a minute pops the fuck been up with yah?

[Chorus]
Life is a wheel and in this circle

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]
Like father like sun same temper and all
Similar downfalls drowned out in alcohol
Round the time I got involved with the yes yes y'all
I caught a vision and listened to the Adhans call
Of course I wanted to know what you thought of it all
But instead of healing wounds you chose to throw me salt
Which brought our interactions to immediate halt
I remember hitting heavy bags waiting to square off
Wondering the thought that brought y’all to pair off
Were you truly loves deepest believer
Or were you just passed down the lust of the master and overseer
That left you struck with a severe case of jungle fever
See the illest thing that these eyes done seen
Was the klan raping a sister in your porn magazine
That’s some impossible shit to wipe clean
Like I was just the mistake of your wildest wet dream
Seemed at some points you wasn’t willing to deal
Treated like the black sheep of your family for real
Like race wasn’t an issue until truth was revealed
And I was accused of taking shit I wouldn’t have to steal
That’s some ill shit to have on your mind at 9
Kind of hard to be color blind when I’m hated for mine
But all of that never seemed to tarnish my shine
Till shorty said she was pregnant and swore it was mine
But that marriage ended in miscarriage
More weight for the scales that tipped me to savage
Me and Moms started going at it over everything
Disrespecting her home
Me thinking I’m grown
Like why bother I could father myself on my own
It’s against the laws of nature but through time it’s shown
No matter how wise or concrete my mother was planned
No woman by herself should have to raise no man
Especially 1 driven with a heart full of hate
All the fighting used to make her say she saw you in my face
So I’m guessing its fate that brought me here to take care of yah
Life in Black & White gotta be some grey area
Your sickness impairing yah
Barely able to walk on your own and just think I used to be scared of yah
But that’s what makes all of this that much harder
Cause Allah always said honor thy Mother and Father

[Chorus]
Life is a wheel and in this circle
