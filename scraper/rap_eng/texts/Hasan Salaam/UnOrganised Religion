[Chorus]
Congregation gon' say amen
Congregation gon' say amen

Congregation can't say "awoman"
Congregation gon' say amen

Congregation gon' say amen
Congregation gon' say amen

Congregation can't say "awoman"
Congregation gon' say amen

Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but...

[Verse 1]

Said the covert Worship and pray to they false idols
From puppets in churches while floating they false titles
Mary Magdalene gospels hidden in lost bibles
Black messiah crucified in the crosses of they rifles
Leopold sold indulgences for cleansing the souls
Whitewashed in the dead sea scrolls
Conversion by the [?]
Genocide provides currency for the Vatican's gold
Popes bless slave ships and deny the holocaust
Kill a Palestinian Rabbi Toast it: Mazel Tov
Imams got suicide bombers popping off
Klan burning crosses Hail Mary tossing Molotovs
Preacher pushing lac yet the church roof ain't fixed
And there's air-conditioned tents in Mecca for the rich
Guess arms only pay-day through Sunday
Cause they easily back on they bullshit by Monday

[Chorus]

Congregation gon' say amen
Congregation gon' say amen

Congregation can't say "awoman"
Congregation gon' say amen

Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but...

[Verse 2]

They say what a Madonna and then what a whore
Try to act like they mother never been fucked before
The right to choose gets debated as law
Killing in the name of God in the unholiest wars
Damn the man who shot little Malala
Turned around and tried to justify it Allah
Women make 9% less on every dollar
And you complain that she spent with all that bullshit to swallow
Those who follow blind won't heed this verse
But it needs to be said because they deeds is cursed
Misleading the believers with greed and worse
Priests touching on the kids spread disease in Church
They preach that love when they speak to the parish
But how quick they change it up when it's same sex marriage
They preach that love when they speak to the parish
But how quick they change it up when it's same sex marriage

[Chorus]

Congregation gon' say amen
Congregation gon' say amen

Congregation can't say "awoman"
Congregation gon' say amen

Congregation gon' say amen
Congregation gon' say amen

Congregation can't say "awoman"
Congregation gon' say amen

Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but...

[Verse 3]

One side call me a terrorist the other side a heretic
Dirty Jerz devilish with fanatical rhetoric
Throw stones if you without sin
Don't forget your holy water go and dive right in
Dogmatic practise they fight us my fakers
You're saved when your savings are in collection plates
They must not really believe it
Cause they soul hell-bent on forcing others agreements
Lord Jesus, when the messiah returns
She'll be crucified all over Lord when will they learn?
It's like lambs to the slaughter
If God had a son so why deny him his daughter
So for all of you who think I'm going to hell
How many of y'all gone out to build a school and a well
See Angels ain't perfect even some of them fell
You must not be shit either, how else could you tell?

[Chorus]

Congregation gon' say amen
Congregation gon' say amen

Congregation can't say "awoman"
Congregation gon' say amen

Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but nothing can save them
Looking for the saviour but...
