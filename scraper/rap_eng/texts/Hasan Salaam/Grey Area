[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]
-My humble slice of Americana
Been cut and stepped on with sex, liquor and marijuana
Father chose bottle over the fam
Mama held it down with more jobs than you can count on your hand
Grandma would have me in church all day
But saw god for the 1st time with pops in AA
Playing games with his 1 day sober key chains
B4 he back at the bar hitting snow hard as a ski range
Finding me sane in them damn ink blotches
Got a longer wait than fans for Dre's detox is
When black lords was videoed ko's
I was naughty by nature getting O.P.P. like hey ho
1 track mind couldn't tell me nothing either
After that spike lee joint was called a product of the fever
Jungle boy always up in some trouble boy
Thieving, mischeiving and always tryna see double boy $$$

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]
It goes Hip-Hop don't stop the body rock
Dropped school and kicked out my Mama spot
Got bills streets was hot up in the melting pot
So my sex pistol pop popped the money shot
Ain't Never been a follower
(I'm a) Philanthropist, philosopher
Poet and pornographer
Feds wanna bust me
Pigs wanna cuff me
Mullahs wanna shush me like Salman Rushdie
Snakes gone discuss me
Their ways disgust me
But truth is none of them could fuck with me trust me
I made it this far despite all of the odds
If you can’t believe in yourself how you believe in a god
I'm a man on a mission
All fact no fiction
True to myself and all of my contradictions
Read the encryption where the moral to the story is
Life’s only black and white when developing the negatives...
