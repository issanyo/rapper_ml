[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]

Every saint gotta past every sinner got a story
No honor for the judge middle finger to the jury
Been through more than 40 days and nights here in purgatory
Got me calling for the lord but walking with my weapon on me
I don’t fit in categories and boxes
To raw to be pop to ratchet to be conscious
Truth hurts and fact is I’m brutally honest
If it ain’t about the dollars got no time for the non-cents
Just let the good times roll/ keep that bah ditty bah bullshit on hold
Here’s a little story that must be told
We want change but prefer it in the type that folds so…
Good golly Miss Molly
Seem like everybody dropping dead in the party
All I needs my spliff and my 5th of Bacardi
If I could dodge cops fuck I care about paparazzi
Got me

[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

I’d rather you hate me for who I am than love me for who I ain’t
And I’ve been up in too much sin to claim to be no saint
Hate Me or Love Me
Only God Judge Me
Hate Me or Love Me
Only God Judge Me

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]

All the shit you talk about me I’m that plus more
#1 reason I don’t give 2 fucks for
Snake saboteurs, agent provocateurs
If I was you I’d hate too I do so much more
Banked this album off adult entertainment
American gigolo the flows are X-rated
Feel some type of way?
Got something to spill?
Fuck it I ain’t see your name on not none of my bills
Everybody say they love you when you just a nobody
But soon as you blow up you part of illuminati
Married to the game all my fam threw rice
But now the honeymoon’s over so its breakup fights
The rap biz twisted and beyond run through
Fucked over to the point no more holes to screw
So much fake love no one knows what to do
Glad I stayed in porn at least you know who’s fucking who

[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

I’d rather you hate me for who I am than love me for who I ain’t
And I’ve been up in too much sin to claim to be no saint
Hate Me or Love Me
Only God Judge Me
Hate Me or Love Me
Only God Judge Me

[Bridge: Hasan Salaam]

Mic check 2, 2, 1, 2
Just cut the check let me do what I do
Mic check 2, 2, 1, 2
Just cut the check let me do what I do


[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Everything in this world is not what it seems
Half Black half White but all that matters is GREEN
Can’t stay clean out here in dirty Jerz and I been getting it in since the bees and the birds
Swerve
I’m right back at it
On the road to the riches I just dip thru traffic
Allergic to being broke downright asthmatic
But money cure anything you could go ask Magic
Enough is never enough
Life’s a bitch but trust I ain’t breaking it up
Our make-up sex keep us both laced up
Figure I could get some sleep once my wallet wake up
I rather you hate me for who I am than love me for who I ain’t
And I’ve been up in too much sin to claim to be no saint
