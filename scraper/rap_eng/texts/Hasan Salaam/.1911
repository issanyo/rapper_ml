[Refrain x2]
It goes 1 for the trouble 2 for the time/
3 for the hustle and 4 for the grind/
You know the struggle I go-go for mine/
I’m oh so inclined the G-O-Divine

[Verse 1]
I Rock & Roll for the Soul of my Ancestors
And built my dynasty without the Masonic hand gestures
Yeah, this is church right here
Young Black don’t give a fuck Amerikkka’s nightmare
Next level I’m a rebel with a cause
And you can say two words without no homo or a pause
Heard your bars and I’m somewhat appalled
So clapping at you got something to do with no applause
Memorize this slogan:
Whores, jaws and laws was made to be broken
Honestly what the fuck are y'all smoking?
Hip-Hop must be dead with the shit that y'all promoting
V-Nasty saying nigga ain’t the first for a rapper
But it’s ill how ignorance make her think that she Blacker
Coming out like race don’t matter
But it's White Girl Mob like the Ku Klux chapter
Bitch, I ain’t drinking the Kool Aid
Whoever cosign her’s just a new age slave
Looking in the mirror like look what the coon made
Give a fuck about you or your YouTube plays
I’m a lover not a fighter, but if you want me to kill ya
Shit, I could fulfill your
Wish than dance on your grave like Thriller
So pick one finger the middle or the trigger

[Hook]
I’m much more than married to the weapon I carry
Born to be like soul mates
Brought together by fortune or fate
And ain't no way that you could make us separate
It goes praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Praise the Lord, praise The Lord

[Verse 2]
My albums are more Autobiography of Malcolm
AK by the window sill
Rock for the memory of young Emmett Till
Riding shotgun with a shotty like the name Bobby Seale
Fuck a record deal or how executives feel
This last supper getcha meal, Revelation 7th seal
Put work in the field like David Walker's Appeal
So the track hit you like Brandy was whipping wheels of steel
That’s a cheap shot, I guess
But the game's gone soft, I am the least not impressed
Leeches in the game trying to feast on the flesh
Tough talk, but you run to police under stress
Ain’t no swine for mine, ya dig
My style Halal, never fuck with the pigs
It is what it is, get in the way of my plans
We toss em off stage like one of Akon's fans
Damn
