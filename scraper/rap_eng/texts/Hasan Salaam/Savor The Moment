[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]

Tailor cut suit matching tie and a button down
Pocket square, yeah I don’t fuck around
No baller just tipping them scales
My vines my wears walking on air
Yeah… It’s just what you thought I usually sport them for weddings & court
Dirty Jerz got caught in New York but public defender said I can get off
Ballin on a budget/ Got a case to beat so you know in my mind I’m like fuck it
Give a damn what the judge think
I’m next to the lawyer like my doo-doo don’t stink
Stressed to the brink
So when them charges get dropped just pass my drink
They’re spending money to see me on Rikers
But beating the system for freedom- Priceless

[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeah hands in the air
Savor the moment we keeping em there
Shout out to Jerz and everywhere
No matter where at yo the party right cheah
Family, My Flow, Faith or My Doe
Freedom, My People, 5th Column, You Know

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]

Collard greens and black eyed peas
Fried chicken, Baked mac n cheese
Hash browns, corn fritters and grits
Gonna need another stomach to finish all this
Fresh to death I must confess
Everybody dressed in their Sunday best
Blessed to have all this family around
Grandma looking royal in her church lady crown
Sounds of laughter, half-drunk pastor
The itis gone come right after
Easter brunch at Aunt Lottie’s, Aunt Rainy and Aunt Jo right beside me
They could tell just from lookin’ it, who’s responsible for cookin’ it and who put they foot in it
So for those gone I dedicate verse
Call it soul food cause this here’s church


[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeah hands in the air
Savor the moment we keeping em there
Shout out to Jerz and everywhere
No matter where at yo the party right cheah
Family, My Flow, Faith or My Doe
Freedom, My People, 5th Column, You Know

[Verse 3: Drue Davis]

In the blink of an eye
Time will pass you by
Tho there’s pain and strife
Count the blessings here in your life
Find your worth in your time while you’re here on this Earth
Before there stolen
Gotta savor the moments
