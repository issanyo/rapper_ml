[Verse 1]
I'm trying to shake of the blues
So I keep rolling them dice like c'mon yo I need new shoes
No handouts im out here paying my dues
You know the rules show n prove or you fixing to lose
Don't get it confused
Cause im out here grinding round the time you hitting your alarm on snooze
The proofs in the pudding and with all the work I put in
I'll be damned if I let somebody tell me I couldn't
But now everybody want something like I'm in a place
To put you on cause you added me as friends on myspace
I'm a keep it real sun I don't got a deal
Fuck you want me to do help you be unsigned to
Nah dude I gotta 1st take care a me and mines
Realize it goes much deeper than just beats and rhymes
Each lines designed as a stop look and listen sign
Free the mind and at the same time keep the music live…

[Hook]
The worlds just a stage everybody is on
You can only get played by the game so long
Its 15 minutes
Give yah 15 minutes
After 15 minutes you're gone…

[Verse 2]
Nowadays everybody wanna debate who's the greatest
Biasedly basing they statements on the rich and the famous
Dick riders name drop the same people and places
Claiming a 1st name basis with Diddy and Clive Davis
Labels want a Elvis situation reinstated
So they can re-write our history and tell us they made it
Them Hip-Hop police and federal agents
Keep staking out the shows and making bullshit cases
The DJ's don't really give a fuck what you saying
Long as the payola paying then somebody'll play it
Same 3 songs rotating on rap radio stations
Like fuck if its creative as long as the beat is banging
Kids no longer separate life from entertainment
And with all the gangsta shit no one explains an affidavit
Your ghostwriters ain't coming out to your arraignment
Emulating your favorite rappers a painstaking engagement
Backstabbers backstage with smiling faces
Put on Oscar worthy attempts full of obvious hatred
The games gone global and the stakes are elevated
But this started in the park making hits in the basement
Don't forget it…

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I stepped up in this game ditty bopping
Who rock and get it popping like grand wizard needle dropping
Not into share cropping for some cracker picking cotton
I just keep it Hip to the Hid Op and don't stop it
But now everybody telling me 30's the new 20
And eventually im a blow up like it was meant to be
Shit I don't got no time to wait on fate
My old Earth been sick and the bills are late
So when that mystical, magical, majestical day happen
I'll be dragging them haters from the back of the bandwagon
Half of um won't understand the jewels that I gave um
Other half still pronouncing my name Haysen Salem
So lets get better acquainted as I deliver the proof
Raw emotion every time that I steps in a booth
So just I case I wasn't properly introduced
Mom dukes call me Sanni you could call me the truth……
