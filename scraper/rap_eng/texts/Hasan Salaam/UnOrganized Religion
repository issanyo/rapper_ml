Looking for a savior but nothing can save ‘em

[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]

They covet, worship and pray to their false idols
From pulpits in churches while flaunting their false titles
Mary Magdalene gospel hidden in lost bibles
Black messiahs crucified in the cross-hairs of their rifles
Leopold sold indulgences for cleansing of souls
White washed in the Dead Sea scrolls
Conversions by the sword forced into the fold
Genocide provide currency for Vatican’s gold
Popes blessed slave ships and denied the holocaust
Kill a Palestinian Rabbi’s toast a mazel tov
Imams got suicide bombers popping off
Klan burning crosses Hail Mary tossing Molotov’s
Preacher push a Lac church roof am not fixed
And there’s air conditioned tents in Mecca for the rich
Guess alms only matter payday thru Sunday
Cause they’re easily back on that bullshit by Monday

[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Congregation gon’ say Amen
Congregation gon’ say Amen
Congregation can’t say Awoman
Congregation gon’ say Amen
Congregation gon’ say Amen
Congregation gon’ say Amen
Congregation can’t say Awoman
Congregation gon’ say Amen
Looking for a savior but nothing can save ‘em
Looking for a savior but nothing can save ‘em
Looking for a savior but nothing can save ‘em
Looking for a savior but

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]

They say men want a Madonna and men want a whore
And try to act like their Mothers never been fucked before
The right to choose gets debated as law
Yet they kill in the name of God in the unholiest wars
Damn the man that shot little Malala
Turn around went and tried to justify it to Allah
Women make 9% less on every dollar
And you’re complaining she spit with all that bullshit to swallow
Those who follow blind won't heed this verse
But it needs to be said cause their deeds is cursed
Misleading the believers with greed and worse
Priests touching on the kids spread at disease in church
They’re preaching that love when they speak to the parish
But how quick they change it up when its same sex marriage
Said they preach love when they speak to the parish
But how quick they change it up when it’s same sex marriage

[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Congregation gon’ say Amen
Congregation gon’ say Amen
Congregation can’t say Awoman
Congregation gon’ say Amen
Congregation gon’ say Amen
Congregation gon’ say Amen
Congregation can’t say Awoman
Congregation gon’ say Amen
Looking for a savior but nothing can save ‘em
Looking for a savior but nothing can save ‘em
Looking for a savior but nothing can save ‘em
Looking for a savior but

[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam]

One side call me a Terrorist
The other side a hieratic
Dirty Jerz derelict
Or fanatical rhetoric
Throw stones if you’re without sin
But don’t forget your holy water go and dive right in
Dogmatic practice say fires my fate
Cuz you're saved when your savings in collection plates
They must not really believe it
Cuz they’re so hell bent forcing others agreements
Lord Jesus
When the messiah returns
She’s crucified all over lord when will they learn
It’s like lambs to the slaughter
If God had a sun than why deny him his daughter
So for all of you talking like I'm going to hell
How many of y'all went out to build a school and a well
See angels ain’t perfect even some of them fell
Y’all must not be shit neither or how else could you tell
Well?!?

Congregation gon’ say Amen
Congregation gon’ say Amen
Congregation can’t say Awoman
Congregation gon’ say Amen
Congregation gon’ say Amen
Congregation gon’ say Amen
Congregation can’t say Awoman
Congregation gon’ say Amen
Looking for a savior but nothing can save ‘em
Looking for a savior but nothing can save ‘em
Looking for a savior but nothing can save ‘em
Looking for a savior but
