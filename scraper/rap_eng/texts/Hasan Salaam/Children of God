It begins with the big bang, first thought/
Electrical impulse the brain's first spark/
Drumming of the heart/
Nine organs correlating to the nine planets to make the best part/
Mother Earth nurtured a life from dark/
Soiled for the seed and the nine months to start/
Born into a world of corruption and wickedness/
Childhood is just something to reminisce/
Innocence get lost quick in instances/
Seems like right and wrong makes no difference/
Ignorance keep us in the wilderness/
Children of God wishing we wasn't brought into this/
Shorty lived beyond her years/
Smoked haze and drank beers like a future career/
For cheap thrills she popped E pills in her pussy/
So her lovers get high when they lick between her thighs/
No examples to go by when it comes to a father figure/
Calls for daddy when random men run up in her/
Lets 'em come up in her/
Cause she figure a child would love her better than the moms that left her/
With an aunt and four cousins then bounced the other winter/
Sugar and spice, nah ain't nothing nice/
She was born bitter/
Keeps blaming herself as the reason for her best friend's killer/
And everyday his absence makes it more realer/
Her hopes are gone, dead and buried/
Made reservations early for them dirty Jersey cemeteries/
Black Wall Street ain't standing/
So the commissary is now financial planning/
The crib is a cell with no room to stand in/
Story been the same from Watts to Camden/
No money, no jobs/
So brothers think poison will keep 'em alive/
Selling genocide day and night/
Cause even with the seed of life some still seek the pipe/
One night left alone with her anger/
She tried her own abortion in the tub with a hanger/
Same fate father upstate with a banger/
Shanked by a kid who swore he keeping it gangster/
We dying off the mentality/
Casualties constantly woven through the tapestry/
The aves becoming a shooting gallery/
Everyday collective sanity slipping gradually/
The block move more like clockwork/
Best do your dirt quick before them cops search/
Living like a slave from the cradle to the grave/
The one thought, 'I gotta get paid'/
Or is it that we living afraid?/
More comfortable in a cage than dealing with change/
No time to complain or forecast this rain/
Children of God been forged in the flame/
Survived all the hardships so we could stand before thee and hollow thy name/
Our labor pains been the same since the crescent was fertile/
Be birthed in the promise it was all full circle/
Shorty fell to her knees and pleaded with God for her fate's reversal/
Cause now it's no choice but to keep it/
Can't afford the procedure and it ain't no secret/
Has no idea what do teach it/
Cause it is after born where there's a trash to leave it/
She homeless with no one to help her/
No mangers in the hood, she gave birth in a shelter/
And as they laid her up on the stretcher/
She held the child and realized God never left her/
Yes, from all is one/
And since day one been adding on to the sum/
Three stages in life for each daughter and son/
With the power to leave their footprints across the six sextillion ton/
We all line up to triple sevens/
Either build or destroy to make this world we living in hell or heaven/
The lesson's been born and your light is the sign/
For in each one of us is the will of devine/
Just look to your light as the sign/
The Children of God offspring of devine/
