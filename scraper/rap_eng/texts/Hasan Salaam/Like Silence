[Verse 1: Kendal Good]

Maybe I’ve been around too long and seen too much
My eyes are stone and the child inside is now grown
And they say that I ain’t change/ But how can that be
Running this new race all I do is pray/ That my past don’t catch me

[Chorus: Kendal Good]

What seems like silence actually screams like a siren
And in a way I forgot why I’m here
In the darkness and quiet we still reach for the light
It ain’t far away
It ain't far away

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]

Maybe I done been here to long and seen too much
Lived through nightmares so I don’t dream too much
Seems we keep on with our eyes wide shut
In an uphill climb this world is downside up
Elders told me that I’d wind up
Dead or in jail
If I ain’t wise up before my short times up
Good intentions ain’t enough to pay the rent with
And if you look at my past than it would read that I made to many bad investments
The best lessons are learned the hard way
Spending today got me paying a price putting tomorrow’s on lay away
Hard to say what’s right cause when my backs against the wall let the chips fall where they may
In order to see the light I had to 1st go astray
But I’d never trade places
Cause me and pain know each other
Got acquainted on a 1st name basis

[Chorus: Kendal Good]

What seems like silence actually screams like a siren
And in a way I forgot why I’m here
In the darkness and quiet we still reach for the light
It ain’t far away
It ain't far away

[Bridge: Kendal Good]

If we born with that blank slate
Do the sinning truly dirty up my fate
I gotta conscience but it kick in too late
If I could turn back the hands of time…

[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam]

It was 2 months and shorty had been missing her period
So I said fuck school and started skipping 6th period
At Planned Parenthood I took the news serious
But knew that I had to stack up some chips period
Immature so I just wasn’t hearing it
Had to be a better Pops than mine was period
Job hunting but truly wasn’t able
To bring home enough doe to make a future home stable
Employers thought that they was robbing the cradle
So I started bagging ounces on Moms kitchen table
Fronted a hundred when the split was 60/40 less than half not enough to take care of a shorty
Didn’t think to tell Moms cause she had some hopes for me
You know the story she wanted some grand-children
That’s when I got the call and shorty was bawling
Said my 1st was born bloody as she sat on the toilet

[Chorus: Kendal Good]

What seems like silence actually screams like a siren
And in a way I forgot why I’m here
In the darkness and quiet we still reach for the light
It ain’t far away
It ain't far away
