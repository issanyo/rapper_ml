[Refrain: Hasan Salaam]
The power U's a scorcher once she put it on yah got you hooked on her
Allow me to warn yah she ain't no good for yah that's why they call her
Fiend for her spoil her Pay bills support her that's why they call her
Can't refuse the offer once she put it on yah got you hooked on her

[Chorus: Lord Jamar] Ashes to ashes life is just like smoking dust    x4

[Verse1: Hasan Salaam]
Desperation in a whisper from a trick to a stripper
He think he gone get her
She loosening his zipper just to get the wallet quicker
No sex in the picture
She got the game of cat and mouse down to science
Only fucks clients as long as they buying
Meets up discreet and the payments are private
Works grinding in the club to up her clientele
Well aware that sex sells and she pimping it well
Her sweet tooth extends to nose candy as well
Said she hates cocaine but… loves the smell
From blunts laced with yay
To E and special K
Angel run through the alphabet like everyday
All your fantasies a phone call away
She could be anything you want deserves awards for the role play
Queen dominatrix always been her favorite
Feels like her talents wasted on average relations
Been offered everything from a college education
To all expenses paid vacations in the Caymans
It ain't what she's chasing but what she's escaping
Might choose to give it up but what's the toll is taking

[Chorus: Lord Jamar] Ashes to ashes life is just like smoking dust    x4

[Verse2: Hasan Salaam]
Now despite what you'd expect she's not in it for the sex
Attracted to the cash only that paper make her wet
Lost love found her more concerned with a check
Total disrespect made her think it's all she could get
Cause quiet as it's kept
She's blessed with the vocals of a siren
Fallen angel wings clipped violent
The dream fell silent
The stars in her eyelids
Evaporated when her 1st forced his way inside it
Decided at an early age
That this game works both ways might as well get paid
Instead of getting fucked over for it
Might as well leave with something to show for it
Besides being broken hearted
Started off bar hopping to finance her fetish
Repeatedly playing exes living reckless
Heavy'd her soul
With her body exposed
She measured worth in dollar tips after swinging from poles
Cold shoulder
For real brothers that'll love her
But she hot to suck a dick for the rent without a rubber
Just another notch
Nameless encounter
Might forget your wife for the night but you could never forget about her… Angel

[Chorus: Lord Jamar] Ashes to ashes life is just like smoking dust    x4

[Verse3: Hasan Salaam]
Angel always planned to take it on the road to LA LA land
Find a rich man and tan on the Malibu sands
Took a chance and booked a couple locked doors in advance
Expanded past the avenue
Pussy's international
Set up a cam and a website
Red light specials just to prove that her heads right
Never saved a penny for a rainy day or valued the cost
Of possibly losing the looks or the body falling off

[Refrain: Hasan Salaam]
The power U's a scorcher once she put it on yah got you hooked on her

Fiend for her spoil her Pay bills support her that's why they call her
