[Chorus]
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I can't
Roll another one
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I can't
Smoke another one
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to  stop I can't
Light another one
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to  stop I can't
Pour another one
{Scratch}


[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]

OK… So I got a lot of problems and I usually use the bottle to try and solve um
Couple drinks away from seeing AA
And they said I’d always end up like my Pops someday
One way road to self-destruction
Puffing on something just so I could function
Bottoms up even with nothing to toast
Trying to drown all the pain till I’m comatose
Puff puff pass don’t fuck with the flow
Politicians telling you to just say no
You guilty of no stone get your stone to throw
Cuz if there’s hell below shit we all gon’ go so
Before you high & mighty’s start judging me
Pointing the finger better count the other three
You know what they say misery loves company
Look in the mirror at the actions that make you ug-ah-ly
Let see

[Chorus]
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I can't
Roll another one
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I can't
Smoke another one
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to  stop I can't
Light another one
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to  stop I can't
Pour another one
{Scratch}

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]

The hustle can’t knock it
Somebody always gonna go and sell it for a profit
Chop it up bag it hit the block and clock it
Narcs try and block it
But nobody gonna stop it
No matter what your high is
There’s always a market where demand and supply is
Keep it in the hood than they’re cool with the violence
While Rockefeller laws show a cultural bias
Less you’re Len Bias and balling for dubs
Go & OD they gonna show you no love
They’re selling bullshit about a War on Drugs
The CIA made crack that’s a War on US

[Chorus]
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I can't
Roll another one
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I can't
Smoke another one
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to  stop I can't
Light another one
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to  stop I can't
Pour another one
{Scratch}

[Bridge]
It Goes, Light something put it in the air
Pour out a little liquor for those who ain’t here
Light something put it in the air
Pour out a little liquor for those who ain’t here

[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam]

Third verse y’all last call for alcohol
Uppers, downers, amphetamines and ethanol
Rooms spinning I don’t know about the rest of y’all
Breakfast on the menu mimosa’s and Tylenol
Try em all legal drugs are the lethal ones
With all the side effects you’re better with illegal ones
From the burbs to the slums on the Ave
Homes are opium dens, crack houses and meth labs
Whether your leans codeine or a dub sack
Xanax, Ambien or hitting the junk track
Companies street game the way that they run that
No cure for your disease the monies all in the comeback

[Chorus]
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I can't
Roll another one
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I can't
Smoke another one
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to  stop I can't
Light another one
Man I smoke I drink Im supposed to  stop I can't
Pour another one
{Scratch}
