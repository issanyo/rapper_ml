The kingdom of heaven is here
We just gotta reach it
The garden stay in fruition with waters flowing beneath it
As the false idols of Babel are broken to pieces
Living prophecy take shape and a ciphers completed
The word of god was made flesh for the righteous to speak it
Not enough just to believe it
Gotta live it and teach it
Worst sin you can commit is keeping knowledge a secret
Truth is right in front our eyes most ain't looking to see it
The devil keep us deaf, dumb, and blind
Addicted to crime
Feeding us venomous swine
To poison our minds
Plague and pestilence redefine the signs of the times
For the 7th is a testament to all mankind
Both sides been aligned for the will to decide
We're on a very thin line between jinn and divine
You could feel the world spin
Here at the center of sin
Just look no further than yourself and find a heaven within...Amen

Chorus(4x)
La ilaha ilallah, ilallah
I bear witness there is none but Allah

Verse two
See there truly must be something that these atheists miss
With every breath every step the almighty exists
People bled a common thread and them wounds ain't stitched
Keep the Sabbath and a ratchet never cease and desist
Been through hell death ships brought us up the river Styx
Yet we still lift our voices to a heavenly pitch
From the pain that came down like acid rain through the mix
Fact remains that the sun of man cannot be eclipsed
10% would have you think this living god is a myth
In order to benefit from having all of us tricked
As the comatose drift through the darkest abyss
Shaytan is playing host to their ignorant bliss
Life ain't about what you got on your wrist
Your house or your whip salvation can't be bought by the rich
Every waking moment given is benevolent gift
So spend it wisely and not wasteful
The graceful are the faithful
The ungracious are the hateful
Life has proved fatal since the dawn of earth's cradle
Only you can save you
So stay true to them words you are bound
Its all ups and downs either you swim or you drown
Heavens no higher than your crown
And hell is no lower then the ground
Take a look around the hereafter is now
For fate is all based on god blessing the child
So when them lights dim in death you're born again
Allah's One and that has no beginning or end
Some could feel the world spin
Here at the center of sin
Just look no further than yourself and find a heaven within...Amen...
