[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]

I was there at the moment she died
Eyes wide open fixated on what waited on the other side
Doris Luke left at 9:45
Just the way she would’ve wanted on the wings of the sunrise
She kept her word down to the day that she passed away
Made a promise she would end a hospital stay
To watch the All Star game in a couple of days
Me and Dro wound up giving her the play by play
Allen I was her favorite
Even rocked his jersey during games and raised an arm whenever he made it
Every call by the refs was thoroughly debated
Reminiscing got me missing all the time that I wasted
I wasn’t always so patient
We argued like most family do and she knew just how to say shit
Screaming at the dealers on some government name shit
Like David don’t sell that mess in front of my pavement
Always decked out for holidays no doubt
Nuff Christmas lights to land a plane in front of her house
She defined ghetto fabulous
Planted silk flowers in the garden and grilled the best government cheese sandwiches
Shit I thought I could handle it
Sip on some yak keep a candle lit and just reach on
But now it’s just me and my Moms
And she keep wanting to speak on what ima do when she’s gone
Not a day goes by I ain't playing her songs
Year later waiting on a call all day long
1st born day without hearing her voice on the horn
Had me finally realizing my Grandmother was gone
Just go and ask anyone on Kenwood Ave
About Ms. Luke they’ll probably crack a smile and laugh
Then tell a story just like this 1
About a giant that stood around 4’11 and a half
My Grandmother

[Chorus: Maya Azucena]

That’s just how the story goes
Black Angels they come and they go
And how could I ever forget
The legacy that she left
Now she walks with the angels
My Black angel watching over me

[Verse 2: Drue Davis]

To know you is honor
To love you is a privilege the grand in grandmamma
Im’a say losing sight for you and I both an obstacle
Air through tubes couldn’t bear to see you in the hospital
Bedridden my feeling kept hidden
Resort to all this hiding while trying to keep from crying
So daily I’m denying how and what I feel inside and
You the glue to this family and be lost without your guidance
From you learned self-reliance
How to turn little into a lot and well the proof was in the pot when
Fresh from out your kitchen the scent of collards and chicken
Itching to take a peek in, but I am not want a beating
Was good and when you put your foot in bread pudding
Can surely testify am not nothing like home cooking
At home you made it, though I was frustrated now elated you ascended so
Its time I celebrated
And tell my little cousins and even unto my nieces
That you loved everybody and you're gliding round with Jesus
And know you're looking proudly, and if there’s ever doubt the
Easy breeze from my kitchen tells me that you’re all about me
So
No catching falling stars, or spiritual calling cards
Near or far, know exactly where you are
(In my heart)
Love you ma, but truth be told
An angel must spread its wings, so fly, you are not mine to hold
Mine alone

[Chorus: Maya Azucena]

That’s just how the story goes
Black Angels they come and they go
And how could I ever forget
The legacy that she left
Now she walks with the angels
My Black angel watching over me
