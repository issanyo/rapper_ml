[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]

Said you heard it all before but not like this
Bottle ready Eddie King singing nights like this
Said I sip my drink and I puff my spliff
For those dead and gone, only ones I miss
My ex fiancé can’t help but reminisce
And wish there wasn’t some of the bullshit we could fix
I was this close to settling down
But now it’s this one that one damn I get around
Through all the pain one thing that I found
Is the only time it ends is when you’re under the ground
Pound of flesh for my sins when death come and visit
‘Till then pour some liquor for G and Metaphysics
Like this

[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Said we hope for sunshine prepare for rain
Look forward to the joy but grown used to pain
Heaven fall short of what you talk out here
If hell below I'm a see y’all there
Said we hope for sunshine prepare for rain
Look forward to the joy but grown used to pain
Heaven fall short of what you talk out here
If hell below I'm a see y’all there (Cheers)

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]

Said I’ve seen better days and I’m starting to see greys
Those who love me what can I say, I push them away
Strayed off the path and ran right to the fray
Had a whole lotta dreams but life got in the way
They say the damned don’t cry
But only God knows why
Sip rye and get high to get by
Try to cleanse the sins for the sake of my Mother
But I got scars over scars and none get to recover
Roll more than credits in this life of drama
You talking ‘bout copping cars I gotta take care of my Mama
And Ima say this clear so all y’all hear
They’ll throw me in electric chairs if she shed one tear
Been looking for a reason to smile
Kinda like my brother Nelson did with the birth of his child
Been a while since I saw myself in that bright light
Too many nights starting fights wasn’t wrapped too tight
But now I’m here just trying get right
Leave the bullshit behind and I’m writing for dear life
So if you here and you done felt like I feel raise a glass to the ceiling
Let’s toast to the real
Cheers

[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Said we hope for sunshine prepare for rain
Look forward to the joy but grown used to pain
Heaven fall short of what you talk out here
If hell below I'm a see y’all there
Said we hope for sunshine prepare for rain
Look forward to the joy but grown used to pain
Heaven fall short of what you talk out here
If hell below I'm a see y’all there (Cheers)

I grew up too fast but I was having a blast
Who have known at the time that the shit don’t last
Memories are faded maybe I’m a little jaded
Just get the story from me and not the women I’ve dated
Been better been worse
No mosque no church
Just a lost soul cursed with a bottle of hurt
It is what it is no matter what life bring
The blues I sing is a beautiful thing
Despite my flaws the heart stays pure
Another day above ground can’t ask for much more
So fuck making it rain/ I'm a let it pour
40 days and nights or until my ark hits shore


[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Said we hope for sunshine prepare for rain
Look forward to the joy but grown used to pain
Heaven fall short of what you talk out here
If hell below I'm a see y’all there
Said we hope for sunshine prepare for rain
Look forward to the joy but grown used to pain
Heaven fall short of what you talk out here
If hell below I'm a see y’all there (Cheers)
