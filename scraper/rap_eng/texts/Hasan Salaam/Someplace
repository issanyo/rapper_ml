[Verse1: Hasan Salaam]
Its like coming home and finding out the locks been changed
Mailbox got new names the whole blocks rearranged
Mom and Pop spots replaced by old navy and starbucks
Fact still remains they wanna get rid of all us
From Jerz to Oaktown and back down to New Orleans
We don't own the hood we call home they strangling all us
That constitution shit it ain't never been for us
So behind closed doors you could guess what they call us
Ambitions getting clouded by the bleakest surroundings
Urban renewal only means unaffordable housing
Tenements becoming condo's worth hundreds of thousands
So single Moms with 3 mouths to feed get forced up out em
Its overcrowded at the bottom swept under the rug
Gentrification claiming more turf then Crips and the Bloods
After the flood we still waiting on something from H.U.D
But the French Quarter got Mardi Gras they partying up
What the fuck

Chorus
I'm looking for somewhere to go
Someplace that feels like home
Something I could call my own
I need some Peace of mind (mine)
I'm looking for somewhere to go
Someplace that feels like home
Something I could call my own
I need some P.E.A.C.E. of mind

[Verse2: Hasan Salaam]
My Uncle loves the devil cause he gives him nothing
He put the fear in his heart and took his knowledge from him
We keep our trigger fingers on the panic button
Self hatred got us rushing on a road straight to self-destruction
We becoming just a clone of our oppressor
Assimilate to their ways and still settle for lesser
Everyday we subject to torture beyond measure
If the tables got turned bet they'd fold under the pressure
Poverty's persistent
The ghettos afflicted
Politicians only visit for photo ops in this district
Life could end any instant
You blink and you missed it
Shit we tag our name on walls so someone knows we existed
We want some freedom but the system won't let it be
Even without a felony they push the death penalty
Genocide got us riding on the side of our enemy
There's gotta be an escape in this world of white supremacy

Chorus
I'm looking for somewhere to go
Someplace that feels like home
Something I could call my own
I need some Peace of mind (mine)
I'm looking for somewhere to go
Someplace that feels like home
Something I could call my own
I need some P.E.A.C.E. of mind

[Verse3: Hasan Salaam]
I'm trying not to let my mind erupt
Before my short time is up
I dream of heaven but I know where I'll be winding up
Recruiters in the schools quick to sign me up for lining up
On front lines of wars that ain't mine
So I can die for what?
Spill my blood over some rich mans oil
As they sit back comfortably collecting the spoils
See we're expendable as young black males
3 choices a life of servitude or you dead or in jail
We searching 4 the holy-grail as the dro is exhaled
Air is stale on the block where fresh flesh is for sale
I'll save the details for a day when justice prevails
And all the fake judges and snakes are getting stripped of their scales
Behind the veil that gets worn by this so-called democracy
Lies a country who's policy is racial inequality
So while you busy protesting occupations abroad
Might wanna fix your mess and clean your own backyard
Lordâ€¦

Chorus
I'm looking for somewhere to go
Someplace that feels like home
Something I could call my own
I need some Peace of mind (mine)
I'm looking for somewhere to go
Someplace that feels like home
Something I could call my own
I need some P.E.A.C.E. of mind
