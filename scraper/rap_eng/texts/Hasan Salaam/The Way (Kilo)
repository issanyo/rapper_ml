[Chorus: Hasan Salaam and Lano]
The Way we live is usually the way we die
Wilding, drinking, getting high
Until it’s time to say goodbye
I gotta spread my wings and fly
Lah da da da da da da
Lah Lah da da da
Lah da da da da da da
Lah da Lah da da

[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]
It goes Atlantic City nightlife
Days’ worth of highlights
Fine Philippina shorty blowing luck on my dice
Black label crushed ice
Green from the Kush pipe
Gotta love life cause you only live it once {Right?!?}
View from the 44th floor got casino lights looking much more like fallen stars
Complete with broken dreams doing doubles at the bar
And hookers on the hunt pushing up with push up bras
Like fiends on a mission
Parents gambling away their kids’ college tuition
One Mans greed is anothers ambition
So the ends multiply and dividends the division
Odds is always against yah
No matter what you bet someone’s always gone resent yah
Life’s the biggest gamble till it Russian roulette yah
Take this lesson to the grave and tell em that I sent yah…

[Chorus: Hasan Salaam and Lano]
The Way we live is usually the way we die
Wilding, drinking, getting high
Until it’s time to say goodbye
I gotta spread my wings and fly
Lah da da da da da da
Lah Lah da da da
Lah da da da da da da
Lah da Lah da da

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam and Lano]
You know what they say sex sell and crime pays
The American way makes the area grey
Lighting up haze, mics and the stage, popping Rose
Plots for the grave
Just watch what you say, cause the wrong words will end you in Guantanamo Bay
Fox News the new KKK cross my heart for the USA
For the love of money and drugs cross my heart for the USA
In GOD we trust the BANK of trust
In the Almighty DOLLAR we pray

[Chorus: Hasan Salaam and Lano]
The Way we live is usually the way we die
Wilding, drinking, getting high
Until it’s time to say goodbye
I gotta spread my wings and fly
Lah da da da da da da
Lah Lah da da da
Lah da da da da da da
Lah da Lah da da

[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam and Lano]
It goes Ho-t-t-tell, Mo-t-t-tell, Holiday Inn
G-g-getting in while the audience spend sex selling just lusting our ends
O-na-graphic, on and crackin, with my girl named Spanish Fly
B-b-better than being broke so the dopes just to cope with wherever truth lies…
Been living for today not thinking bout tomorrow
100 fast lane brown bag over the bottle
Don’t know where I’m headed but I’m going full throttle
Mile High Colorado red eyes from hydro
Cloud 9 ain’t got nothing on mine
No need to rewind it catches up in due time
I’m not giving a fuck bout how long it’s gone last
I’m just keeping up with the puff puff pass

[Chorus: Hasan Salaam and Lano]
The Way we live is usually the way we die
Wilding, drinking, getting high
Until it’s time to say goodbye
I gotta spread my wings and fly
Lah da da da da da da
Lah Lah da da da
Lah da da da da da da
Lah da Lah da da
