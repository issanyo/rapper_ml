[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]

It goes:
Unmanned drones
Attack of the clones
Bulldozing homes word to Ariel Sharon
Beyond the Green Zone… Shhhhhh it’s a secret
Only government officials and dead men keep it
Peep it
Chosen few
Army of one
Take him out of high school hand him a gun
Just do what you’re told
Salute the patrol
And exude the control
To gain an advantage
Play the game underhanded
Dead civilians we can manage
That’s collateral damage

[Chorus: Crowd]

We killing em huh huh we killing em
We Killing em huh huh we killing em (What)
We killing em huh huh we killing em
We Killing em huh huh we killing em (What)
We Killing em (What) (What) We Killing em
We Killing em (What) (What) We Killing em
We killing em huh huh we killing em
We Killing em huh huh we killing em (What)

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]

Only us-- fuck the rest of y'all
No HMO’s or PPO’s
No hospital beds for y’all
We keep it natural
GMO’s for y’all
High fructose
Glucose
High cholesterol
Food desserts    McDonalds is compost
Single cycle crops from the bowels of Monsanto’s
Chemical clouds …………..
Breathe it in
Pledge allegiance no matter what GOD you’re believing in

[Chorus: Crowd]

We killing em huh huh we killing em
We Killing em huh huh we killing em (What)
We killing em huh huh we killing em
We Killing em huh huh we killing em (What)
We Killing em (What) (What) We Killing em
We Killing em (What) (What) We Killing em
We killing em huh huh we killing em
We Killing em huh huh we killing em (What)

[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam]

Foreign policy
Enforce it violently
Make them vote at gunpoint
Fuckah THIS democracy
Hypocrisy posing for the camera
Briefcase full of foreign currency for the ambassador
See the dollar signs in genocidal ma$$acre
As long as the wars in the wars in the Middle East or Africa
Nightly news readily report our views
Skip the golden rules for the profits made from fossil fuels
Capitalize on both sides of the current
Call them all insurgents
Mass graves beneath the surface
Modern warfare
Got em all scarred
Nuclear holocaust got em in the cross-hairs cause…


[Chorus: Crowd]

We killing em huh huh we killing em
We Killing em huh huh we killing em (What)
We killing em huh huh we killing em
We Killing em huh huh we killing em (What)
We Killing em (What) (What) We Killing em
We Killing em (What) (What) We Killing em
We killing em huh huh we killing em
We Killing em huh huh we killing em (What)
