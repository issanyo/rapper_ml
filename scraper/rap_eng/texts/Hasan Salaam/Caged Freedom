[Verse 1 - Sicknature]
Freedom is an illusion, from the minute we hatch, we live in a trap
Imprisoned by interest, tax and debt extending the gap
Between the rich and the poor, while the broke are stuck with their baggage shitty
Visas get maxed out from botox and plastic titties
The value of a purchase is promptly diminished
Prices are skyrocketing while the pockets are thinning
Created incidents affect the public opinions
That count for nothing, really, we just think that someone will listen
The lower class is breaking backs, to increase the economy
Human batteries keep competing and feed the plutonomy
Debt is immense, when spending is sort of on snooze
It´s a hard knock life, while more war bucks are pursued
And more inflation is created, made for corporate reasons
This is sexomnia, we´re getting fucked while we´re sleeping
And while we´re busy making ends meet and praying for breakevens
We face another day in the shape of a caged freedom

[Hook - Sicknature]
Hamsterwheel runs, racing with haste
For credits that feed the system
At the end of the day
Its all about the fucking paper we chase
The paper we chase
To buy the same freedom that will pay for the cage (2x)

[Verse 2 - Hasan Salaam]
Another night without sleeping, nother day without eating
Tryna build up the savings so I could buy without leasing
My debt been increasing and its due by the 8th
So when them bill collectors call I'm like "No Habla Ingles"
Everything is out of place, FEDs will build a RICO case
Over mix tapes like I'm pushing weight out of state
Keep some change in a safe and a stash under the mattress
Only render to Caesar's what they could cease for the taxes
Let me explain if you need it broke down
Couple years wiser lotta more know how
Pigs get me cornered I ain't never gon' back down
Go out with a bang like Jomo & the Mau Mau's
Terrestrial flow shit belong in the X-Files
80's baby raised on Reaganomics & crack viles
Problem child I make Mama so proud now
Born to move the crowd direct descendant of Wild Style

[Hook]
