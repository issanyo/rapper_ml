[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]

This a renaissance for the art of making love
Jet Setting round the globe with the Mile High Club
Come fly with us friendly skies above
The ultimate high and baby your my drug
So let me explain that making love in the rain will make your whole life change
Said you like it ruff so every spot gets touched
Foreplay to role-play, ropes and handcuffs
So blow a kiss my way turn up the Sade
Lost in the moment been in it since Friday
Ménage à trois c'est la vi
On you, on her and you're both on me… See

[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Treat Her like a Queen
Fuck Her like a Porn Star x4

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]

I’m a gentleman- open doors and pull out chairs
Behind closed doors- smack ass and pull back hair
Soon as you said King put that right there
Had you up against the wall legs up in the air
So darling move your hips like a lunar eclipse
Honey dipped skin tone been calling for bliss
Could tell how you want it from the way that you kiss
So I keep a wet smile on all four of your lips


[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Treat Her like a Queen
Fuck Her like a Porn Star x4


[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam]

Girl you just like me always stay in the mood
Rest of the world disappear when we get up in our groove
Cocoa butter smooth
Dance step know all the moves
And your legs look amazing is some high heel shoes
Couldn’t choose a favorite body part
It’s all a work of art
You got the Mona Lisa on smash
Said your clothes look good on yah but they look better off yah
So let’s make sure the good shit last
Take um off for me


[Chorus: Hasan Salaam]

Treat Her like a Queen
Fuck Her like a Porn Star x4

[Outro: Hasan Salaam]
I’m baptized in your thighs when your body explodes x3
