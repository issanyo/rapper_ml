[Hook: Sample from Frank Sinatra - "I Wished on the Moon"]
Every night was long and gloomy
Shadows gathered in the air

[Verse 1: Akir]
Yeah
Every night, I tried to write about the urban plight
Trying to highlight moments to shine bright.  “We’ll be aight”
Cops sliding by, trying to get some guy
Crooked.  Seen in it his eyes.  Another nigga took it
Pocketbooks shorter to cook.  Coming back to books
Shorties laughing on the corner ‘cause that nigga’s shook

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]
Another song from the lord every time I tune up
My vocals cords and press Pro Tools and record
Every night, I tally up the abacus.  Broke as fuck
With a wallet full of callouses paying for life’s challenges
Hear the screams of the seeds, mothers waiting
For Maury to tell ‘em who the daddy is.  Sadly, it’s
Getting tougher to love life, so we getting raised
To find a way to pocket sunlight until it’s done right

[Verse 3: billy woods]
Every night, corners tight under lamplight, soft white
Hand-to-hand flight, dreaming pipes, fiends in satellites
He really writes on the handlebars
If traffic bright, exploding cars, holding stolen
Stars for light.  Every night, clutching mics
Folding swollen bars, shrapnel shards [?]

[Hook: Sample from Frank Sinatra - "I Wished on the Moon"] (x2)
Every night was long and gloomy
Shadows gathered in the air

[Verse 4: Akir]
They
Clap at a faggot with a automatic, blast and leave
[?] it’s magic and it tragic
Niggas catching never flashing.  Then they massive
And making a craft is fast, passing the evening hours
Cowards get devoured—even niggas stuck on powder
Got to know some overpowered, claiming that they doubt it

[Verse 5: Goldenchild]
Every night is another chance, last dance
With the Devil.  One foot in the grave, holding the shovel
Soldier for trouble.  [?] clever levels
To maintain obedience, niggas is greedy once
Four cord-rockers.  Turn our death into profits
[?] we ever stopping, keeping this war popping
Feed it to us watching.  When will we ever stop it?
We got to, yo, we got to stand up
And just let them know exactly how
We gots to go.  We gots the shows.  We gots to blow

[Hook: Sample from Frank Sinatra - "I Wished on the Moon"] (x2)
Every night was long and gloomy
Shadows gathered in the air

[Verse 6: Vordul Mega]
Can’t even look.  Every night, you wait
Sometimes dream we could be away from all the stress
Still, we ahead, smoking weed
Lead leaves lead to escapes.  [?]
[?], heads
Rolling, chasing big faces.  Natural-
-born writers vandalize to express
We need papers and high wages.  Mixed
Messages in sky pages to textiles
And amarettos for old boroughs that got
A billy with the TEC out

[Verse 7: billy woods]
Every night, open season
Telescopic sight.  Anything breathing I’m seeing
I’m squeezing strong.  High treason bust the law
Snipe, take off an arm.  Eagles nest calm, hype
Death in the palm, rocking the charm, blunts
Ripe, serenaded by car alarms, siren songs

[Hook: Sample from Frank Sinatra - "I Wished on the Moon"]
Every night was long and gloomy
Shadows gathered in the air

[Verse 8: billy woods]
Cannibals bite bombs, devils spawn laws
Boys man-strong.  White noise, blackened forearms
Horus whirlwinds in the eye of the storm
Unfurling black flags on your lawn, gunpowder warm
Cold fusion burn like Vietnam
Every night, blazing the traum, blazing the traum
Terror Firma
