[Verse 1: Hasan Salaam]
The melodies and harmonies stick to your ribs
Like hominy grits in the winter you dig
As a kid I was raised on the sounds of Motown
From Planet Rock where galactic B-boys throw down
Breath of fresh air in the depths of despair
No matter how bad it get, the music gets there
Park jams remind us of Congo Square
And that feeling gets your ass up like musical chairs
Sang spirituals on the plantation for salvation
From blues shaman to DJs and beat breaking
It's so sacred, just know the ledge
Said if it wasn't for the music I'd be better off dead

[Hook: Baron]
It lifts me up
And calms me down
When I am lost
It's through the sound
I find my inner light through music
Music is my life

[Verse 2: Hasan Salaam]
The vibe that I'm giving you
Been the same since I was rocking James Brown tunes in Mama's Living room
No silver spoon, hairbrush, microphone and a boom box
Lip-syncing to M.J, moon-walking across the spot in some tube socks
From the bricks to the boondocks
Hip hop got the bass bumping up higher than blue tops
Ghetto griots still spitting they oo-ops
Like Pops on the block harmonizing his Doo-Wops
Air guitars turn us all to rock superstars
Hear your song, sing along, no matter who you are!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam]
This is for the Godfather of Soul and Charles Parker
Bird lives in the flatted fifths we play sharper
Bob Marley them no capture fire starter
Big and Pac, still rockin' to the Music of Martyrs
John Lennon, Marvin Gaye, relevant to this day
No bullet could take music away!
Burning Hollywood with P.E leading the way
Yelling fuck the police with N.W.A
Ray Charles sang with 20/20 vision
And Fela's freedom got found in the rhythm
Listened to the pain of Kurt Cobain
And saw God in the notes of Saint John Coltrane
Aaliyah singing proof that angels existed
Jimi Hendrix "Purple Haze" made sure we was lifted
Voice for the voiceless, just gotta say Ashe
Let's keep celebrating Billie Holiday!

[Hook]
