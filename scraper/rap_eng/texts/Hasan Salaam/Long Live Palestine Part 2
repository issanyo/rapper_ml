[Intro]:
Not every Zionist is Jewish
And not every Jew is a Zionist

This is for Palestine, Ramallah, West Bank, Gaza
It's about time we globalized the intifada
Listen close I've got six words for Obama
Long live Palestine
Long live Gaza
Palestine, Ramallah, West Bank, Gaza
It's about time we globalized the intifada
Listen close I've got six words for Obama
Long live Palestine, Long live Gaza

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
The government supports the people of the UK didn't
Zionism is not compatible with Judaism - the hijacked faith
The state is misrepresenting
Israel equals misplacement and ethnic cleansing
I know I'm on a list, for being more verbal, curse every Zionist since Theodor Herzl
Balfour was not a wise man
Shame on Rothschild
Between them the monster they created has gone wild

[(Arabic Translation) Verse 2:Tamer Naffar (DAM)]
We are people who were sieged by the enemy
Betrayed by our brothers
You won't feel heroic [?]
Withdrawal from Iraq, like a locust invasion
Left only destruction
No punishment
How many mouths were silenced?
How many mothers left devastated?
My freedom begins when the one who took it pays the price
Mr. Judge, open your eyes, open your ears
How many evidences scream against him...
Give me my freedom, and tie up his hands

[Verse 3: The Narcicyst]
Tears to laughter
Our children don't fear disaster
Living near the master
Clear the facts
Hear the casket
We rap and we die from bombastic times
Loons have to hide
Summer days in the thunder blaze
They merk their dreams like Theodor Herzl screams
And the UN and 48 Third Intifada
From mothers, daughters
Sons martyred and empty fathers

[(Arabic Translation) Verse 4: Eslam Jawwad]
The right of returned
A whole people got imprisoned
Bullets are falling like rain
Rain is falling hard
Breaths are cut
[?]
Take the bird out of its cage
Go fly away
Go show my blood to the world
This is my sin
I'm waiting for my Savior, for Isa
The only hope I have left is my God

[(Farsi lyrics) Verse 5: Hich-Kas]
Ba inke to televisiona hamash mishinan dorooq migan, dashtam akhbar mididam
Ke chetor ajora roo bache ha va ashkaye madara roo zamin mirizan
Bache ha shirinan
Neshoonash roo bache ei ke taze yad gerefte rah bere o dastesho migiran
Por kard… ba’d, tiri zad
Chand vaght pish sahne haei shabihe ino too chand ghadamim mididam
Ah daram chi migam…

[Hook]:
Free my people, Long live Palestine
We will never let you go

Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine

[Verse 6: Reveal]
Israel is a terrorist state
The evidence is quite obvious
War criminals using lethal weapons like white phosphorus
Burns your flesh to the bone
And if you happen to live
You'll be left infected with cancer
You'll curse the fact that you did
Forgive me if I wish to say fate on those Israelis
Responsible for killing all those innocent little babies
I studied the Torah and learnt by their own admission
Israel's actions are not kosher in their own religion

[(Arabic Translation) Verse 7: Mahmoud Jreiri (DAM)]
I look around me, I find no life
They took my land from under my feet
And gave me only suffering
We used to carry "Torreyeh" (A planting tool)
And God gave us our livelihood
Now we carry a rifle
And on God we depend
Massacre, Slaughter
Everyone has seen it on the screens
Not today, not the West Bank, not Gaza
Look closely in the pages of history
Look at Christ
People are getting crucified in Palestine for over 60 years

[Verse 8: Hasan Salaam]
The Devils got an unholy plan for the Holy Land
So I hold my Quran and
Culture power in the other hand
Damn
No oasis just bloodstained sands
Settlements settin' up to eliminate child, woman and man..
There's no such thing as the Middle East
Brother they deceiving you
No matter where you stand there's always something to the east of you
So whether it's the Mossad or the FBI policing you
It's all one struggle till the final breath is leavin' you

[(Arabic Translation) Verse 9: Shadia Mansour]
(We should, Know, How, [?])
Arabic people, our unity is our skeleton
We should learn how to think
We should learn how to deliver a message without shutting doors in our faces
I wouldn't have known what is good for me
If I haven't seen what is good for others
Take my words as experience, not an insult

(We should decapitate the head of the monster)

So it loses its way, and its true nature revealed

[Hook]

Free my people, Long live Palestine
We will never let you go

Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
