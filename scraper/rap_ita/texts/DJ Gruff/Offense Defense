[Chorus x2]
Offense / Defense
What's your weakness
Run the sequence
What side of the beef is you on?
What team are you for?
Gimme the ball, Imma score!!

[Verse 1]
I'm suited up, got on my uniform
Stretched so my muscles stay warm
On the battlefield
This is a test of your will and your skill
Where the hills and the drills
And pumpin' steel pays off
Its real out here, No days off
I'd rather give up my life than take a loss
Damn right, paid the cost to be the boss
What can i do to get my point across
The goal line
Go hard the whole time
The official blowing the whistle is blind
You got the ball in court
You gotta shoot for the net
You better take your respect!

[Bridge]
When you under the heat
You on the O or the D?
You would never believe
What it takes to get free
Na-Na-Na who's your enemy
Na-Na-Na who's your enemy
Let's Go!

[Chorus x2]
Offense / Defense
What's your weakness
Run the sequence
What side of the beef is you on?
What team are you for?
Gimme the ball, Imma score!!

[Verse 2]
The art of war
More than a metaphor
Who's your competitor
This is more than a sport
This is who you are at your core
A warrior
Losing...destitution
Winning...is euphoria
Hail Mary Overtime
Sudden death field goal
The running back don't stop till he find the hole
Its 40 love
Game. Set. Match. IN!
Second round TKO, the champion
Millions of people screaming
Saying they want the cup
Practice makes perfect
Wanting it ain't enough
Separate the riders from the punks
Slash to the lane
Roundhouse tomahawk DUNK!

[Bridge]
When you under the heat
You on the O or the D?
You would never believe
What it takes to get free
Na-Na-Na who's your enemy
Na-Na-Na who's your enemy
Let's Go!

[Chorus x2]
Offense / Defense
What's your weakness
Run the sequence
What side of the beef is you on?
What team are you for?
Gimme the ball, Imma score!!

[Bridge]
We are the Champions my Friends, We'll Keep on Fighting till the end!
Let's Go!!

[Chorus x2]
Offense / Defense
What's your weakness
Run the sequence
What side of the beef is you on?
What team are you for?
Gimme the ball, Imma score!!
