Tell me why
Baby sit down, can we talk?
Tell me why, why do you stop
Just to start all over again?
I knew from the stars
That this relationship could never be
I guess I know, right from the stars
That it will never be
So tell me why, why do you stop
Just to start all over againï»¿?
Why do you stop just to start all over again?
Tell me why
Tell me why
Just tell me why
Baby why, why do you stop just to start all over again?
