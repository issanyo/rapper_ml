My love for you has leaps and bounds
My heart goes wild when you’re around
Set my heart on a race when I seek your face
I’m so in love with you

You stole my heart from the get go
Now you saying won’t let go
Silly old me thinking you would leave
I’m so in love with you

Feels like I’m dreaming
When I think about you
You’re love and you’re power so
Out of this world
Take my breath away
When I think about you
I’m so in love with you x2

And as I walk this lonely road
You said I’ll lie in a green meadow
You set a table for me in front of my enemies
I’m so in love with you

And as I sing this melody
I feel you smiling over me
Come on say my name
Will I make you proud
I’m so in love with you

Feels like I’m dreaming
When I think about you
You’re love and you’re power so
Out of this world
Take my breath away
When I think about you
I’m so in love with you x2

Don’t wake me coz I’m dreaming love
Dreaming love x4
