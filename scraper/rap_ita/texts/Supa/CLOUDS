[Verse 1]

Why you beefing with a God its
Supa Dupa the head nigga in charge from
KOLD MOB shout out to Richy, Indiyo, Frankie
And all my other niggies
Devilish nigga with the swank of an OG
Niggas try to Go Pro me, but they 3rd eye shut
That's what the fuck is up
When you try to bust on a crew getting buck
Nigga fuck

I'm sicker than that nigga Wayne when he on the lean
Please proceed to drain the brain
Insane in the membrane, smoking on some chemstrain
Supa Supa hot flame
Nigga this is my game nigga you a no-name
And you salty
It ain't my fault, b
I be in the clouds so high with my whole team
Six senses yeah I'm so keen
Lame niggas wanna be me

[Hook]

All the Gods looking down on me
Motherfucking Gods looking down on me
Pass the weed and break it down for me

High off the loud
I'm up in the clouds

All the Gods looking down on me
Motherfucking Gods looking down on me
Pass the weed and break it down homie

High off the loud
I'm up in the clouds

[Verse 2]

I'm just a young nigga who's getting it
Fuck being nice bitch I'm winning
You run to your trunk, get the semi
I wind up and cock back
She pop that then lock that then drop that
I'm winning

Fuck Charlie Sheen bitch
Just me with the clique bitch
Pancakes and waffles
Flip niggas like switches
Leave them in ditches
All of these niggas in here I demand my three wishes

Genie in a bottle you lie more than Obama
Fuck the government they are like a teeter totter
Always switching up just like my flows
Nah they never tell the truth
That's how it goes
3rd eye so high I'm never low
Fuck money fuck all the materials
Materials
Devilish Nigga
Hell is where my spirit goes

[Charles Manson Interlude]
