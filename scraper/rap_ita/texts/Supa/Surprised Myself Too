It's me, yeah
This right here sounds just about right man

[Verse 1: Wem]
I used to be a well kept secret
Did my own thing, now it's big buisness
How I did this I played the game so fearless
Followed my intuition never asking for forgiveness
Now Im on a date with destiny I'm on a mission
Can't reveal it yet make sure you place y'all bets
I'm about to cause change, been formulating my plan
Inspired my whole team, made them all understand
The vision of my decision, how nothing to me was given
Maybe cause I do me is the reason I have these women
And they say I'm about to blow up like I'm causing demolitions
And I'm at the point where idols start becoming competition
Checking my job description feeling like it says a villain
And I know I'm making hits eventually I'm stacking millions
Yes this shit was written and you just became a victim
Of what happens when a genius breaks out of his mental prison

Chorus:
Y'all don't want no problems y'all just want the fame
I'mma get on this TV mama they gon scream my name
Made myself into brand now I'll get the cash soon
I knew that I would make it I surprised your ass too

[Verse 2: Wem]
Some labels ignored me but they are not psychic
They could not see the future not knowing I would be nice, shit
I got the rhyme and reason
If you copied me verbatim you would still be different
And I can spit some wisdom
So while they rapping bout weed I'm just smoking past them
How much you make a verse? It depends who's asking
When I travel it looks like a fucking model casting
At the end of the day I stay killing it
Basquiat scriptures in my brain man they're so scripted
This sounds like an orchestra but this is just a formula
On how to put that work in and get people all on your stuff
How to get some ladies, dress fresh and smoke daily
Gotta do the right thing was born in the late 80s
Thats some food for thought and i served it with a garnish
And its also why girls sleep in shirts with my name on it

Chorus:
Y'all don't want no problems y'all just want the fame
I'mma get on this TV mama they gon scream my name
Made myself into brand now I'll get the cash soon
I knew that I would make it I surprised your ass too
Y'all don't want no problems y'all just want the fame
I'mma get on this TV mama they gon scream my name
Made myself into brand now I'll get the cash soon
I knew that I would make it I surprised your ass too
