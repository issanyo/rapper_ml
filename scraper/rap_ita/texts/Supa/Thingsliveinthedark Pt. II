(Intro)
If I die tonight (Repeat 3x)

(Verse 1)
Lift the suicide doors while talking to the devil bitch I been a rebel/
Living fast with my foot upon the pedal
Tory tooting snorting xanz releasing pressure!/
Fuck a deal giving my truth!
Fuck a meal codeine a do!
Fuck crying we gone do what we do!
Street sweeper treat that K like a broom!
BOOM/
Turn yo face into food!
To kill we AMUNED/
Daddy serving catching all the traction!
Brother brackin catching all the action/
Mommy smoking her and all the attics!
I'm just writing viewing all the tactics/
Came from nothing now we mixing up designer!
Models calling telling me I been the flyest/
Ex bitches tryna run me through the fire!
But this power got me Ghost and I'm with Tommy/
Tommy Gun with a Tommy shirt!
New Kid I was born a jerk/
Young and Thuggin like I'm Lil Turk!
We was piss poor tell me what it's worth/
When you have a passion!
But you steady lagging!
Niggas dying viewing all the tragic/
Nerves bad everyday you panic!
Overthinking tryna find the loops/
We was born to fail we was born to shoot!
But we can make it out! Look at Uncle Snoop/
Look at K.Lamar Look at Cole to!
Look at Wop! I'm just mixing ciroc/
YAK! YAK!
Sacrilegious!
Uncle Tony spending life in prison/
They don't know us!
Only what we give em/
Fuck yo color, creed your ethnicity!
White, Black Asian niggas menace see/
It's about yo action breaking out entrapment!
Nigga fuck the system!
I'm a fucking SAVAGE/
Missing flights cause I'm soul searching!
Really asking what's the soul purpose/
Excluding out the fame!
All the diamond chains/
Rollie watches!
Balmain designer frames/
Passion vital!
So just keep dreaming/
1 dollar I was broke feining!
Riding buses tryna rap freely!
Government play me that GAT SINGING like/

(Bridge)
No Martin! No Kendrick!
But bitch I got a DREAM/
Bitch I got a DREAM!
Lil Kenny got a DREAM!
Talisha Got A DREAM/
The whole ghetto got a DREAM!
When yo luck down just focus on the DREAM/
Don't give up cause everybody has a DREAM!
Keep strong faith and don't let em take the DREAM/

(Verse 2)
Memorizing verses while loading pistols
Calling God but no phone signal/
The sole purpose is to give the visionphysic open third eye extended/
Niggas broke but the dream vivid!
From the Northside where the love timid/
We was born to lose! But was built to get it!
Let's Pray/

(Prayer/Poem)
Father forgive us!
As we know not what we do, but can only grow to understand the path you have paved for each and every chosen soul
It is upon thee to find light in the darkness, it is upon thee to live out he or she's true meaning with the last days upon us
Guide us lord, walk with the chosen  as we trust your vision
In your holy name I pray AMEN!
