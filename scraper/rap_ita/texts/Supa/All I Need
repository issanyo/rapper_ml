See I was raised in the slums
But niggas tote guns distribute and run
Watch out on the one and one servin' the bomb
Niggas talk about Miami but they scared to come
Leavin' they family in danger just to play in the sun
Nigga, we did what you done and what you talkin' about
Like droppin' drugs up out of town and keepin' dope in the house
Ain't give my life to that 'cause it's over and out
That's how it is when you exposed in the south
See

[Hook x2]
All I need is big guns on the side of me
Bout a half a brick of yay and a pound of weed
Straight do or die bitches that'll die for me
How many niggas down to ride with me (Hey, hey)

The reenactment of my first murda
With no remorse and no feelin's
Hell, cuz I ain't even know this nigga
The shit was deep I couldn't just let it go
While I was shootin' bout my money
Fruitin' bout my dough, bitch
I bust his ass like the last muthafucka
Went in with them stunnas, came out with them cuttas, cut up
You shoulda seen the muthafucka jumpin' thumpin'
Bullet after bullet pumpin' fully after fully
You muthafuckas went in bad choppas
I still got em, that nigga begged for his life but I still shot him
I let him know bitch, this is how I feel bout ya
I asked him out but now his momma bout to hear about him
I'm from the era of the goodfellas, you know
Nigga like Big Ike, Big Nose Bob and Bo Dilly
I growed up on the turf watchin' Murph and them
Murph dropped the top on the bird, that nigga was hurtin' them
I take this shit back to thirties and vogue
Let's see that's way before them Bama-ass hammers and loaves
That's in the days when the ave was jumpin'
Ev'ry nigga was gettin' money, every corner was pumpin' and jumpin'
Huh, but now we in the new era
A new game a different thang and a whole buncha new killas
Money, money, money...
E'ery time, goddammit I'll say it e'ery time
Betta call us murderers

The boy think he gettin' payed, jumpin' out
Squeezin' AK's, on the ground they lay
That's how we do this shit in Dade
Killer bee's, snappin' pictures plottin' killin' me
Them killed my dogg, hell naw it couldn't be
Gotta straighten this shit, got SK's with extra clips
Holla "killer head", and make them bitches flip the script
Cut it back to light, fake the left, rip the right
Them feel my eyes, these bitches down to die tonight
Pull right on the side, raise it up squeeze that thang
Went "bang, bang" till their muh'fuckin' brains hang
I live for this, so damn right I kill for this
And when I get that feelin', ain't gon' be no hit or miss
