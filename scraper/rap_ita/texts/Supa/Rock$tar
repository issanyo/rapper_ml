Red Gucci belt chain swing
I can't have no friends cuz all of em changing ay
Spikes on my shoes like a spurr
Imma pop a xanny and wash it down with some purp
Jk
Ray bands on my head like a nerd
Supa is the best forget whatcha heard
Ay
Burn burn burn burn burn
Imma drop a track and yo house gone burn
Ay
Step in the booth gone learn
Whipping with the pot and my wrist gone turn

All of these haters they mad at me
But they bow down when they see me like majesty
I am invading the game like a cavity
I'm going up ion stick with the gravity
Yes I am white and I'm rapping no Matty b
I be flowing on the beats it don't matter b
Take a rapper down and do it so callously
You take a L if u attempt to battle me
Mixing my flow and the words like a alchemy
Hop on the beat you get nervous like out coming
All of the people that's doubting me
They the same ones when I blow up they crowding me
Rapping is me if we talking bout faculties
Losing my sanity
My music fire heart burn need the rantidene
Watch yo profanity live in a fantasy
Ay ay
