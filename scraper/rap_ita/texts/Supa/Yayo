[Hook: Mishon]
That yayo, that yayo, that yayo-o
We get to the money she do what I say so
She holdin' me down we gettin' them Pesos
She fuck me so good that pussy like yayo
That yayo, that yayo, that yayo-o
We get to the money she do what I say so (foreign gang)
She holdin' me down we gettin' them Pesos
She fuck me so good that pussy like yayo

[Verse 1: Supa]
Supa gon’ get to the money
I taught her the game and she love me
I hopped out the porsche, that’s ‘cause she got more
And that was end of discussion
You niggas ball on a budget
[?]
I’m wondering how she’s gonna love me
When all of her people is Muslim
We don’t go together, but we go together
We gon’ grow together
Count this dough together
I gave my agent some [?]
We came to light up the scene
Gave me her finger so she can put on the ring
Ball hard ‘cause she play on my team
Bit like a queen, ‘cause I’m a king
She holding me down on the prince of the yayo
We takin ‘er trill so take cakos
Rio de Janeiro we count Dineros
All these chains I be living like Fero

[Hook: Mishon]
That yayo, that yayo, that yayo-o
We get to the money she do what I say so
She holdin' me down we gettin' them Pesos
She fuck me so good that pussy like yayo
That yayo, that yayo, that yayo-o
We get to the money she do what I say so
She holdin' me down we gettin' them Pesos
She fuck me so good that pussy like yayo

[Verse 2: Mishon]
Yayo, that yayo, that yayo, that yayo-o
I'm fuckin' her down and then we gon' lay low
We pourin' up one then we gon' handsmoke
I’m fuckin' her in a penthouse, so ztell for
Miami, Miami, Miami
I fucked that bad bitch, that's why I'm in Miami
The Puerto Rican, Dominican and the [?]
I fucked her so good she meeting my family
They're a lot young nigga with the gang
They allowed to follow everything we sayin'
Cause I'm motherfuckin' with the dream team
And we going in with money, anythang

[Hook: Mishon]
That yayo, that yayo, that yayo-o
We get to the money she do what I say so
She holdin’ me down we gettin’ them Pesos
She fuck me so good that pussy like yayo
That yayo, that yayo, that yayo-o
We get to the money she do what I say so (foreign gang)
She holdin’ me down we gettin’ them Pesos
She fuck me so go that pussy like yayo
