[Verse 1: Gemitaiz]
It's Gemitaiz still answer "what do you want?"
I've still some poison for you
Point to skyscrapers like the Bad Boy
Flow Makaveli, decreasing with match point
My flow for you is a torture
You can bring whoever you want so it doesn't last
"White out, Niggas in" like in Honduras
Should we do until we crash with tour bus
When I enter on the beat they still looking at me
They are not capable then cry at the foul
On slow beats I'm a vandal
Remember that I am a Jordan, you are a sandal
With two pounds I become E.T
Under the effect of mushrooms, if you let me
I put padlocks on the verses
Only if you stop, you make us happy
Check it, check it, bro let me try
Spit twenty verses with the particular flow
So if you hear them I can make you fly
These pump, exit and other spring, appears
I fire the ball in the hole
I've got the number 9 as Batistuta
My people are talking shit because they lived it
That's why when he listens yo you, my brother spits
I Increase the power, the feeder catches fire
I spit who invents stories in slow motion
Every six words I give you addiction like methadone
Half-human half-clone, I stay out 'till late
Under the sign of the Dragon
I write new bars every night
That if you were to make them, you'd need so much time the planet would die
Bro in this shit I just got elected Senator
Bro in this shit I just got elected Emperor
When I mount it seems to be in another world
And hear this "I don't miss you much"
I send them all home until I scrape the bottom
Flow killer, drug dealer
Don't think that I end up, I got a thousand
No cars, no mansions
What do you think, that I signed with Skrillex?
We're Tanta Roba (Tanta Roba)
The triangle a.k.a. the other artists cry (sorry)
Dani, do you know how many disks are left?
I take a boat with three grams tucked into the shoe
I'm with my brothers that light up at sunrise
I don't like the street because I'm from there, bro (Bye)

[Verse 2: MadMan]
The techniques you're looking for I have
If I make a track on the boom-cha, I'd be denounced
Baby it burns that I rock even if mistake pronunciation
M a shot of Mauser, you're a Taser
So many thrash bars you make, you should take some breaks
You cry in every single
It sounds like you have the MÃ¼nchausen syndrome
The rhymes that you are looking for, I don't spit them, I archive them
You are shit when you rap in studio and live
If you shoot me, I comeback, I'mma revengeful
Living dead, Mad the vampire
Back from the dead, from Charon
Coming from the catacombs, I scale the mount
Your bro runs fast, barriers gates
Because he knows that my flow is a Colt and it breaks brains
I push too much until I double the sound
Smoke opium and close my eyes, Hiroshima
Digging graves like Etna
I climb to the top, releasing bombs like Vietnam, Indochina
Fool, learns his way up, internship
They copy over and over, like China
We eat them like M&M's
M and Gem are like "Rei and Kenshiro", you like "Shiro and Mila"
No I don't I finish, otherwise these people say that I don't want
They do like that girl that doesn't say that she's a bitch
Then she swallows my balls like ravioli
Cuz she says yes like Valsoia
When she is swallowing while I'm driving I set second gear
She indulges me, my penis gets me like a redwood
While drinking Cognac, "Fuck what a shame"
I've been driving around this roundabout for half an hour
Each bar is a Putin ballistic missile
I have the quantum physics' style, you lock yourself
To do it again even if it is impossible, I've seen tributes
I rap for another twenty minutes
Metrically autistic, avantgarde
I studied at the scientific high school, not the artistic
I'm with Labadini, I swollen Napapijiris
Davide is in the other room, rolling papyrus
(We light it up? OK, ok)
Cooker hood in the room
We stare at the ganja that paralyzes
My face really bad but we grind the track apart
You see
I don't watch the prices bro
We buy another four pieces of pakistan
We're going over your eyes backwards
We'll defeat you is evident
I'm in so much, look at me that I burned your taste
On the beats I have no rerets, serial killer
I want to demolish, what can I say?
I just want to die to the Antilles
I don't want to please me
Rapping like a sword for knife
Each bar is my lady to admire
From tomorrow Ramadan, I have too much paranoias
Bro the police is ready to enter
