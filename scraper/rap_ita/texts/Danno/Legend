[Intro]
Yeah
I'm back drinking whiskey
OZ on the beat, yeah

[Chorus]
(I-I)
Needed a reason to go off I think I found one (I think I found one!)
Don't know what legend is until you been around one (been around one!)
We poppin' champagne on a jet, think I been wildin' (you're wild!)
Bottle after bottle, I just drank a gallon (yee! yee!)
Since I was young they say that boy he got some talent (he's good!)
I put some gold up on my teeth and my medallion (bling!)
My favorite time of day, the name my second album (yeah)
The sun go down it's like a monster just came out him
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I just wanna chill and tuck off with a bad one
Man, y'all be stressing me, ah, fuck I need a Valium
I remember when I first made thirty thousand
And now I spent that on some dinner, eat Italian (yeah, linguine!)
We really did it, bruh, we came up from the bottom (yeah)
It's what it is, I swear I see it how I call it (yeah)
I swear you're lookin' like a L, you're not far from it (yeah)
And I just go into the booth and then I vomit (yeah)
The neighbors knocking, all complaining bout the volume (yeah)
I bought the house, bitch I don't understand the problem (yeah)
They bite the swag off, stealing juice, I swear they robbin' (yeah)
I swear my lifestyle '97 Dennis Rodman

[Chorus]
(I-I)
Needed a reason to go off I think I found one (I think I found one!)
Don't know what legend is until you been around one (been around one!)
We poppin' champagne on a jet, think I been wildin' (you're wild!)
Bottle after bottle, I just drank a gallon (yee! yee!)
Since I was young they say that boy he got some talent (he does!)
I put some gold up on my teeth and my medallion (bling!)
My favorite time of day, the name my second album (yeah)
The sun go down it's like a monster just came out him
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I just want to pull off in that Testarossa (Vroom!)
I just sent a text and then that bitch came over (hi!)
Man, I be faded, faded, rarely am I sober (I'm gone!)
And you ain't got it, you a muthafuckin' poser (bitch!)
She wanna fuck, eeh, I'm not mad at it
It's all right there, man, you just gotta go and grab it (yah!)
I text I want her, then I fly her like Aladdin (woo!)
But if she ain't the baddest, then I put her in main cabin (sorry)
They follow me at the party, I walk around it (yeah)
Like, "Is it me, or did this room just get crowded?" (fuck off)
And they's some sixes up in here, like who allowed in? (who?)
She thinks she's got a chance, I really fuckin' doubt it

[Chorus]
(I-I)
Needed a reason to go off I think I found one (I think I found one!)
Don't know what legend is until you been around one (been around one!)
We poppin' champagne on a jet, think I been wildin' (you're wild!)
Bottle after bottle, I just drank a gallon (yee! yee!)
Since I was young they say that boy he got some talent (he's good!)
I put some gold up on my teeth and my medallion (bling!)
My favorite time of day, the name my second album (yeah)
The sun go down it's like a monster just came out him
Yeah

[Outro]
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, yeah
Yeah
Woo!
Yee!
Ha ha ha
