Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling you give love a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sell
You promise me heaven then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison you can't break free

Oh! You're a loaded gun
Oh! There's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling you give love a bad name
A bad, bad name
I play my part and you play your game
Darling you give love -
You give love a bad name

Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your last kiss goodbye

Whoa! You're a loaded gun
Whoa! There's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling you give love a bad name
A bad, bad name
I play my part and you play your game
Darling you give love -
You give love a bad name

Shot through the heart
Shot through the heart
Shot through the heart
Shot through the heart
Shot through the heart
Shot through the heart

No one can save me
No one can save me
No one can save me, the damage is done
No one can save me
No one can save me
No one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling you give love a bad name
