[Chorus]
Baby you seem so far out of reach
That's just what it feels like
Just cause I had to leave don’t mean you ain't the one but shit is just unfair right

[Verse]
Face down with my chest tight
No crown by your bedside
You work hard on your disguise
That I can see past
Honestly it's peace of mind that I need back
I wish I had no idea of how you’d react
But I know you won't give what I deserve
Cause every word you have reserved is so rehearsed
And you know that I've heard it all
So you put up every obstacle
Baby girl it's impossible to get through

[Chorus]
Baby you seem so far out of reach
That's just what it feels like
Just cause I had to leave don't mean you ain't the one but shit is just unfair right

[Bridge]
This ain't my home
I’m not convinced
I take it slow
I can’t resist

[Verse]
I'm faded while I’m drowning so this shit is moving slowly
I guess I only hit you up cause I was lonely
I still remember everything you told me
Like how you on the brink and you miss the old me
Everything changed when I broke through
When I was on the edge and you had no clue
When I had to switch from addy's to the cold brew
I guess I feel the same I miss the old you
Everything you made me go through
You still seem to think that i helped you
Now you wanna act like you don't know me
But I'm the only one who know you

[Chorus]
Baby you seem so far out of reach
That’s just what it feels like
Just cause I had to leave don't mean you ain't the one but shit is just unfair right


[Bridge]
This ain't my home
I'm not convinced
I take it slow
I can't resist
This ain't my home
I'm not convinced
I take it slow
I can't resist
