[Verse 1:GRiMM Doza]
Middle finger to the media
Space traveling through expedia, rhymes is really tough
You cannot see me bruh, I'm feelin' like a holy ghost
I overdose that potent dro until my fuckin' dome explode
The beat got me off into a different realm
Shit is stealth, Like a dragon when I hit the elf
Fire-breathing, high-perceiving, I am not a human being
I'm usually dreamin' that dude be chiefin' that I'm truly eatin'
I am a beast, go research my anatomy
All your rap is weak
I don’t want no money, I just ask for peace
Yet I'm still killin shit till the casket bleed
I grab the piece, then ash the keef
To be the most high cypher
Grow deep inside my wisdom
Got [?] you would die for
Still rapping lyrics harder than a mothafuckin' cyborg
I be on my grind every minute just knowin' that lifes short
I'm fuckin' torched

[Verse 2:Ab$tract]
Lately been wonderin' to myself
Whats in store for me from god
I hope its wealth
Trapped in my mind, in a mirror
Wanna captivity, thinking about my fans
And hoping that they remember me
I'm not the same cuz' my minds cluttered with chemistry
Chemically altered perception so we’re gods individually
So as I sit and jot down these soliloquies
Picture me as an entity writing from my serenity
My soul glows gold, so I'm livin for an eternity
If if the man come and try to murder me, my rhymes harder than a open heart surgery
Lookin' in the mirror like who is this kid
Always trippin' off that acid on some lucid shit(LSD)
Kickin' back, mind in the books tryna be studious
Booty is glued to the chair, this weed got me couched up when I'm in the air

[Refrain]
Peep the mathematics
It's evil in his iris when he pops the acid tablets
He travels backward in time I think hes out his mind
The conscious should be yet the flow is so asinine
Peep the mathematics
It's evil in his iris when he pops the acid tablets
