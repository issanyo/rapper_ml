[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah that sounds just about right
Well you know let's just keep it going
Life just keeps going
Some more bullshit

[Verse 1]
What a cute little head change
Man I need change in my life right now
Never will I put the mic down
Tell your girl to pipe down
This how I feel right now
I'm never changing, I'm always blazing
No longer chasing these steps
I find a mic to grip, I found a world of love
And I found the lies in your script

[Verse 2]
This where it ends
This where I find all my foes and I lose all my friends
Find all my foes and lose all my friends
Don't need to pretend cos
I'ma be okay
Music for your love
It's all that I play
It's all that I make
All your words are fake

[Bridge]
Got a smile on my face
And that's thanks to me
Got a song in my head
That I made to breathe
Got a smile on my face
And that's thanks to me
Got a song in my head
That I made to breathe
