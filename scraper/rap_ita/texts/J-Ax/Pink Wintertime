[Chorus]
Are you living good?
Is your mind right?
Do the memories of me live in your hindsight?

[Verse]
I knew the roads we were wrestling would converge again
Under construction, glad to see you grown into a friend
Been restless and wrecking shit
You gassing me up as usual
Gotta reciprocate the energy
Keep it mutual
Peep the discography
It's all homage to you
Last time we chopped it up
You said you couldn't miss your niece's future
And I feel for that, fuck potential fame and all
Foreign to my father cause the distance let's the mask fall
These true tones of the mold stay closed when I'm home
Except in your embrace
You accepted truth that I was always forced to fake
Especially when Fuad died, can't deny it opened gates
Closet doors shred to pieces
You shoulder really is your greatest feature
Took in my sniffles like they paid a fee to meet you
Looks like my chest still bleeds for you
Looks like my chest still bleeds for you
(So, hey!}

[Chorus]
Are you living good?
Is your mind right?
Do the memories of me live in your hindsight?
