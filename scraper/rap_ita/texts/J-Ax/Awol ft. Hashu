[Intro]

[Verse 1: Jax]

It don't take too much to bring me down, so baby try to keep me up;
And I can tell just by the way you look that you ain't feelin' us;
And it's too much to try to keep you thinkin' that i'm good enough cause you can see right through me and my skin's too cold for you to touch

Baby we've been out of touch
Lately we've been lacking trust;
Lately i've been feeling that you left cause you fell out of love;
But you know we're too fucked up and had too much to give it up;
And you've been down for everything and never gave a fuck

That's why you can fuck with me—
I know that's why you're with me—
I know that's why you want this—
I know that's why you get me—
I know that's why you hate it—
I know that's why you're faded—
I know that's what you want by now but why do you feel so jaded—I

I don't really wanna think about it—
Don't know how i'm feeling—
Cause between money and women i'm still fucked up on commitment—
Ain't fucking with you and I hope that you feel it and I know i'm not home and I know how you're feeling but nobody truly gonn care about you—
Nobody gonn feel you like I do


[Verse 2: Hashu]

I know when you see me…fuck it
I know when you see me..FUCK!
I know when you see me..aaaah...
I know when you see me I go…

I know when you see me it gets harder just for you to breathe—
You look at your new man and ask yourself if maybe you should leave—
Cause I know that you see me runnin' shit with goals I do achieve;
But I remember when you didn't want me how I used to be

I was hopeless; always hoping you would notice me
Now i'm focused on these shows and dough approaching me
As a bonus when I flow I know you know it's me
Cause they always play my shit cause i'm the coldest, see?

I'LL NEVER GIVE A FUCK LIKE A VIRGIN FOR LIFE
THAT'S WHY THESE RAPPERS GET CUT LIKE A SURGICAL KNIFE
THAT'S WHY YOU GO FUCKING WOMEN CAUSE YOU HEARD THAT I'M NICE
SHE HITS YOU WITH THE EXCUSES I HIT HER WITH THE PIPE

I LIKE WHAT I SAW SO I CONQUERED THE GAME
SHE'S BORING, YOU LAME
SHIT IS ALWAYS THE SAME
SHE TELLS ME I'M GOD
I'M FORGETTING HER NAME
AND SHES GETTING [?]
SHE GAVE ME [?]

Damn, what have I become?
I'm so fucking numb
Put another tab right on my tongue
Put myself in danger just for fun
Are you with the gods or are you hanging with some scum?

Damn, that's probably why you're so mad
Cause everybody else is on my gonads
You probably really wishin that we could go back
Cause i'm about to blow we both know that

Think—
Everyone is mad
Teachers used to take it out on me
I hope their anger doubles while i'm tripling their salary
I say what I say no say-overs—
Grinding till I cop that range rover and that Volkswagen on Gladecover
Whipping harder than a pissed off slave owner
WOO


[Chorus]

I'm just sayin'... you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
