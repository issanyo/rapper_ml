[Verse 1: Dee$y]
Middle finger to the media
The ideology been fucking with my brain
When I turn the TV on, another rapper with a chain
He made the sign of the cross, bet he sinnin' backstage
Jesus peice on, jeez loius y'all
The narcotics that he fuckin' with he fiends off
Don't give a fuck about the fans than he feeds off
Credit card bouncin' up and down like a see-saw
Sleepin' on the couch, with his uncle sam
Wait he don't got a Uncle, wait he don't got a dad
Barely growin' out his stubble paused go and get a pad
Causin' trouble on the block, throw him out his dufflebag
Double digit, hustle back, lunch and dinner on a rag
Finger blister, psychedelic motherfucking country band
Life is hellish, hell if If it was sweet then he'd be diabetic
I confess it, steppin' on a unwelcoming welcome mat
Could of been sellin' crack, dressed in all black
Stuck with a metal mouth ever since his jaw cracked
Somebody show me where the mall at
A dollar sign to my name just to show them who to call back

[Verse 2: Blue November]
Heartless, as the weed burns often
If you awful, take caution, no conscious
Too young to give offering
Running out of options I pitch it like Kenny Lofton
I aim proportionate, distorting you in this alternate
Reality, extorting you for a portion bitch
Disregard the ignorance, not what you think it is
Settle for a pebble never, going for the boulder kid
I'm bold as shit, larcenist with a garment
So black that it's so marvelous
Run up inside your parliament
Let off a clip so arsenic
I light the spliff and laugh at it
You wondering where my conscious went
Nigga, check the record never caught but surely repping
It's the Left Field Theory, something eerie
Jax on the boards chopping samples with a sword
And I got my nigga Deesy drafting raps and spitting easy
Cause we running shit
Young niggas on the rise, coming for your damn demise
Even at the fucking darkest
My nigga we still shine
