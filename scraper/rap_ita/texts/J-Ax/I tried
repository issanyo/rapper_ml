[Verse 1]
I think I liked it better when we never said a thing
Think I liked it better (whoa)
I think I liked it better when we never said a thing
(I think I liked it better yeah)
The only feeling that I get inside my chest is fucking numb
I confess I'm so depressed
I hate the person I've become
All these girls seem so impressed but I invest in only one
I think that you only love me whenever I make you cum
Ain't this fun
Ain't this fun
Look at everything you've done
I thought you're to good at acting or I'm just really dumb
Whoa yeah (Whoaaayy)

Okay listen, yeah

[Verse 2]
This everything I intended
I ain't the shit I regret it
Mama said you work so hard
Baby you deserve more credit
Mama I'll leave her beheaded
Then I'll be right out the exit
Have my money by the entrance
No I'm not here to make friendships
I fuck whoever I want
I'mma leave that bitch astonished
I swear to god that my nut is so gross
I think i'mma vomit
It's getting harder to breath
I'm just tryina stay alive
Even if I do not make it
I can say fuck it I tried

[Hook]
Fuck it I tried
Fuck it I tried
Fuck it I tried
Fuck it I tried

[Verse 3]
I got my Demond's
And you got your Demond's
so no need to argue bout who got the most
I get so nervous when you ain't around so I'm sorry if I keep on pulling you close
But I know how this goes
You say you don't wanna hear it cause I turn everything you say to a lyric
Cloves in my eyes while I'm steering
Deja vu from all the shit I be hearing
So I try to fight it
Cause I felt that change in a instant
Only thing time gon' create is some distance
You say you want help but you say no to assistance
Try to tell somebody but you know nobody will listen, yeah

[verse 4 ]
Baby I know how you feel
(How you feel)
Cause you ain't blame shit on the weather
(No)
You said that you wanna die
(No)
I said let's do it together
Baby let's do it together
You so important I can't fucking stand it
I wanna tell you why I be depressed and I am
But I know that you won't understand it
So paranoid always living in Panic
Purses that's filled up with white-out's and Xanax
We fell in love as if it was commanded
This what we wanted just ain't how we planned it
(This ain't how we planned it)
I know that I ain't enough
No matter how hard I try
I know this world is so dark
I know that nothing is right
It's getting harder to see
But I swear that girl you the light
Even if we do not make
I can say fuck it I tried

[Outro]
Fuck it I tried
Fuck it I tried
Fuck it I tried
Fuck it I tried
Fuck it I tried
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah
I think your lips are coated in morphine
Yeah
Fuck it I tried
Fuck it I tried
Fuck it I tried
