[verse 1]
October 1st I was alone
I was only seventeen when I had to leave home
Hadda prove to everybody I'm grown
Hit everything up like I'm in my zone
October thirty first that was the year
I typed out a message that I couldn't send, but...
November first you had a part of me
Came out of nowhere like damn girl you startled me
I've been so hard to reach
Oxytocin in my arteries
Damn this is hard for me
But that's when winter came
December first and you feeling the same
No longer feel pain
Life all around me does not feel the same, no
Cause I had a piece of you
I wanted to be with you
Had so many things that I wanted to see with you
Got so excited when I got to speak to you
You feeling feelings that you never felt
You never felt this way 'bout no one else
You tried to hide it and you tried to fight it, but you can't deny that's the hand you were dealt
I was afraid that you don't understand me til' we had that night with a bottle of brandy
You leaned above me, you told me you love me
Then I said it too and it felt so uncanny
But that shit was real
We had something alive and it was so real
( whoa yeah, yeah )

[verse 2]
January and it started to grow
February and it started to slow
March came around and it started to stop
By April thirteenth it started to rot
I was still willing to sit through the showers
May came around and I didn't see flowers
I saw me texting and calling for hours
What you said was mine I said was ours
We made it to June and almost to July
Maybe we'd make it if you didn't lie
Maybe we'd make it if you didn't show up wearing nothing under them clothes from that guy
But you always felt the need to be faded
So quick to tell me everything you hated about my songs
About me in general
Don't want excuses and you gave me several
You change with seasons cause your love is temporal
Fueled by the jealousy or by the chemicals
I ignore my feeling when I was skeptical
And I still chose to put you on a pedestal

[verse 3]
You got the mightest touch
You turn everything you touch into gold
What you don't know is that you took my soul
You took it all when you turned me to gold
You've got the mightest touch
I hope that I shine enough
My next girl can blame you if I'm not alive enough
Everyone telling me what you would do
Everyone asking me how would you let her
I would just tell them that it would get better
But damn I guess it wasn't worth the wait
I'm guessing all the parties wasn't worth the cake
Cause all you ever wanted was to do what you wanted
And really all I ever wanted was your time of day
I need a second right now
I need to figure this out
I gave you everything til' I had nothing and when I had nothing you said you want out
Oh, how could you lie to me
How could you lie to me
You said you loved me
I thought you would die for me
Chilling backstage at my shows and you ain't to the side of me
Said that you fucking despised me
Asking myself why you do this
I only focus on you and the music
What about that is so fucking confusing
You want to say that I'm way to obsessive
I wanna say that you're way to aggressive
You wanna say that I'm way to possessive but too many times you were too fucking reckless
Like I was just calling, you never pick up
You was just driving and driving you drunk
You crashed your car and then told me you sorry but did it again by the end of the month
Why you always gotta talk bout your exes
Why you always got to talk bout a next bitch
Why can't you ever take anything serious
How come I am always all the defensive
Why was there always another one
Why did you ruin my graduation
Why couldn't you be there for me and not let me go into isolation
You got a past full of bad decisions and too many functions
Too many nights that you don't remember, so you could feel something
Too many people you slept next to claiming that it was nothing
Too many things I wish I knew but you left out of discussion

[verse 4]
Hennessy and jealousy don't mix
No matter what you did, I thought I saw a shoulder that I could fix
But now I got all of these trust issues because I thought I could put my trust in you
And all of those thing you put me through, all because I wanted it just me and you
Now all these months with no texts
No texts
No calls
You haven't hit me up
You haven't hit me up at all
October first now, we back in the fall
And I'm back to doing nothing but staring at the wall
I don't want you back, I just want an apology
You promised you wouldn't do this
Hard to me
Judge me before we met
You knew about my scars
You lied to me when you said you loved me
Now I know who you are

[outro]
I hope there's someone out for you
I hope there's someone that...
I hope he finds you
I hope he finds you
I hope you're someone that he can lie to
I hope you realize you feel the way I do
But imma be gone so I can't hide you


I hope he finds you
I hope he finds you
I hope you're someone that he can lie to
I hope you realize you feel the way I do
But imma be gone so I can't hide you
