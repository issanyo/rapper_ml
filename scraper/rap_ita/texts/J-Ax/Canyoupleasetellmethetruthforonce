[Verse 1]
Hold you so tight that I think my hands might start bleeding
And now you got me praying to a god I don't believe in
Like we were so good and I waited for so many reasons
After you left I let how it is, your calling season
So I turn my head, cause I don't think I could bear it
Like your love was mine, but I found out that you shared it
And I don't know how much of me left inside you perished
But I hope you find me
Because I know every time you look me in my eyes you judge me
This world is so cold and I can't breath, oh please just touch me
Sometimes when we talk I forget that you do not love me
I cannot feel you ever, not even when you fuck me

[Verse 2]
I should have told you that you never changed, only hoped too
And I know the truth every time that you lie
But I put all of that to the side just to hold you
Well since you lied to me about you, I fucking hate you
I despise you
And there is no part of you left in me
So I do not care if I don't find you

[Vesre 3]
Damn I sound just like you
Words cut so deep it makes me want to vomit
But I cannot lie to you
So I think it might be better for me to be honest
I thought about you everyday since you left
And I always knew there was somebody else
And every letter I wrote I hope you kept
But fuck you for leaving me here by myself
I know I could never hate you
You hurt me so bad now you hate me
But honestly I think I made you
Cause I know that you fucking made me

[Outro]
Like
can you please tell me the truth for once
can you please tell me the truth for once
can you please tell me the truth for once
Tell me the truth
can you please tell me the truth for once
can you please tell me the truth for once
I love you enough for the two of us
( I love you enough for the two of us )
can you please tell me the truth for once
can you please tell me the truth for once
can you please tell me the truth for once
Tell me the truth for once
can you please tell me the truth for once
can you please tell me the truth for once
I love you enough for the two of us
( I love you enough for the two of us )
