[Chorus]
I love how you look when you're naked
Everything about you natural like you don’t even gotta fake it
Never thought of you as ice cold but thinking bout it got me anxious
You know me just a Florida boy with no patience

[Verse]
I love how you look when you're naked
I can tell you holding back though and I don't know if I can take it
Personality is proven
Eat the pussy like it’s sacred
Between you and the money I don't even know what I'm chasing
I do it with no hesitation
Cause I know that we gonna make it
Me and my boys goin psycho living off every pay check
Wish we was out of Ohio living without a location
You can see us with our eyes low
[?] we got a vacation
Mix it all up with the butane
We fiending for elevation
I know when you're with that dude
Yeah you find a new replacement
Now we got a situation
Where I gotta keep you in close range
Cause I ignore all of the facts when I know that they don't change

[Bridge]
I love how you look when you're naked
I love how you look when you're naked
I love how you look when you're naked
I’ll always be down for you baby so don’t you mistake it

[Chorus]
I love how you look when you're naked
Everything about you natural like you don’t even gotta fake it
Never thought of you as ice cold but thinking bout it got me anxious
You know me just a Florida boy with no patience
I love how you look when you're naked
Everything about you natural like you don't even gotta fake it
Never thought of you as ice cold but thinking bout you got me anxious
You know me just a Florida boy with no patience

[Verse]
Miles up like we in flight
No you never been to this side
No I'm only going inside
Oh baby it was implied
And you’re in flight and my inside is me inside of your insides
But I guess it's different this time
Cause look at the corner we backed in
Similar cycles we trapped in
All the details and attachments
Looking back on you like past tense
Slippy yeah I'm losing traction
Tryna make sense of what happened
When you knew love and compassion
And you only knew me as Jackson
But now you're in a different place with a different face and a different person
I can see that your new man look like me just a cheaper version
Never have your mind made so it's hard to tell when you pull the curtain
And you say you're certain but you gotta spark when you realize there's no point in searching
Oh no
I'll throw the bag in the back of the cab and I'll go
And I know you want him to fuck you like me but he don't
And I know you know he away so baby come home

[Chorus]
I love how you look when you're naked
Everything about you natural like you don't even gotta fake it
Never thought of you as ice cold but thinking bout it got me anxious
You know me just a Florida boy with no patience
I love how you look when you're naked
Everything about you natural like you don't even gotta fake it
Never thought of you as ice cold but thinking bout you got me anxious
You know me just a Florida boy with no patience
