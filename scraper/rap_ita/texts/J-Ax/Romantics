[Verse]
It ain't out the ordinary
For me to come at inconvenient times
I pull up inside your city
To make sure that you don't keep me on the side
Like oh
Fucking up the plans the you made
But the anxiety at an all time high
Any time that we separate
I just wanna uh
I just wanna uh
I don't wanna fight
I just wanna fuck
Never satisfied
I can't get enough
Baby going right till I bust
I told you I'll be gone
I'll be right back
Baby tell me where you're staying
Where your mind at
Play me with a grin
Make me sound like a fool
But I know it ain't the truth when it's like that

[Chorus]
I stay right in the real without a thing to prove
I don't trust a single thing you say or do
But I can't deny I'm surprised
Look at us you and I cause we never planned it
But imma stand by through the lust and the lies cause I've always been one for romantics oh yeah

[Verse]
Go ahead and give it to me straight
On my case cause I always make you wait
I be showing up like 30 minutes late
But tell me bout the difference does that the 30 minutes make
When my hands slide down to your waist
Baby keep it goin keep up with the pace
Imma eat your pussy out until my tummy ache
I don't feel to guilty bout me having no restraint
Like baby they'll be no restraint from me
Like no restraint from me
Like I can't concentrate with all these games you play with me
Why you complicating things it clearly takes a toll
I'll change my ways
Cause you say I won't

[Chorus]
I stay right in the real without a thing to prove
I don't trust a single thing you say or do
But I can't deny I'm surprised
Look at us you and I cause we never planned it
But imma stand by through the lust and the lies cause I've always been one for romantics oh yeah
I stay right in the real without a thing to prove
I don't trust a single thing you say or do
But I can't deny I'm surprised
Look at us you and I cause we never planned it
But imma stand by through the lust and the lies cause I've always been one for romantics oh yeah

Iâ€™ve always been one for romantics
Always been one
Always been one for romantics
Romantics
Yeah
