I can't think
They don't want us
They don't trust us
They don't love us
I got all these things
They all try to judge
They all [?]
They don't love us

[verse 1: Hashu]
I woke up this morning
And I popped a pill
Cuss everything is dark
And getting darker still
I try to kill my demons
Theres a lot to kill
So i pop a couple more
So as not to feel
Its hard to write songs
When you don't feel a thing
But i have had these dreams
Its time to reel them in
Cuss its to late to quit i gotta steal the win
The kid is a legend
So bitch you better kneel to him
Oh whoa
I am the greatest
I am ashamed that i still have to say this
Cuss i have been named by the gods as the latest
Rapper out my city to make it
I'm famous
You
Thought id never thought id make it this far
I strayed from he fake shit and aimed for the stars
While you basics were hating
You lames are subpar
I just stayed in my lane
Took my pain and my scars
And i turned them into something
I can kill them with
Never fuck with simpletons
Who try to rob my dividence
Delt with shit thats crippling
My tolerance is infinite
Why did you think you could hurt me
Bitch you need to think a bit
My entire life they couldn't tell me nothing
Cuss i had always know that this was just coming
Ill do this shit myself theres no one else I'm trusting
Ill be the coldest mother fucking up in hell just stunting

[Verse 2: jax_ ]
No no no
They don't even love us
No they don't even want us
They don't wanna trust us
They just wanna be one of us
They just wanna say that
They were there throughout the come up
But I'm in a forrell
Bitch you know that I'm swerving
I got no fucking time
But manage to put the work in
I got all these fucking problems
And a pistol ain't working
You should probably get your girl
Cuss she stay on the lurking
Cuss you know that [?] got me fucked up for a minute
But thats normal shit
Ima put it in a song
And I'm gonna hit a lick
Call up dylan and alex and we gon rage like lunatics
We been getting crazy
Cuss no one out here doing it
Ain't no time for chillin
Im trying to make a killing
I've been busy getting these bitches up in they feelings
I wanna know
Why none these people around till they think we gon blow
We live it up
All of these bitches
They don't give a fuck
Running around claiming they only want love
17 and she only in love with drugs
Trying to move my momma out on the sand
Proving that her baby boy is a man
Do it alone
No one know who i am
Do it alone by myself
