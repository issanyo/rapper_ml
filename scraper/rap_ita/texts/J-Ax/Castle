On my own, solid bones
I've got locks on every door
On my throne, sticks and stones
Love won't break me anymore

Bring in the diamonds
Bring in the gold
Call me your highness
And do what you're told
What you're told
In my castle made of stone
In my castle made of stone

On my own, solid bones
I've got locks on every door
On my throne, sticks and stones
Love won't break me anymore

Bring in the diamonds
Bring in the gold
Call me your highness
And do what you're told
What you're told
In my castle made of stone
In my castle made of stone
