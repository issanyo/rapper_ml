Mr. Harry Potter take your daughter to the Braves
Hear them hollar when my collar gets a couple chains
Call me Walter making offers then I let it rain
When i saw her like a doctor I relieved her pain
She's at my house
Again, again, again
Up in the south
No I can't complain
Word of mouth
I can't be contained
Up on a cloud
Flying like a plane
Yeah I changed
What did you think, I'd stay the same?
I dont blink if I aim
Click the link read the name
Aye
Jack Stacks coming back
Making tracks off my Mac
With RND the team we scheme till we achieving our dreams
Las palmas eat the chips and melted cheese
Georgia heat, in the breeze smell the THC
Ready Now Dynasty serving it finally I know its rap but I can not fight the modesty
On a slope hope my record stays clean (soap)
Yeah I moped when they killed Snoke, what a joke
To my folks know that your son had to go
Had to grow, bout to end this with a solo
