My whole is been a race against time
Since I was a kid particularly keen
[?]
But at the age of 20
I had to front the devil face to face
[?] from which you can't escape
A palace made of smoke [?]
And everything you touch inside of it
[?] joke
[?]
I could tell about the smell yo
There's no return when you ring the devil's bell
Seems to me this battle wouldn't be over 'til I die
I get the same fucking smell [?] smoke up in the sky
I wonder if there ever be a place up there for me
Where I can rest in peace and [?] for eternity
But what the fuck!?
My brothers told me [?]
Tomorrow's another day
Nah, nigga, [?]
You see the devil got me hanging to a rope
And everything I touch [?] in a motherfucking smoke
