Shall I go, shall I stay
107 light years away?
Many times, so many doubts
But no reason, to talk about

Mission is over, mission is done
I will miss you children of the sun
Now it's time, to go away
Goodbye, goodbye Milky Way

For a better world, without hate
Follow your heart, believe in fate
Only visions, and the mind
Will guide you, to the light

Mission is over, mission is done
I will miss you, children of the sun
Now it's time, to go and say
Goodbye, goodbye Milky Way

Mission is over, mission is done
I will miss you children of the sun
I go home, until someday
I say goodbye, goodbye Milky Way!

In 5 billion years
The Andromeda galaxy will collide with our Milky Way
A new, gigantic, cosmic world, will be born
