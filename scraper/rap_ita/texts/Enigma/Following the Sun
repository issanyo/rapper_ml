Following the sun, to find the one
Who's giving you the wings, to fly
Following the sun, the golden one
Losing sense for space, and time

I'm following the sun

To find the one
Can you feel, the waves of life?
Can you hear, the sigh of love?
Do you believe in it?

Following the sun, just for the one
Till you'll find the door, you thought
Following the sun, like everyone
Just searching for a sign, of hope

I'm following the sun

To find the one
Have a look up to the sky
See the billion stars above
Cause maybe on one of them
You'll spend your further life

Cause maybe on one of them
You'll spend your further life

I'm following the sun

To find the one
Can you look up to the sky?
See the billion stars above
Cause maybe on one of them
You'll spend your further life

(Following the sun)
Cause maybe on one of them
You'll spend your further life

(Following the sun)
Cause maybe on one of them
(Following)
You'll spend your further life
(Following)
