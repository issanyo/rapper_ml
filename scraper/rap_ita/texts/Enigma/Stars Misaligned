I stare into the night; gazing at the moonlight
It had always felt the same but tonight, it does not look right
The stars seem to have formed asterisms in shapes beyond my perception; leaving me to wonder, Is it me or are my eyes being deceived?

I cannot comprehend this phenomenon before my eyes: The spheres in the sky are shifting; becoming misaligned

I question my vision, for it leaves me in awe when I think of how what I see before me had formed from a state of mere nothingness

I cannot comprehend this phenomenon before my eyes: The spheres in the sky are shifting; becoming misaligned
I simply can't explain these patterns that I observe: These luminous lights show me something that I wouldn't have realized

As I see beyond the dark horizon, my mind slips into a state of curiosity about whether or not these stars bear any meaning to my life's purpose
I must now seek to fill this void inside my head to determine how these constellations affect my reality

The more I stare into the night, the less I am satisfied
I look to the Sun for an answer but the more that I stare, the more that I blind my eyes

My passion fuels me to grasp and to understand a buried connection to the universe and my existence, but to discover this link implies that my discovery is inevitable; this now, I realize

So here I lay with my eyes fixated to the myriad of spheres in the sky
It is here that I discover that my eyes widen to my mind beginning to narrow
