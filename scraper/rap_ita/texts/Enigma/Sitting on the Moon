I am sitting on the moon
Watching planet blue, hello
Looking all around
Rotating without sound
Where are you?

Where are you?
I am sitting on the moon
Where are you?
I am missing... I am missing you

I came from very far
A little unknown star, hello
I don't know what to do
It is so cold and blue, without you
Where are you?

Where... where are you?
I am sitting on the moon
Where are you?
I am missing... I am missing you

Where are you?
I am sitting on the moon
Where... where are you?
I am missing... I am missing you

Where are you?
I am sitting on the moon
Where are you?
I am missing... I am missing you
