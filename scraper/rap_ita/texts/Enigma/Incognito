Like a shadow on the wall
You were coming, you best go
Not protected by the law
But still... incognito

You're capturing my soul
They don't want it, you best go
Who you are, nobody knows
Can't get behind incognito
Incongnito

Like a shadow on the wall
Free access through around the world
Who you are, nobody knows
Eyes without face incognito

Sade, dit moi

(Reversed)
Like a shadow on the wall
Free access through around the world

Sade, donne moi

(Reversed)
Like a shadow on the wall
Free access through around the world

(Reversed)
Like a shadow on the wall
Free access through around the world

Like a shadow on the wall
You were coming, you best go
Not protected by the law
But still... incognito

Like a shadow on the wall
Free access through around the world
Who you are, nobody knows
Eyes without face incognito

Incognito

(Incognito.)
