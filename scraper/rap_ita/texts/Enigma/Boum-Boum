My heart goes boum boum boum
Every time I think of you
Inside It's boum boum boum
Lost control what shall I do?

Cause I wanna be your lover, (Your lover)
Till the end of our lives, (End of our life)
I could never miss again
These loving eyes
Oh boum boum boum. (Boum boum boum)

My heart goes Boum Boum Boum
Every time I think of you
I feel it boum boum boum
No control of what I'll do

Simplicity, complexity, oh what a tragedy
Reality, insanity, strange normality
Incredible, untouchable, oh but just visual
And I want you, Just you
Oh boum boum

Oh, my heart goes boum boum boum
When my mind is touching you
I'm going boum boum boum
Only light inside my gloom

Cause I wanna be your lover, (Cause I wanna be your lover)
Till the end of our lives. (Till the end of our lives)
I could never miss again
These loving eyes
Boum boum

My heart goes boum
My heart goes boum. (Boum boum)

My heart goes boum
My heart goes boum. (Boum boum)

My heart goes
My heart goes boum boum boum boum boum

My heart goes boum
My heart goes boum boum boum boum boum
