Embryos evolving into psychotic, sociopathological beings of destruction while the rest of humanity devolves into decay
Pestilent viruses beneath the flesh, they consume everything that comes to cross their path
Slowly, the end of the world is impendent

Have you ever looked at humanity and wondered about how it could seem that they come across as senseless creatures? Maybe it could be that in their minds, they hold unsympathetic feelings towards everyone around them for their own self-interests

They disguise ill feat through euphemisms aimed their fellow man
Their words are merely self-gratification

I find no difference between man and the rest of the biosphere but behold ourselves atop only due to our desire… desire to dominate

Our collective mortality keeps on getting stronger by the day because of our instinctual inclinations to survive our habitat, but with each day we grow an unsettling understanding of humanity
In return, our tolerance weakens

I find no difference between man and the rest of the biosphere but behold ourselves atop only due to our desire… desire to dominate! We are a confusing species to comprehend because there is more to us aside from the blood flowing through our veins

As I mark these words about my views on humanity, I must understand that my body and mind bears a resemblance to that of the species that I disgrace
I've now begun to realize the denial of my own significance

With this realization of my thoughts, I conclude this life no longer bears any meaning
Seeing now that I am among those I despise, it is vital that I must take this life
