I'm out on a new road in search for a land with no name
And I never look back cause I'm walking through sunshine and rain
I'm a man who has lived in the tombs and who's broken the chains

Amen
Amen

I was blind and now I see
What if god is not for me
And I know it's time to go
I've been used and I've been played
I've been spat on and betrayed
And I know it's time to go

(Watch out) I defeat the pain
(Watch out) I'm alive again
The past is gone for good, .it's time to say:

Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen

At last, I believe I will be found
In the silence of my nights
I can hear a distant voice
Someone out there is calling my name

(Watch out) I'm not afraid
Watch out
I'm beyond the dread
It's time to turn the page and love again
(Watch out) I defeat the pain
(Watch out) In a crying game
I'm leaving all my shadows behind

Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
