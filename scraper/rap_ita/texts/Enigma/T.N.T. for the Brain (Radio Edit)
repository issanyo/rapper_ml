Smell your skin, feel your breath
You on my side, I couldn't resist
I hope you'll understand some day
What's the meaning of this crazy game
It is real and pure, T.N.T. for the brain
T.N.T. for the brain
Smell your skin, feel your breath
You on my side, I couldn't resist
T.N.T. for the brain
T.N.T. for the brain
