Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life is a roundabout
A kind of LSD
Turn around, have faith in all the changes
Turn around and you will feel
No age of loneliness
You are a part of me

Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and I will show you something

Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life is a roundabout
A kind of LSD
Turn around, have faith in all the changes
Turn around and you will feel
No age of loneliness
You are a part of me

Turn, turn, turn around
(Beyond the Invisible, The Prism of Life)
Turn, turn, turn around
(The Child In Us, Gravity of Love)
Turn, turn, turn around
(Morphing Thru Time)
Turn, turn, turn around

Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life is a roundabout
A kind of LSD
Turn around, have faith in all the changes
Turn around and you will feel
No age of loneliness
You are part of me

Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life is a roundabout
A kind of LSD
(Turn, turn, turn around)

Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life is a roundabout
A kind of LSD
(Turn, turn, turn around)

T..t..t.. turn around and I will show you something
