I look into the mirror
See myself, I'm over me
I need space for my desires
Have to dive into my fantasies
I know as soon as I'll arrive
Everything is possible
Cause no one has to hide
Beyond the invisible

"Sajaja bramani totari ta, raitata raitata, radu ridu raitata, rota..."

Close your eyes
Just feel and realize
It is real and not a dream
I'm in you and you're in me
It is time
To break the chains of life
If you follow you will see
What's beyond reality

"Ne irascaris Domine
Ne ultra memineris iniquitatis:
Ecce civitas Sancti facta est deserta:
Sion deserta facta est:
Ierusalem desolata est:
Domus sanctificationis tuæ et gloriæ tuæ..."

"Sajaja bramani totari ta, raitata raitata, radu ridu raitata, rota..."

Close your eyes
Just feel and realize
It is real and not a dream
I'm in you and you're in me
It is time
To break the chains of life
If you follow you will see
What's beyond reality
