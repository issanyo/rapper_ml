I am hunted by the future
Will the future be my past?
Or is time a fade out picture
Of my everlasting cast?
Love is phasing, love is moving
To the rhythm of your sight
I get closer
To the crossing point of light

(Sanctus, sanctus dominus deus sabaoth
Pleni sunt cæli et terra gloria tua
Hosanna in excelsis, benedictus...)

Let us try to live our lost illusions
They're the Sun at night
If we don't, we'll never taste
The spice of life
And when it seems that we're in a dead end street
There's no reason to cry
'Cause we have a helping hand who's always aside
Forever light

(Sanctus, sanctus dominus deus sabaoth
Pleni sunt cæli et terra gloria tua
Hosanna in excelsis, benedictus...)
