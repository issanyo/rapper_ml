My mind convinced me to believe that I am at liberty to control the path to my own destiny
Through my ambition, I strived to create a world where I would reign upon all that lies in front of me

But my cognition barricades my understanding that my decisions are a product of what surrounds me
So I bear witness to the consequence of my reactions towards what is standing right before me

My curiosity leaves me yearning for comprehension of my true self and retention of my identity
My perception of the universe holds no explanation for the veil I vaguely see

But my cognition barricades my understanding that my decisions are a product of what surrounds me
So I bear witness to the consequence of my reactions towards what is standing right before me

Asserting the demise of my autonomy is the realization of my inability to control my reflection, my fate, and what remains
