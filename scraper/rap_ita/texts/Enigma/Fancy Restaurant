[Verse 1: MP On the Track]
Hold up wait a minute let me get it back, let me get you back
We sitting down on a nice looking restaurant with some nice clothes they playing jazz ok
This setting is so indescribable you looking so amazing that shit is crazy
You look unrecognizable lets eat some food that we can’t afford uh
While were waiting on the food lets talk about ourselves like the time you fell For me
But lets talk about how I felt cause you know I love you
So much that the world can't get ahold of us A lot that ill do for us
Ill give you shoulder rubs and anything you want

[Chorus: MP On the Track]
This is the best part of the night
Eating with you is what I like
You know that I been holding you down
I know that you been curving these clowns
Yeah yeah
Cause you know ill be around
This is the best part of the night
Eating with you is what I like
You know that I been holding you down
I know that you been curving these clowns
Yeah yeah
Cause you know ill be around

[Verse 2: E-Nigma]
Palm trees and some blue skies would be the perfect setting
All we need is a fitted tux and a pretty dress for the perfect wedding
I found a angel that fell straight from heaven
You a blessing please don’t be a lesson
This time with you girl I’m not regretting
Every night with you is just a perfect ending
Tell me all your deepest secrets
I want your heart I need to reach it
My religion girl I’m gonna preach it
Everything about you girl I need it
I been searching for the perfect one
I’m glad I found you there’s no other one
You shining bright just like the morning sun
I wanna have you wetter than a water gun
I can see you had a broken heart
I wanna fix it tell me where to start
Build you up when you fall apart
You should always know that your a work of art
Can we go and do some stupid shit
You the only one I’m fucking with
Caught a vibe ain’t getting rid of it
And I see ya smile you fucking with the kid

[Chorus: MP On the Track]
This is the best part of the night
Eating with you is what I like
You know that I been holding you down
I know that you been curving these clowns
Yeah yeah
Cause you know ill be around
This is the best part of the night
Eating with you is what I like
You know that I been holding you down
I know that you been curving these clowns
Yeah yeah
Cause you know ill be around
