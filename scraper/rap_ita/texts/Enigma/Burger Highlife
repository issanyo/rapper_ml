Ko-Jo Cue

[Verse 1: KO-JO Cue]
Chaley, when I'm drowning with this piece of mine
Is practically the only time I find peace of mind
Stress dey weigh my mind but every time I light a blunt
My mind state seems sublime
Chaley, girl on my case say I dey bolo too much
Tell her she needs to light one, she dey worry too much
Elevated, and I left my troubles on the ground floor
Its downpour makes me hold on to the rush
Of getting faded, cos even though I'm stealing bread
To get high, when I'm sober, I'm a living dead
So hollow, sick to my bone marrow, oh capo
Without it, check like I'm not even there
So I stray to it, I'm chained to it
And yet I master my thoughts when I'm a slave to it
Don't judge me, cause you dunno how I feel
You no fit judge me, cause you dunno how it feels

[Hook: KO-JO Cue]
Hey,  ɛmmfa wo Reggae mmɛsɛe me burger highlife o
Me Burger Highlife o koraa
Na me no me si hɔ no, m'ayɛ wild o
Chale m'ayɛ wild o paa
Ɛmmfa wo Reggae mmɛsɛe me burger highlife o
Me Burger Highlife o koraa
Na me no me si hɔ no, m'ayɛ wild o
Chale m'ayɛ wild o paa

[Verse 2: KO-JO Cue]
Can't stay away from my phone, cos off twitter, I'm a nobody
But on here, I be gold paddy, my opinion counts
People love me for my tweets paddy
Oh gosh, I get a rush from all of my re-tweets paddy
People follow me and tell me I be cool kid
Start trends, make friends, real life I no fit do this
Nti sɛ me bundle sa a, na me turkey aba
Gyesɛ me kɔ recharge 30 Ghana
Making a life off making people look bad to look good
Slander celebrities I love, just to look cool
No be my fault, their attention is my weakness
Cause I know I may never get to meet them
But when they mind me, my self esteem rises
I need the validation & so I keep typing
Don't judge me, cause you dunno how I feel
You no fit judge me, cause you dunno how it feels

[Hook: KO-JO Cue]

[Verse 3: M.anifest]
(M dɔ dɔ ti dɔ. Is this my Cue? Hahaha)
Chaley, I met this dark skinned bibinii black chick
She had me smiling three times chaley a hat-trick
But the fact is, I need sika in piles, like Oscar m'ayɛ wild
Enti mmaapɛ no me de atɔ nkyɛn, hmmph wow
That was such a lie, football age
New chapter of my life but the same damn page
I want people to like me, Facebook fan page
My drive like corruption in Ghana, on a rampage
But I digress; sometimes my emotions are a mess
Cos I've not reached my peak, at least not yet
Am I Kwame? Am I Amet? Or M.anifest
Open these big things in front of me, Yvonne Okoro’s chest
M’adane Adane Best, My strange voice go go far
Me relax on a sofa? A faux pas
Hungry, guess I need a butler, no Oprah
Intoxicated with thoughts especially when I'm sober, paddy-man

[Hook: KO-JO Cue]

[Bridge: KO-JO Cue]
Huh, audio cocaine
I chase it let it cure my pain
Mommy say e go drive me insane
And she’s prolly right, but everybody needs a high in life
What be your cocaine?
Chase it let it cure your pain
Mommy say e go drive you insane
And she’s prolly right, but everybody needs a high in life

[Hook: KO-JO Cue]

[Outro: KO-JO Cue]
Dedicated to anybody who ever had an addiction , you know?
If you've ever been addicted to somebody, something or Just anything at all
I want you to know that it's very normal, everybody needs a high in life
