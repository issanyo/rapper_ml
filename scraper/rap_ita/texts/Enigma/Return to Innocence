[Vocal Sample: Difang and Igay Duana]

[Verse 1: Angel X]
Love - Devotion
Feeling - Emotion
Don't be afraid to be weak
Don't be too proud to be strong
Just look into your heart my friend
That will be the return to yourself
The return to innocence

[Vocal Sample: Difang and Igay Duana]

[Hook: Angel X]
The return to innocence

[Verse 2: Angel X]
If you want, then start to laugh
If you must, then start to cry
Be yourself don't hide
Just believe in destiny
Don't care what people say
Just follow your own way
Don't give up and use the chance
To return to innocence

[Vocal Sample: Difang and Igay Duana]

[Spoken Interlude: Sandra]
That's not the beginning of the end
That's the return to yourself
The return to innocence

[Vocal Sample: Difang and Igay Duana]

[Spoken Outro: Sandra]
That's the return to innocence
