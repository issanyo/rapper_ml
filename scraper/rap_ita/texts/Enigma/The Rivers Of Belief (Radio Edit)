If you believe in light, it's because of obscurity
If you believe in joy, it's because of sadness
And if you believe in God, it's because of the devil
Take me back to the rivers of belief
Take me back to the rivers of belief, my friend
I look inside my heart, I look inside my soul
I promise you I will return
And when the Lamb opened the seventh seal, silence covered the sky
Take me back to the rivers of belief
Take me back to the rivers of belief, my friend
I look inside my heart, I look inside my soul
I'm reaching out for you, let's hope one day
We'll rest in peace, on my rivers of belief
