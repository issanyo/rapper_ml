O fortuna, velut luna

Turn around, and smell what you don't see
Close your eyes, it's so clear
Here's the mirror, behind there is a screen
On both ways, you can get in

Don't think twice before you listen to your heart
Follow the trace, for a new start
What you need, and everything you'll feel
Is just a question of the deal

In the eye of storm you'll see a lonely dove
The experience of survival is the key
To the gravity of love

O fortuna, velut luna

The path of excess leads to the tower of wisdom
The path of excess leads to the tower of wisdom

Try to think about it
That's the chance to live your life and discover what it is
What's the gravity of love

O fortuna, velut luna

Look around just people, can you hear their voice?
Find the one who'll guide you to the limits of your choice
But if you're in the eye of storm
Just think of the lonely dove
The experience of survival is the key
To the gravity of love

O fortuna, velut luna
