Take me back to the rivers of belief
Take me back to the rivers of belief
My friend
I look inside my heart
I look inside my soul
I promise you I will return
And when the lamb
Opened the seventh seal
Silence covered the sky
Take me back to the rivers of belief
Take me back to the rivers of belief
My friend
I look inside my heart, I look inside my soul
I'm reaching out for you, let's hope one day
We'll rest in peace on my rivers of belief
