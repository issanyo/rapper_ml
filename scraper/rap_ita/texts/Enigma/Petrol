[Verse 1]
I'm a masochist different taxes activist that's acting rich
Smack a bitch, dick her ass, and if she cracks I'll have to quit
I stayed in fact to blow up like I made an atom split
'cause when I rape a track the greatest rappers say they're bad at it
I made a pact to lay the savage shit you faggot haters lack
And praying that you'll maybe have some day to match a bit
But frankly, that's a ways from happening
'cause they's imagining they're catching up to me
While sucking, like "I blaze a track" and
The way they're rapping tends to make me laugh
And then I take a nap
And when I'm waking back, I'll take their neck and break in half it
I slay the wackest rhyming fakes who ain't learning
The time it takes to get murdered is faster than the time it takes to practice

[Verse 2]
I'm not a prophet but God and me talk and mourn another
'cause times are rough, but my son is gonna be born in rougher
The swarms of governors smile and say they'll change the nation
All the while stationed in place and waitin' for porn to buffer
Shit, this age of hate and rage and war has covered
Way before the days that sworn-in fakes became distorted bluffers
And blatant corner cutters, aimed at taking more but stutter
Quaking say we point out what had fated all the poor to suffer
It's like the media's deceiving us
Treating us like we'd never see it, they don't believe in us
Leaving us in the breeze when we need 'em and be releasing just
Bits and pieces of history and see it like sweeping dust
Tryna selectively represent to the people what
Ethics and beliefs the executives said that we should trust
That's why the cops stay beating on teens
But I would fucking leave in cuffs 'fore I ever gave my people up
Now you could say that I'm crazy, maybe that's dece' enough
But it depletes your trust when the staties seem to be leaving us
We bleed and hustle with eyes mace has been burning clean
My face is turning green, copper badges always seem to rust
Get it?
But still I can't control the fire
I'm holding up the boulders and molding my own empire
I won't be a liar, I'm tired of those that actually have the audacity
To act like we never had the capacity to strike back
