Here's the mirror. (behind, there is a screen)
Turn around. (On both ways, you can get in)
The experience of survival

Look around just people
Can you hear their voice?
Find the one who'll guide you
To the limits of your choice
(The experience of survival)

Try to think about
That's the chance to live your life
And discover
Try to think about
The experience of survival
(The experience)
