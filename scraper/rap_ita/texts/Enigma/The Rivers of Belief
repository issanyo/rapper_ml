If you believe in light, it is because of its purity
If you believe in Joy it is because of sadness
And if you believe in god. It is because of the devil

Take me back, to the rivers of belief
Take me back, to the rivers of belief
My friend
I look inside my heart
I look inside my soul
I promise you
I will return

And when the Lamb opened the seventh seal
Silence covered the sky

Take me back, to the rivers of belief
Take me back, to the rivers of belief
My friend
I look inside my heart
I look inside my soul
I'm reaching out for you
Let's hope one day
We'll rest in peace
On my rivers of belief
