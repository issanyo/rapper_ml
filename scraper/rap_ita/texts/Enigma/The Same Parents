We all have the same parents
Many million years ago
Why can't we live in freedom
Without hunger; with no war?

At the beginning
We all had one mother and one father
That's where we descended from
I don't... I don't understand why
So much hate between races and religions
It's mad; insane
I don't understand

We all have the same parents
Many million years ago
Why can't we live in freedom
Without hunger; with no war?

I don't... I don't understand
Why so much hate
Embraces our religions

We all have the same parents
Many million years ago
Why can't we live in freedom
Without hunger; with no war?

At the beginning
We all had one mother and one father
That's where we descended from

We all have the same parents
Many million years ago
Why can't we live in freedom
Without hunger; with no war?

I don't... I don't understand
Why so much guilt
Between races and religions

I don't... I don't understand

(I don't... I don't understand
I don't... I don't understand)

(We all had the same parents, many million years ago...)
