I promise you... for all my life
I'll be always by your side
In the shadow, in the light

I'll follow you... wherever life goes
But I'll always be aside
In the shadow, in the light

If, we don't understand
Hell is happy, heaven, is, sad
And that's, the result of our... of our, of our brain
Insane

I promise you... for all my life
I'll be always by your side
In the shadow, in the light

I'll be always bn your side
In the shadow, in the light

Caravan of life
By day and by night
Every tile's, a part of life
Is it shadow or light?

I promise you... for all my life
I'll be always by your side
In the shadow, in the light

But I'll always be aside
In the shadow, is the light

In the shadow, is the light
In the shadow, is the light

I promise you, I promise you
I promise you, in the shadow is the light

In the shadow is the light
