[Intro]
We ride, we ride 22's or better
We, we ride, we ride 22's or better
{I swang on 'em, swang on 'em}
{I swang on 'em, swang on 'em}
Now if I catch you at the light {I swang on 'em, swang on 'em}
That candy paint ain't lookin right {I swang on 'em, swang on 'em}
We ride, we ride 22's or better {Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em}
We, we ride, we ride 22's or better {Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em}

[Bun B]
Now if you come down to this Dirty South, betta watch yo' ears
Cause country boys talk with a dirty mouth, and they on them corners
And they hustlin up that dirty D, betta watch them dirty boys
Down South we keep it dirty G, I know you heard of me
I got that work (work) man I got that white and I got that purp', and I
Got that brown and I got that green when I'm in yo' town and I hit yo' scene
In a candy painted car that'll sit so clean
Trunk on pop with the fifth on lean
"II Trill" DVD playin on my screen
Sittin on cream, man you know what I mean?

[Hook]
Now if I catch you at the light {I swang on 'em, swang on 'em}
That candy paint ain't lookin right {I swang on 'em, swang on 'em}
We ride, we ride 22's or better {Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em}
We, we ride, we ride 22's or better {Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em}

[Bun B]
Now if you come down to this T-E-X, betta show some love
Cause homey you don't wanna see me plex, when we 'bout that paper
And ain't no shortstop in my cashin checks, I get full of ana
And get to standin upon these niggas necks, betta show respect
Or we pullin out them tecs, man I got them macs and I got them K's
And I got them 9's and I got them A's, R-15's and them two-two-treys
Player when I ride I'mma ride for days, no I don't miss and I sho' don't graze
Bring what you got and I bet it don't faze
I'm a trill-ass nigga man it's in my ways

[Hook]

[Lupe Fiasco]
Yup! Now I'm Chi-Town born and I'm Chi-Town bred; call me Westside Lu'
But I know about the Northside blues and them Southside reds
I run the F-N-F crew 'til my man Chilly Chill come home and he back on deck
My garage keep a very fast car, keep a classy gold chain wrapped around my neck
I came from the left but I'm downright fresh
Speak on - how you on a song Bun B on
Complete 180 how crazy has he gone
How strong is the brand of D that he on?
How come he do what he want and never do what we want?
I'm Rick James, and this game
Is a white leather couch for me to plant my feet on
The Murphys didn't jump me, told me to get comfy
Even brought the loveseat for me to spill my drink on
Willie D gave me my stamp
Shout to Mike Jones and the Swisha camp
That boy Kyleon and the Rap-A-Lot Ranch
The "boss of the North" and "The People's Champ"
Coolest nigga what? Coolest nigga what?
Been swallowed by them city lights
Ball 'til I'm benched and I put it on a pimp
F-N-F, U-P, U-G-K fo' life

[Hook]
