Long ago, for many years
White men came in the name of GOD
They took their land, they took their lives
A new age has just begun

They lost thier GODS, they lost their smile
They cried for help for the last time
Liberty was turning into chains
But all the white men said
That's the cross of changes

In the name of GOD - The fight for gold
These were the changes
Tell me - is it right - In the name of GOD
These kind of changes?

They tried to fight for liberty
Without a chance in hell, they gave up
White men won in the name of GOD
With the cross as alibi

There's no GOD who ever tried
To change the world in this way
But for the ones who abuse his name
There'll be no chance to escape
On judgement day

In the name of GOD - The fight for gold
These were the changes
Tell me - is it right - In the name of GOD
These kind of changes?

Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
The white men said:
That's the cross of changes?
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
In the name of GOD
These kind of changes
