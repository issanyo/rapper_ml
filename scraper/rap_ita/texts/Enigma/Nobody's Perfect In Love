[Verse 1]
Sometimes I love this vibe more than I love a spliff
No point saying I'm lying, they be tryna catch me out n' shit
They all look the same bruh, come on take a pic
Only three different poses I bet, watch em take a pic
I think about what we really complain about
She'll toss some ass as fast as we toss her name around
Wonder how this came about, you met her at the homie's
Sexy physique, plus she a freak, but you won't see that she lonely
Triple x text back, her translation probably say hold me
But she a real bitch externally, feeling internally phoney
My niggas told me get this money, leave these females alone
Double x made shelter, but I can't give 'em a home
Can't call them all bitches bruh, sure feed 'em the bone
And if she cool enough, she'll probably lose the label that says clone, maybe
So many of us having babies, it's crazy
May hate me if I answer the question that, asks
