Turn around, have faith in all the changes
Turn around and you will feel
No more age of loneliness, you are a part of me
Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life is like a roundabout, a kind of LSD
Turn around, have faith in all the changes
Turn around and you will feel
No more age of loneliness, you are a part of me

Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life is like a roundabout, a kind of LSD
Turn around, have faith in all the changes
Turn around and you will feel
No more age of loneliness, you are a part of me
