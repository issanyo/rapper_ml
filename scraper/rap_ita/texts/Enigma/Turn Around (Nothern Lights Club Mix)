Good evening
This is the voice of Enigma
Feel your body
Start to move slowly
Let the rythm be your guiding light
Feel your body
Start to move slowly
Start to move slowly
Very slowly
The Screen Behind The Mirror, The Voice and the Snake
Principles of Lust, The Eyes of Truth, TNT for the Brain
Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life, like a real way out, a kind of LSD
Turn around, you're feeling all the changes
Turn around and you will feel
You'll reach your holiness
You are a part of me
Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life, like a real way out, a kind of LSD
Turn around, you're feeling all the changes
Turn around and you will feel
You'll reach your holiness
You are a part of me
Let the rythm be your guiding light
Let the rythm be your guiding light
Let the rythm be your guiding light
Let the rythm be your guiding light
Be your guiding light
