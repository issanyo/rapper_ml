It's hard to find the balance, when you are in love
You're lost in the middle, cause you have to decide
Between mind and heart

Heart is the engine of your body
But brain is the engine of life

Between mind and heart

Heart is the engine of your body
But brain is the engine of life

Between mind and heart
Between mind and heart

Between mind and heart
