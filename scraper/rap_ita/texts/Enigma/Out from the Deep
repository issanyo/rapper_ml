We came out from the deep
To learn to love, learn how to live
We came out from the deep
To avoid the mistakes we made

That's why we are here!
That's why we are here!
That's why we are here!

We came out from the deep
To help and understand, but not to kill
It takes many lives till we succeed
To clear the debts of many hundred years

That's why we are here!
That's why we are here!
That's why we are here!

That's why we are here!
That's why we are here!
That's why we are here!
