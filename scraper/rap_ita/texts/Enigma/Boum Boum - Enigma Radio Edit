My heart goes Boum Boum Boum
Every time I think of you
Inside It’s Boum Boum Boum
Lost control what shall I do
Cos I wanna be your lover
Till the end of our lives
I could never miss again
These loving eyes
Oh Boum Boum Boum
My heart goes Boum Boum Boum
Every time I think of you
I feel that Boum Boum Boum
No control of what I’ll do
Simplicity complexity oh what a tragedy
Reality insanity strange normality
Incredible untouchable Oh but just visual
And I want you Just you
Oh Boum Boum Boum
My heart goes Boum Boum Boum
When my mind is touching you
I’m going Boum Boum Boum
Only light inside my gloom
Cos I wanna be your lover
Till the end of our lives
I could never miss again
These loving eyes
Oh Boum Boum Boum
