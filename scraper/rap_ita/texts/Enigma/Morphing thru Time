"Earth... A biosphere... A complex, subtly balanced life-support system..."

Et turtur nidum
Ubi reponat pullos suos
Altaria tua Domine virtutum
Rex meus, et Deus meus

We are floating over the line
Let us follow our mind
All of our life we'll wait for the answer
And the question is why

If we're following our mind
We can glide into light
No one knows if there'll be an answer
While we're morphing thru time

We are floating over the line
Let us follow our mind
All of our life we'll wait for the answer
And the question is why

(We're just travellers
In endless space)

If we're following our mind
We can glide into light
No one knows if there'll be an answer
While we're morphing thru time
