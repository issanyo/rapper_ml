Hello and welcome
At your own risk
You're always welcome
Without guarantee

If you're so brave, then face the tide
There's no mercy in this life
Now it's time to feel and see
What is fiction and what's reality

Hello and welcome
Just look at me
Think about your future
But still try to lead

Too much confidence in what you have
Bad idea to feel too safe
Overload your destiny
And you'll wake up behind me

Hello and welcome (Welcome, welcome)

It's your own risk
You're always welcome (Welcome)
To enjoy reality

Hello, hello, hello and welcome
Just look at me
Think about your future
Still try to lead

Hello...hello
Just look at me
Just look at me
It's your destiny (Welcome)

Hello, hello...hello, hello
Hello, hello...hello, hello
Hello, hello...hello, hello
Hello, hello...hello, hello
Hello, hello...hello, hello
