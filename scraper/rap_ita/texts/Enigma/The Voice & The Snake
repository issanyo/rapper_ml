The first bowl on the earth
The second bowl on the sea
The third bowl on the rivers
The fourth bowl on the sun
The fifth bowl on the Beast
The sixth bowl on the stars
The seventh bowl on the air
And the earth turned grey
Sea turned black
The rivers turned red
The sun turned cold
The Beast turned pale
The stars turned fast
The air turned to poison
