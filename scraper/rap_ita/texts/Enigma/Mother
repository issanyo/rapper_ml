Don´t be shy
I know you need a place to hide
Mom is here and that´s all right
I´m on your side, on your side

It´s time you cross the river to glory land
Any dream helps survive
When you’are there, you will see
That´s the place you long to be
Trust me, this ride is free

Open up the windows of your mind
Don´t you see it is time
To leave your fears behind?

Come, follow me
Escape through word
Of desire and dreams
… desire and dreams
