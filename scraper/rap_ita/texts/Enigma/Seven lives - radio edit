Traces, many faces
Lost in the maze of time
Blinded by the darkness
That's the start of the seven lives
It's too close, but still too far
Follow your inner guide
Show us who you are (are, are)
In these seven lives
(Take it easy - [x3])
Follow your inner guide
Show me who you are
In these seven lives
It's too close, but still too far
Show me who you are
In these seven lives
