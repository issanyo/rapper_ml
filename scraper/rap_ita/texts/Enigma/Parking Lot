[Hook]
Don't get it right down, man this shit too hot
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
If you do it in here security gon' stop
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
All the folks in here gon' know who shot
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)

[Verse 1]
I came to bring doom and leave nasty wounds
Leave you maricons soakin', chokin in a bloody pool
Cause I don't shoot at clouds, I shoot at crowds
When you hear the BLAY! bitch, you better duck down
Layin' still with the cross and the scope on yo head
Squeeze the trigger, blow yo brains over there on yo bitch leg
Trigger-happy ain't the word, bitch I'm trigger-sprung
I'mma make you give a blowjob to my gun
Come on, come all, whoever wanna brawl
When I pull this yawk out my draws, hoe you gonna fall
And I plan on hittin' me a motherfuckin' organ
You screamin', blood is motherfuckin' pourin'
Ain't no pity in my goddamn city
Niggas are dirty, grimy, gritty
Keep playin' cock-a-roach, I play pesticide
Double bucks make you wear a shit bag all yo life

[Hook]
Don't get it right down, man this shit too hot
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
If you do it in here security gon' stop
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
All the folks in here gon' know who shot
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)

[Verse 2]
To all you weak-ass rappers who think you got issues
I got (?) and they ready to (?) you
So tell yo mammy bring plenty of tissue
I got a black dress and a coffin to fit you
Oh yes, Scarecrow gonna get up with you
I got a arsenal and I'm launchin' missiles
I torture you, beat you, leave you crippled
Smack you with the .40 and it's plated with nickel
Ain't nobody straight, ain't nobody safe
Be somewhere hid, dawg, lost without a trace
Bounce around the club, yeah he think he alright
But he won't be makin' it home tonight
You don't have to like me, I don't like you either
But slip up and you will see: I'm off the meter
And when you hear the BLAY!, like "damn who shot?"
Somebody just got popped in the parking lot

[Hook]
Don't get it right down, man this shit too hot
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
If you do it in here security gon' stop
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
All the folks in here gon' know who shot
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)

[Verse 3]
I made me a list, I'm checkin' it twice
Those who are naughty gettin' mortuary ice
Bitch ducked first, when the gun fire disperse
Bloody up yo shirt, put you in a Cadi hearse
Got somethin' outside that'll cut you in half
Go to yo mammy house, shove a pine cone up her ass
If you cross me I got somethin' special in store
Drive you down-town, throw you off the highest floor
Cause you know the Scarecrow, I'm down for some crucifixion
Dynamite up your ass, that's stimulation
You don't know the C4 is under your car
Cut that bitch up and throw yo punk-ass to mars
Don't get too close, bitch I cut yo throat
Send yo punk-ass to hell with the rest of my foes
Oh I just might wait 'til I think you forgot
And pop yo bitch-ass in the parking lot

[Hook]
Don't get it right down, man this shit too hot
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
If you do it in here security gon' stop
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
All the folks in here gon' know who shot
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
(Just pop his bitch-ass in the parking lot)
