Life is a wheel of changes
But changes are life
And someday we will have to say goodbye
But our spirit will survive

Love is phasing, love is moving
To the rhythm of your sight
In the darkness I get closer
To the crossing point of light

(Reason is lasting)
(passion is living)
(And dying is teaching us)
(How to live)
