Smell your skin
Feel your breath
You on my side
I couldn't resist

I hope I'll understand someday
What's the meaning of this crazy game
It is real and pure
TNT for the brain

If there's no pain
Rules are still the same
I'm with you, just lead me
I'm ready to play

(TNT for the brain)

(Don't be scared, and have no fear)
(I will show you what it means)

If there's no pain
Rules are still the same
I'm with you, just lead me
I'm ready to play

(TNT for the brain)

(Don't be scared, and have no fear)
(I will show you what it means)

If there's no pain
Rules are still the same
I'm with you, just lead me
I'm ready to play

(TNT for the brain)

(What you feel isn't insane)
(It is love and not a game)

If there's no pain
Rules are still the same
I'm with you, just lead me
I'm ready to play

(TNT for the brain)
