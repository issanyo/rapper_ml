Good evening
This is the voice, of Enigma
Feel your body
Start to move slowly
Let the rhythm, be your guiding light

Let the rhythm, be your guiding light

Turn, turn, turn around
Turn, turn, turn around
Turn, turn, turn around

Feel your body
Start to move slowly
Start to move slowly
Very slowly

The screen behind the mirror
The voice, and the snake
Principles of lust
The eyes of truth
T.N.T. for the brain

Turn around and i will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life is a roundabout
A kind of LSD
Turn around have faith in all the changes
Turn around and you will feel
No age of loneliness
You are a part of me

Turn around and i will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life is a roundabout
A kind of LSD
Turn around have faith in all the changes
Turn around and you will feel
No age of loneliness
You are a part of me

Let the rhythm, be your guiding light
Let the rhythm, be your guiding light
Let the rhythm, be your guiding light
Let the rhythm, be your guiding light
Be your guiding light
