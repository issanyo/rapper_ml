The hidden flaw of man is his insatiable desire to dominate though he can only feel complete when everybody sees what he sees

From this dependence, mankind gains weakness; sickening from a lack of progress
It feeds off the instability of the weaker through manipulation, fears and lies
The collective abide

What one man accomplishes alone becomes envy of the frail
The feeble aim to deprive him of this ambition
It is this insubordination of the individual that agitates society's strive for the preservation of its normalcy
As if it lingered

The herd casts a veil that everyone is all one in the same, but this could never be further from the truth
It is this myth that the weaker grasps in desperation to justify the denial of profit

The depth of humanity's adversity entrenches beyond abysmal scales when it grasps on mirages of promises
Society falls while the collective dances to the waltz in synchronized formation; tethered to chains welded with lies

“Ladies and gentlemen! Boys and girls! Step right up! We welcome you this glorious evening to witness the degradation of our fellow man
Seven billion performers will show you what you won't see elsewhere! I bring to you, the human sheep!”
