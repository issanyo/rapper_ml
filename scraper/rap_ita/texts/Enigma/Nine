[Intro: Versa]
As I wake in the cascade of symphonies
Euphony is all I hear
They await my arrival

So deep into that darkness peering
Long I stood there wondering, fearing, doubting
Dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before

I believe that every person has a talent
Many of us don't know that they exist, that we exist
Because we fear rejection, we fear not being good enough
Not being known so we slumber in the shadows
But time does not wait for any soul, lost or found

So rise from the depths of darkness
Let your voice be known
Discover yourself and that way people will discover you

This is it, this is where it begins
One life of numbers until we fall

I am Nine
