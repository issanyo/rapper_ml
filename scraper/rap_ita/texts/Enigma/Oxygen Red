Dare to be free and do
What’s right for you
Let it be. Don’t cry
And start anew
It’s your life!

Don’t you see?
You are free
To decide it’s life or death
Dry your eyes
You must fight
Or you breathe oxygen red

Take a stand
Raise your hand
Break the silence
Without love, without hope
You won’t survive

Don’t be shy
Don’t comply
Be deanced
Done for pray
Break away
And say “No”!

Dare to be free and do
What’s right for you
Let it be. Don’t cry
And start anew
It’s your life!
