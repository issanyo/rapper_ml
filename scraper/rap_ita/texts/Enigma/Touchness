[indistinct whisper]

(Touch and kiss me)
Up and down

(Touch and feel me)
Up and down

Touch and kiss me
Up and down

Touch and feel me
Up and down

Touch and kiss me...

[heavy breathing]

Oh, I'll always love you

Touch and kiss me
Up and down

Touch and feel me
Up and down

Touch and kiss me
Touch and feel me...

Touch and kiss me
Up and down

Touch and kiss me...

Touch and feel me...
