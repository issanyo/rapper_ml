Miles away from light at noon
Total eclipse of the moon
Many reasons to believe in life
Just listen what it's telling you

Come, have a look inside
Total eclipse of the moon
Don't be childish and don't be so cruel
I'm feeling just lonely without.... without you

I can see the wide horizons
But debts, to be paid
Our ways, will cross again, someday
Believe and come back to you.... may see you soon

Time doesn't say hello
Total eclipse of the moon
Many nights in our lives before
Dreaming to be just beside.... beside you

Total eclipse of the moon
I'll see you soon
