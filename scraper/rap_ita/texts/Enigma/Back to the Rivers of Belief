Take me back to the rivers of belief
Take me back to the rivers of belief, my friend
I look inside my heart, I look inside my soul
I promise you, I will return
And when the lamb opened the seventh seal
Silence covered the sky
Take me back to the rivers of belief
Take me back to the rivers of belief, my friend
I look inside my heart, I look inside my soul
I'm reaching out for you
Lets hope one day, we'll rest in peace
On my rivers of belief
