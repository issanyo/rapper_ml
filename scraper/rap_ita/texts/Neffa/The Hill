I've been playing with devil
And he made me cry
All alone in the distance
In the darkest night

I've been calling for an angel
And he made me fly
Spred my wings took the highway
To the wide blue sky

There's a hill on an island
And a story to tell
A tale of witches and pirates
And a magic spell

By the light of a candle
I can see the two seas
And I feel I belong here
Finally released

I've been playing with devil
I've been calling for an angel
There's a hill on an island
