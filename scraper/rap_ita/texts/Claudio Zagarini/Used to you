[Verse 1]
Flickin' my hair
I don't care
'Cause I'm making bank
Made it all on my own
I don't give a damn, no
I don't give a damn, no

I need you to just want me
For who I am
Tell me now if you think
You could be that man
You, you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on baby won't you tell me what you're waiting for?
Give me something just so l know what I'm fighting for
Come on baby won't you tell me what you're waiting for?
What you waiting for?

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you to love me
Just want you to love me
Just tell me you want me
Oh you
Won't you tell me you love me?
Won't you tell me you love me?
Won't you tell me you want me?

[Verse 2]
Just myself
Never had it any other way
Now you make my heart wanna runaway
True, oh it's true

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on baby won't you tell me what you are waiting for?
Give me something just so I know what l'm fighting for
Come on baby won't you tell me what you are fighting for?
What you waiting for?

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you to love me
Just want you to love me
Just tell me you want me
Oh you
Won't you tell me you love me?
Won't you tell me you love me?
Won't you tell me you want me?

[Bridge]
I could get used to you
I could get used to you
I could get used to you
I could get used to you
I could get used to you
I could get used to you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
