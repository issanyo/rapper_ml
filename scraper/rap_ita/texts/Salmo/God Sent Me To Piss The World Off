Your name is like dyin in my sleep, I don't feel it
You don't survive

You want what I've got
Belevie me I'm psyco
Fuck you don't buy me with gold

I hate your radio, your tv, your heroes
You are the real crimal, you criminal, you criminal
I hate your radio, your tv, your heroes
You are the real crimal, you criminal, you criminal

When I get dusted
I like to spread the blood
When I get dusted
Destroy you, asshole

I'm not for sale
I want be your slave for what is worth
It is worth all the while
I'm not for sale
I want be your slave
For what is worth
It is worth all the while

I hate your radio, your tv, your heroes
You are the real crimal, you criminal, you criminal

Radio won't even play this song, this hate
Radio won't even play this song, this hate


I'm not for sale
