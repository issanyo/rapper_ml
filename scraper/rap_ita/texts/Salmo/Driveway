[Strofa: Gig Young & James Dean]

Speaking of racing, have you ever been in a drag race?
What are you kidding me?
I just tought I'd ask. No, Jim races in the tradition, you might say. Real racing cars, real tracks. How fast will your car go?
Ohâ€¦ in honest miles an hour, clocked 160/170
You've won a few races, haven't you?
Oh, one or two
Where?
I showed pretty good at Palm Springs. I ran at Bakersfield
Jimmy, we probably have a great many young people watching our show tonight and, for their benefit, I'd like your opinion about fast driving on the highway. Do you think it's a good idea?
Good point
I used to fly around quite a bit, I took a lot of unnecessary chances on the highways. And I started racing and now, I drive on the highways and I'm, uh, extra cautious. 'Cause no one knows what they're doing half the time. You don't know what this guy's going to do or that one. On the track, there a lot of men who spend a lot of time in developing rules, ways of safety. And, uh, I find myself being very cautious on the Highway. I don't have the urge to speed on the Highway. People say racing is dangerous, but I'll take my chances on the track any day than on the Highway
Alright, Gig. I better take off
Wait Jimmy, one more question. Do you have any special advice for the young people who drive?
Take it easy driving. The life you save might be mine
