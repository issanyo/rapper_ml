Yup
Yup
Uh

See the picture painted
I made it without a paint brush
Check the art buffs rush to my art stuff, Class
Hear the sights if ya can't see the sounds
Last runner through the motion puts one ear on the ground, its
Year one now, calendar can't be found
Leap years are probably easier chillin in denial
Fake it till you make doesn't seem so profound
So my touch is good enough
We all came from galaxy dust
Yup
Welcome home much love y'all
I got the remedy to bounce back like medicine ball
I'm professional
I ain't hoopin with a tennis ball
Ever since I saw
The vision to uplift like seesaw
Had to make ideas fat like a bear claw
My law
Great minds don't pay attention to jabber jaw
And say you well I didn't know it
Real never proclaims what's real, they just know it
Scroll poet, so heroic
Ancestors gave advice to a Moses and Noah
Grown lotus, focus on your dreams
You can rise from the lowest
Muddy waters ever seen
Knowledge doses if you please
Chakras open, brighter than my future sees
We're all one never fear a thing
Overcome the negatives as a human being
Mufasa had to die for Simba to succeed, so
What's a few Scars to self proclaimed King

...

Planets and the stars can't ignore their existence
Just look up and smoke up and bask in the ambience
Ray Kurzweil, Transcendence
Feeling ill?
3d print yourself a new enhancement
Weed cures cancer, fuck the chemo
Doctors getting paid saw that natural is evil, so
Wake up people
Start to think before it's illegal
Get real, turn me up some
And always stay peaceful
I'm home
