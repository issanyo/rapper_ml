[Verse 1]
There is a monster that breathes inside of me
I can feel its heart beating but it's out of sync
I hold my breath; its lungs fill up
I exhale and its eyes come on
What does it want? What does it need?
How will I know if my blood is real?
Am I a man in a world surreal?
Am I a man in a world that's real?

[Chorus]
We're breaking through to the other side
We're gonna take you all along for the ride
Get on board, let's leave this place behind
We're not afraid anymore
The voices, we don't need them at all
We all know the score, we've seen it all before

[Post-Chorus]
What you got to say now that I control you
I'm in your head now, what you're gonna do?
What you got to say now that I control you
I'm in your head now, what you're gonna do?

[Build-Up]
Real eyes realize the real lies
God damn, Machine Head were right!
Real eyes do realize the real lies
You can't hide now, you're in plain sight!

[Drop]
Real eyes realize the real lies
God damn, Machine Head were right!
Real eyes do realize the real lies
You can't hide now, you're in plain sight!
Am I a man in a world surreal?
Am I a man in a world that's real?
There are signals that can open doors
The same visions

[Verse 2]
There is a monster that has taken over me
It's got no heart but it has a beat
It follows rules and all the codes that don't exist
It just lives, it just lives, it just lives
And I don't have another question
Because my mind, it's not mine anymore
I repeat everything I'm told
And I can feel it as it all unfolds

[Pre-Chorus]
What you got to say now that I control you
I'm in your head now, what you're gonna do?
What you got to say now that I control you
I'm in your head now, what you're gonna do?

[Chorus]
We're breaking through to the other side
We're gonna take you all along for the ride
Get on board, let's leave this place behind
We're not afraid anymore
The voices, we don't need them at all
We all know the score, we've seen it all before

[Build-Up]
Real eyes realize the real lies
God damn, Machine Head were right!
Real eyes do realize the real lies
You can't hide now, you're in plain sight!

[Drop]
Real eyes realize the real lies
God damn, Machine Head were right!
Real eyes do realize the real lies
You can't hide now, you're in plain sight!
Am I a man in a world surreal?
Am I a man in a world that's real?
There are signals that can open doors
The same visions

[Outro]
We're breaking through to the other side
(Break to the other side, leave this place behind)
