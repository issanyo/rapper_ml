[Hook]
Why you want to be with me?
If you always tell me lies
If you not here when i cry
If you not care if i die

[Verse 1]
Tell me, ¨hey, i care about you¨
I just want that you love me like i do
Fuck my friends, i just want you
Cause u make me feel so good
I don´t got no one to love
Everybody see me like a ghost
Going like crazy checkin at my phone
And you never text me, yeah i know

[Hook]
Why you want to be with me
If you always tell me lies
If you not here when i cry
If you not care if i die

[Chorus]
Im just trying to live so fast
Im 18 and i already wanna die
See my pain, you can see this on my eyes
Feel confussed, i dont know if im the right
Im just trying to live so fast
Im 18 and i already wanna die
See my pain you can see this on my eyes
Feel confussed, i dont know if im the right

[Hook]
Why you want to be with me
If you always tell me lies
If you not here when i cry
If you not care if i die

[Verse 1]
Tell me, ¨hey i care about you¨
I just want that you love me like i do
Fuck my friends, i just want you
Cause u make me feel so good
I dont got no one to love
Everybody see me like a ghost
Going like crazy checkin at my phone
And you never text me, yeah i know
Yeah, i know
Yeah, i know
