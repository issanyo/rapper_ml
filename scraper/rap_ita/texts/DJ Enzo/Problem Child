She was a problem child, misunderstood, never did any good
Always running wild, her lonely heart beat in the darkest of nights

And all she ever wanted was a home, she could call her own
And all she ever wanted was a home, to belong

To belong (3x)

She was a problem child, misunderstood, never did any good
Always running wild, her lonely heart beat in the darkest of nights

And all she ever wanted was a home, she could call her own
And all she ever wanted was a home, to belong

To belong (3x)
