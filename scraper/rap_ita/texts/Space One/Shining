[Verse 1]
Rising like the clouds
You got me so high up all night you're walking
Through my heart, did you know, oh
Maybe I called your name almost thousand times
You made me realize
So deepest something to desire
I would not admit what I already know
Take it slow sugar

[Chorus]
Woo, woo
Woo, woo, watch me shining
Woo, woo, yeah
Woo, woo, I get so scare now
Woo, woo
Kiss me on the neck
And then I’ll catch your eyes
Woo, woo you get this high
Dance on the neck
And then I’ll catch your eyes

[Verse 2]
Just get down to the beat
You must be lose control yeah
Keep your dancing
Keep your eyes on me
Hold me tight, babe
We are born to be together
We can bring it on the floor
When this song comes on
We need just one dance
That’s all I have to say

[Chorus]
Woo, woo
Woo, woo, watch me shining
Woo, woo, yeah
Woo, woo, I get so scare now
Woo, woo, kiss me on the neck
And then I’ll catch your eyes
Woo, woo, you get this high
Dance
Woo, woo
Woo, woo, watch me shining
Woo, woo, yeah
Woo, woo, I get so scare now
Woo, woo, kiss me on the neck
And then I’ll catch your eyes
Woo, woo, you get this high
Dance

[Outro]
On the neck and then I’ll catch your eyes
On the neck and then I’ll catch your eyes
Rising like the clouds
You got me so high
