[Verse 1]
Feels like unusual thing
How about that
If I'm right seems like we belong together
Who are we? I think
We may will be like Sid and Nancy
But now believe in me

[Chorus]
Your kiss like na, na, na
Your voice so drowsy, crazy and lovely
As I said before, we belong together

[Verse 2]
Love is like a moon dance
The moment when the moon shines
In the dark we set our steps together
When we stop nobody knows
Take us up above the clouds

[Chorus]
Your kiss like na, na, na
Your voice so drowsy, crazy and lovely
As I said before, we belong together
