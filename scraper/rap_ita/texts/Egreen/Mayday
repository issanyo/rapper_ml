[Verse 1]
All I do is spittin' and I ain't worried a bit
You little bitches thought I quit then you better just sit
I still got asses to kick
As many as the classes in high school I skipped
Egreen is a classic and it's basically it
Same place VA where it all started
I had a team but things changed can't do nothing about it
Thought it was my fault when things got bad
And through all the years all the time I wasted simply ruined my head
Like take it nice and catching your girl fucking your best friend
No use telling my self that it won't happen again
All I have to do is kill a beat like this
Not expecting y'all realize how deep this is
I mean, look at me I ain't got .9s
More likely catch me at the bar before paying and counting the dimes
So don't compare me to your favourite MC of the day
If you fly high with me, you are calling a mayday
Bitch!
