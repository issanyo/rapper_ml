[Bridge]
It's always been like that
We're just spitting fool
Who gives a fuck where you from
Just get in the booth
"Show and Prove" is the rule in my house
And we won't stop till this fucking scene's locked down
PRAOW (x2)

[Hook]
Well, here's something you can talk about
Fire in the hole
If you're asking what's this song about
Talk is cheap
Chatty boy, we don't fuck around
'cause when it comes to dropping bars, yeah, we all about (x2)

[Egreen]
Bitch, we too fresh, we spit toothpaste
Get this shit wether officially or bootleg
We don't mind as long as this is what your system plays
We do shows while all these other pussy rappers just complain
Old school like Wiley or Roots Manuva
We be ninjas on these tunes without Glocks or Rugers
Look mom, no hands!
I be riding sixteens like Meridian Dan
Cruising in that fuckin Benz
I'm not a G, I'm a bloody MC
I love money like you
But I don't fuck with wack beats
Nowadays that rapping seems like it's a fucking joke
And everybody hops on board like it's a fucking boat
I'm the one that tells you "Mate, get the fuck out!"
'cause everytime I touch a mic it's a touchdown
Milano-Manchester just putting this shit on the map
You can either snitch or love us, we remain a fact
