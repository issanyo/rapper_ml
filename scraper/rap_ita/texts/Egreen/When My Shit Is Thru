[Verse 1]
Even though I would mind just to fuck and sell
You'll never catch me up on TRL , I'm somewhere else
You know those other things
And it wasn't my fault when your door bell rang, yo
You must have done something stupid, you fuck
Like tellin' your slut how much shit you sell in the park
Cool, aight man, then we'll figure that out
Let's get back to the topic, I'll show you what I'm about
I'm about hip hop and it's not for kids
By know you be like "Who the fuck he thinks he is?"
Matter of fact, who the fuck you think I am?
Just another broke who's worth a hundred ??
A hundred mill, when I spit I shoot to kill
On stage I'm a beast I listen to Ill Bill
I'm on the white trash music you know
I'm on my grind but it's not for dough
Not for fame, not for props
All I really wanna do is spit till the motherfucking beat stops
Don't ask me, ask yourself what you doin' here
And go look for your girl cause she's in the rear
Me? I'm piss drunk and it's nothing new
I got a bottle in my hand and had a sip or two
I'm saying man, I know that you don't want me to
It's alright I'ma leave when my shit is through!
