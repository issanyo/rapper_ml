"Ya..ya..y'all know the name"
"I'm the king of the underground so act like you know me"

[Strofa 1]
I feel so cold at 26 years old
It’s been some time now tryina keep my profile low
All these new kids really really think they gon blow
After a five minutes of gig they have a sore throat
Guess what you pricks, I’mma be here
Stay laughing at your faces when you’ll call your quite
E-Green true last man standing
I’m on some hardcore rap shit no backstage bragging
Ya’ll think it’s a game, it’s not funny to me
I’m Lennox Lewis heavyweight spittin’ machine
They told me to  keep my mouth shut, respecting the gods
That’s why I shit on rappers, fuck money and brads
Ask yourself for a second what you’re doing this for
It gets deeper than music bitches dream on
It’s time to separate the real from the phony
The name is E-Green, punk act like you know me


[Rit. & Scratch]

Well now you know who you’re fuckin’ with


[Strofa 2]

I’ve done so much but it’s never enough
About what has been on my shit
Even when times got mad ruff
Now everybody wants to give me advice
When they don’t even know how to live their own fuckin’ life
The thing is I never really gave a fuck
‘cause when I needed it, no one gave me half a buck
Now we do what you could what you want
What you shoot, what you don't instead respect in your[?]
It’s all right ‘cause I’m used to this crap
No one ever does shit unless they get something back
Best friends go black ‘cause they don’t know how to act
And nowadays I’ve lost my patience man I can’t go through that
I’ve always paid my dues
Trust me, you ain’t ready to win if you never learned how to lose
And all I know at the end of the day
It’s what you do that remains rapper, not what you say

[Rit. & Scratch]

[Bridge]

This is for every time that I’ve been on my knees
Every fuckin time I’ve thought somebody help me please
Everyone who stands up on his own two feet
Every b-boy, writer, dj and mc
