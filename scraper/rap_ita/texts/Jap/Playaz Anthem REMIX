[Verse:1 Manny]

In The Middle of The Summer, Niggas balling like they wanna
Bitches talking how they gonna
The Homies blasting when the sun up
Im Tryna make it to the Top Nigga, If these niggas try to stop me they getting shot nigga
Im the best fucking out here, If these niggas disagree then they all queers
Fuck boys coming crazy, Ya'll balling Hard?
Hmmmmm, Bitch Maybe
I hit the bank, and drop a couple sticks
My young boy got caught and he ain't fucking snitch
Man my life is fucking crazy, from the hoes all way down to meeting Savvy
I look at my note pad and just think, Man my wrist got ice like the rink
That bar was tuff as shit dont you think
I couldve did better but I ain't write that
Broadday bouta come on, bitch fight back
Broadday bouta come on, bitch fight back

[Verse:2 Broadday Crutch]

All these bitches on my dick, Wifey blowing up my shit
Tahj 30, He hit my phone he said he got another lick
Ima hit Jap line cause I know he with shits, Zoe migos in this bitch
Haiti whipping up a brick
I gotta leave you quick but Ill be back around the 5th, If you loyal thats my pussy if you not than im gone dip
Sorry had to say this shit, But I put this on crip
All these bitches on my dick but I tell you not to trip, cuz they dont mean shit
You my wifey fuck these tricks
I be on the block daily, Always gripping that 380
I can't slip, No I can't slip, Cause if I slip than you gone dip
But dont ever think im whipped because I can always have a bitch

[Verse:3 Tahj30]

All these hoes on my dick, I dont give a shit
I dont pay these bitches mind, Im just tryna keep my grind
On this Playaz Anthem flow, Bitches come and go, im just tryna stack my dough
All this Bali ima blow, all my niggas with the shits
Squad shit, We with the shits, get this pack and ima flip
Keep that tool up on me gripped, hoes always think they slick
Hugged up takin flicks, Smack a bitch I give no shit, im jus tryna get rich
Never trust a bitch, theyll put you in some shit
Man just worry bout ya money, all these bitches act funny, But you needa ride or die and I got her by my side
Whenever she hit my line, We could always spend time
But I never miss my grind, Money stay on my mind

[Verse:4 Jap]

These Bitches hit my line, Talkin like I dont spend time
But ima young nigga grinding, Its nothing but money on my mind
Don't even waste ya time, Don't even waste breathe ya bitches talk to me to death
Ya ain't getting no fucking check
Like my name was Hugh Heff, I get the pussy then I jet
Don't want no fucking feelings Im just beating up the flesh
Cuz the money treat me the best, The whole hood throwin thumbs so don't disrespect the set
None of my niggas ball, But ya niggas know we got the tech
So don't get yo ass wacked, While you flipping that pack
Fuck boy, You don't want that
Leave his brains in his snap back
I ain't mean to come reckless, but real niggas will respect this
Im getting bread while you pillow talking my ex bitch
Ya'll niggas a damm trip, Cuz I ain't never worried about a trick
Cuz my money is my main bitch, Yeah, my money is my main bitch
All my niggas like that, We Gorgeous Borough made bitch!
