[Verse 1]
Yeah
Okay, sipping on kiwi
Chilling, watching T.V
Trying to figure out who in the world could ever beat me
Not even your sweetest dream would ever be so nice to you
Have me thinking silly things like me giving the mic to you
I'm Mike to you Kobe Bryant/Lebron James wannabes
And I'm the man that your kids' kids are gonna see
Introducing the young Lucifer producing using stupid loops on Fruity Loops
And make 'em sound, cool
Sort of like this one
Duh duh duh, duh duh duh, duh duh duh, da da
Oooooh

[Hook]
Started out tryna sell a mixtape (mixtape)
Now I'm getting show money e'yday (e'yday)
Tryna be the Little Boy Bo Peep, but no sheep cause I'm waking up with no sleep
(No sleep)
Yeah, yeah, waking up with no sleep
(No sleep)
Yeah, yeah, waking up with no sleep
(No sleep)
Tryna be the Little Boy Bo Peep, but no sheep cause I'm waking up with no sleep

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, and this is where I'm digging deep
Even at the latest hours you will never find me asleep
Tried to make my music stand out, true colors speak
Tried to be played on the radio about a (BLEEP)
Y'all sleeping while my whole team's staying wide awake
Grinding every night, never waste a day to take a break
This isn't a mixtape, this is my story and
If you think you know it, then go 'head tell it for me
Ha, more bags on my face than a grocery
You beating me? Uh, no sirree
Can I get a witness in this business?
This is nothing but the truth
Bring my brothers to the top, try to lead the (?) youth
Man, when I wrote this song
I really didn't know until I (?) this song
Which flow, I dunno, fast/slow
But I know it don't belong
That's you and your crew, so don't come around and
Ask for it with no cash for it
Try to take it from me, I'll spaz on you
Doing it with ease, never see me thinking z's, street dreamz

[Hook]

You don't know nothing 'bout this, (nope) not at all
I'm wide awake and y'all tripping off the Tylenol
You don't know nothing 'bout this, nah, not at all, nah nah not at all
Nah nah not at all

You don't know nothing 'bout this, not at all

[Hook]
