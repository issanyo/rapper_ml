[Verse 1]
Yeah, uh, ha, check, Ja
Hello world, good morning ladies
Good evening greatness, goodnight haters
Malcolm X specs, what you expect?
Snapback, match that, Air Max
Never see me in the Foamposite
You sucker rappers is blow-popping
I'm show stopping, yeah I flow cocky
But nobody could ever stop me
You understand or oversit?
My money's in bundles of sticks, more fags than a closed closet
Whether the studio or show, just know I'm gon' rock it
Blast us off, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, blast off, I'm in a rocket
Good L.O.O.K. Gang, boy put your pinkies up
Good L.O.O.K., baby, never stinky butts
But, we ishing all over your toilet seats
The mic, pencil, and paper are my toiletries
I got the freshest flow, I got the hottest beats
And everywhere I go, they be telling me

[Hook]
Telling me to get down, and all I can do is climb
And even though I dream (?) I got a whole lot on my mind
Stay up, stay up
They tell me to get down, I tell 'em to stay up, stay up

[Verse 2]
Whattup, check
I understand when I overstand you you can't stand it
But I am not on this earth, I'm on my own planet
Ja-Pluto, you know who go the hardest on the ignorant instrumental
Break leg and (?) on stage like the mechanical pencils
No pens in this business
Holla at the women on your friends list
Tell 'em all that I don't give a Cheez-It
If you got a man or not
I like to hater hop, he look like he on my jock
He got every song I drop
"Yeah man I uh got the uh Undiscoverd uh Sumtin' Slite uh I got..."
Oh, heck no
Hello, wake up cause this is no longer a fantasy
You want me to go to sleep, while I stay up

[Hook]
