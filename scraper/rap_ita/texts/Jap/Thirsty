[Intro]
Thirsty
Thirsty

[Hook]
Hit me up on the early, damn they so thirsty
Name all up in they mouth, bruh but I bet that y'all never heard of me
Bet that y'all never heard of me, bet that y'all never heard of me
Name all up in they mouth, bruh damn they so thirsty

[Verse 1: Mitri Corleone]
You know me, Mitri
Last name'd be Frazier
Your girl wanna play on my team and I ain't even coaching for the damn Lakers
She trying out in my private (?), cause I wasn't even really tryna diss her
She asked for some more sessions but I shipped her off like Fisher
It ain't my fault, that's how it be
I'm an animal, you can't tame me
Wanna take me, wanna cage me
Wanna go platinum, (?) me
Well that's dead, that's not my plan
I'm my own man, not a soda can
So if you feelin' dehydrated, better grab your cell and get a hold of your man
Cause all I need is this Stussy and some Js with some loose strings
You can fake it in front of your girl just remember who made you sing
Young bull, Mitri pimping
Got that flame, no burger flipping
My style, cats bite
And my steez, girls sipping

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ja-P]
Yeah, ha, hey, Lehbump, zoom
Ja-P in space
Get more top than a pizza place
Getting your girl is a piece of cake
Get a plate, say your grace, you can have a taste
Riding around on that interstate
Flying around with them (?)
Girls 'round here don't need the face
I'm coming too if you need a replacement
Studio in my mom's basement
Time was given, no time was wasted
Tryna get up on that (?), and then get a Vicodin
YouTube video hero, stop tryna steal my style
Don't matter what you do, you still lose, Pacquiao
Sitting in my cubicle, sipping a little Pinnacle
Chilling when I be getting the women (?) in swimming pools
Uh, and I'm fiending to win and whenever you ready I'm racing with the baton
Who I give it to?
Not you cause you not true
Tryna be a follower, be a leader bruh
Get a liter, (?) getting rid of your thirst get a sippy cup

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T-Flow]
I don't really rap I like to fuck around
Cause I be smoking strong, y'all niggas Charlie Brown
And that smoke is loud when you riding with me
T-Flow, you know I'm smoking that tree
(?) I keep around me for the simple fact that I be going in
These niggas talk but I don't hear the shit because my money's longer
Are you feeling it?
Real talk my nigga, can you do it?
Hit the beats, looking like Ray Lewis
Cross the line, see your life
Uh, flash real quick right in front of your eyes
I'm not a killer, but don't push me
Fistpumping, don't call me Snooki
Riding round with my nigga Ja, tryna put in work because a nigga thirsty
I experience life for all it has to offer
Doing all my deaths before I hit the coffin
I started running when y'all started walking
So I hit the bong and I started coughing

[Hook]
