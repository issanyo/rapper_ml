[Intro: Ja-P]
Ja, I feel good man
Ha, nah I ain't singing on this track, boy
Yeah, turn me up, legoooo!

[Verse: Ja-P]
Youngest in the game, you can call me Ja-Prentice
Flow Steve Nash, don't need no assistance
Never been sentenced, still need a witness
Running this game in addition to my fitness
I am me, O-O-V-O-O
Playing this game, got no more cheat codes
I ball, I don't need practice
I'm the best, hands down, like a class full of black kids
No racism, white whip, black rims
E-mail flow, like please get at him
Dot com, listen to my intellect, mind holds roads and my flow's about to intersect
Buggin' out and you lookin' like an insect
I'm gonna have to inspect everything that we said
Getting to the fame, realizing economy
Continuing the reign and advising for you to follow me
Dude, we come in calories, carrying the burner
My flow'll have you wishing you was Timmy Turner
Jorgen von Stranglin' the beat 'til it dies
And my 20/20 vision ain't sitting in the eyes
If you got pride, let's get it in together
Cut loose, never that, I'm gonna live forever
Got me, Ja-P, spittin' all over it
No (?) flow and don't you ever try to get over it, and
If you think you got game: get more of it
I got game, top shelf, get over it
But nobody's getting over me
Honor-roll swag, boy I get my clothes overseas
Get it, and if you didn't then rewind a few
Flow is like a bad child sitting right behind the pew
It's kinda (?) too, but I am never gonna stop trying to grind and show you what I'm designed to do
Universal versatile verses, look it up
All the producers call me "hits" cause I hook it up
Now where's the wedding ring?
Don't smoke, but I Chief Rocka, yeah, something like the spaghetti thing
Jaronimo-P, lookin' out below
That's the mixtape I've got for you next year
(?) my rim, nah, you gon' have to lower it
Michael Jordan confidence, I promise you that I will get over it
And when I build my bridge: get over it
And all my homies at the bottom: get over it
And if I murder your song: get over it
Tall money, you can never get over it
And if your bees love my honey: get over it
And if you can't stand the heat: get over it
I got a beanstalk flow, get over it, you're over it, Streetz
