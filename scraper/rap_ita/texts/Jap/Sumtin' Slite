[Intro]
A-a-ahhh, yeah, haha
Ja, Sumtin' Slite
I'm about to show you why it's called "Sumtin' Slite"

[Verse 1]
Lehbump, and Ja-P killing everything
Took the game away from you, and gave that thing a wedding ring
Shout out to Spaghetti man, without them I don't know where I'd be
Uncle Wolf, thanks for pushing this music and now it's the air I breathe
I love the breeze, swiftly going my way
Nowadays I hear my music bumping down the highway
Yeah I'm chilling with the team: (?), Terra, (?), 'Tacia, Wesley Rose, and Ryane Payne
Look at the entire gang
Grinding every single day
I would talk about a skateboard but now it sounds too cliche
Ha, get your words straight
Getting a combo with Wrighteous, better be about this (?)
Having a combo with Clipz, better get your act together
Because he will cut, cut, cut you in a second and
Amore got the pipes, all we need is someone destined
And (?) got the subs in the backseat
My answer will be "Sumtin' Slite" to anything you ask me. streetz

[Hook]
Wake up in the morning, brush my teeth, brush my hair
Then I look up in the closet, it don't matter what I wear
When I walk up out the door, cameras flashing everywhere
I see twenty different questions but my answer to all of them is
What you wearing? (Sumtin' slite) Nice kicks (Sumtin' slite)
That's your car? (Sumtin' slite) Them your chicks? (Sumtin' slite)
Now for the rest of my life I'mma be on the grind, but just for tonight I'mma do a little (Sumtin' slite)

[Verse 2]
They be like, they be like, they be like
"Look at your kicks" (Sumtin' slite) "Look at your hat" (Sumtin' slite)
"Boy, you so fine" (Sumtin' slite) "Ja, you can rap" (Sumtin' slite)
Stay fresh (Sumtin' slite) Always cooking (Sumtin' slite)
If I didn't know any better, he'd be good looking
The Good L.O.O.K. Gang is the movement, better get moving
We zooming, cars from Peru, and we schooling all of your students
Choosing to be here snoozing, losing touch of your future
We ain't fading away, wait
Rep my city, never give it over to the fakes
Baby girl use no hands, T.O
Ja-President never signs deals, veto
We so trill never killed anything but some hot licks
Started from the bottom, now we here on the top list
I don't feel like writing the rest
I'm just gon' say what's on my chest
That's a real fat "S"
And right next to that is my mic
Don't like it then stop it
But it's only something slight, goodnight

[Hook]
