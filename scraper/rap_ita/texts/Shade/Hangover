[Hook 1]
And I think I got this hangover (yeah, yeah)
I wake and bake and then I smoke until the pains over
Hey I think I got this hangover (yeah, yeah)
It ain’t no telling when you know I bring the gang over (advil please)

[Verse 1]
Woke up kind of late shit was cray, last night I was gone
Who said you could stay, girl you told me you was going home
I been in the zone, shawty bad, I been on the road
Said she from LA, that’s her home, all she smoke is strong
She was off the rosé, I was off the Captain
She was tryna role play, I ain’t with the actin
Post that shit on IG, I ain’t like the caption
I know it’s a shame, but I ain't really know what happened
They know the wave, they know the sound
Girl where you stay, what side of town
I’m with the gang, we hold it down
Spinnin round and round, im trippin
Man I think i got this

[Hook 2]
Hangover
I wake and bake and then I smoke until the pains over
Hey I think I got this hangover (yeah, yeah)
It ain’t no telling when you know I bring the gang over (advil please)

[Verse 2]
Okay it’s not my first time that’s what we both say
Happened last night, but feel that shit the whole day
Hit a lick and then I pull up in the ghost face
Lil Spanish bitch she fine, I’m like olé
Swea I do this every time let it go away
Don’t be getting out of line cause we don’t play
And you would think it was a crime the way these niggas hate
They tryna stop a nigga grind but there ain’t no way

[Ramp]
They know the wave they know the sound
Girl where you stay what side of town
I’m with the gang they hold it down
Spinnin round and round im trippin
Man I think i got this

[Hook 3]
Hangover
I wake and bake and then I smoke until the pains over
Hey I think I got this hangover (yeah, yeah)
It ain’t no telling when you know I bring the gang over

Advil please...
