[Hook]
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good

[Verse 1: Charr]

Bring the beat in
And hear the story of my friend who's street sleeping
The beatings; they'll come
The meetings; we won
I fucked with you hitta
I loved you my nigga
Man it's fucked up how you got fucked over

People in your life, they just fucking rolled over
They let you out and let you down
I'm sorry about how you're living your life about now
But you can come hang with me; you can come live with me
I don't want you on those fucking streets

Come into my custody; comfortably you'll live
No worries of what you did
Fuck them for being that way, fuck what they hid
I don't give a fuck what happened
I don't give a fuck what you did
Bitch

I'd rather have you here, fuck what they forbid
We can hang out like kids again; fuck girls that's digging it
Fuck any prize if we winning it
I don't give a fuck who's digging it
If we needing it - we getting it

If it's money man we whipping it
If it's fans man we rapping it
If it's food man we stealing it
If it's yours man we taking it

I'm feeling this
How I'm meaning this?
How real is this?
How mean is it?
I feel this shit

[Hook]
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good

[Verse 2: Shade]

I miss that kid - the one with the glasses
The one by my side when we kicking people's asses
Man I just wish we could talk like we used to
Talk about ambitions, and things that we've been through

But now you're always gone, no longer on Skype
And the sad part is: no matter how hard you fight
It just seems that you always have to fight harder
Stress; stress; more fucking stress

No more talk about how you'll be the best
I hate to see you struggle; losing your breath
And If I really could, I'd clean this fucking mess
But it's a test homie and I know you'll pull through

It's just hard because I have to sit back until you do
I feel the fucking pain, because you're my fucking brother
While I'm out in the streets and you're going through your chemo
I remember the day I found out I could lose you

I wanted to drop everything and help in someway dude
Anything from bring you food to a fucking transplant
Shit while we're at it let's slide up a fucking plant
When I'm in my own trap; stuck in these streets

Nothing but a bag and some ICP beats
They're about to fall apart - these shoes on my feet
I'm about to collapse because my body's feeling weak
But I see a door open and you're rested in a seat

You open your mouth and you say a few words
Replay this song to figure out what I heard
And for this day I could never repay you
I'm just back home now; always worrying about you

[Outro]
And I'm feeling good
