[Chorus]
She say bae give me a chance, girl you had a chance yah
Told her fuck the truth, i don't want the answer
Please don't hit my line, i prolly won't answer
You playin' dumb, what you sayin'

She say bae give me a chance, girl you had a chance yah
Told her fuck the truth, i don't want the answer
Please don't hit my line, i prolly won't answer
You playin' dumb, what you sayin'

[Verse 1]
I've been dropin' time, bumpin' line
I'm so back and fort, out of my mind
Try to play it cool, but i can't hide it
All you had to do was keep it silent
Automatic, i ain't average
Had to stack it up
Came from nothin', Still strugglin'
She ain't havin' much
All that luggage, You can't bring it
That shit adding up
Most these niggas, Lip boxing
They just acting tough
Late night's, Hot Boxing out the Acura
Take it Back, Don't want it back
You can't back it up
Money calling, It's sticking to me
I can't pass it up
Shoot the shit, It ain't legit
Baby quit ...

[Chorus]
She say bae give me a chance, girl you had a chance yah
Told her fuck the truth, i don't want the answer
Please don't hit my line, i prolly won't answer
You playin' dumb, what you sayin'

She say bae give me a chance, girl you had a chance yah
Told her fuck the truth, i don't want the answer
Please don't hit my line, i prolly won't answer
You playin' dumb, what you sayin'

[Verse 2]
You ain't vibin', Out of timing
Out of site, Out of mind
You gon' slide, Don't know why
Just a flight, For the Night ...

You ain't vibin', Out of timing
Out of site, Out of mind
You gon' slide, Don't know why
Just a flight, For the Night ...

[Chorus]
She say bae give me a chance, girl you had a chance yah
Told her fuck the truth, i don't want the answer
Please don't hit my line, i prolly won't answer
You playin' dumb, what you sayin'
