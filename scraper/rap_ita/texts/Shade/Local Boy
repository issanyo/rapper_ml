[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Otown marco

[Hook 1]
Aye aye
I’m a old soul, I just peep things
Roll that dope smoke, that’s how we ease pain
Tell them take a photo, with the freeze frame
Hit em with the low blow, they say mean things
You just local boy, you just local boy
Like you not making noise
Nah who not making noise
You just local boy you just local boy
Like who not making noise
Like who not nah you not

[Verse 1]
Yall got me fucked up, this a G thing
Whole team said they proud of me
Grandma keep prayin, like give it a second
Cali to Texas the wave is aggressive
Counting my blessing so I’m never stressing
Call it my city then I tell them exit
Cause they didn’t want it, so I take the pressure
Damn, cameras pointed at the kid
Flashing lights like what it is
New persona dropping hits
So now he think he is the shit (Nah)
And she when to come around
Because it comes with benefits
Just know we out here taking risks
Cause I been hustling since a jit
You living backwards
Reality and talent is so hard to balance
Black on black status I’m the rap assassin
Shawty say she want me do she want the challenge
Damn and she gonna tell em run it back
And they gon bump that shit in traffic
At after parties they all blastin it
They just rappin it, like...

[Hook 2]
Aye aye
I’m a old soul, I just peep things
Roll that dope smoke, that’s how we ease pain
Tell them take a photo, with the freeze frame
Hit em with the low blow, they say mean things

Like you not making noise

You just local boy you just local boy
Like who not making noise
