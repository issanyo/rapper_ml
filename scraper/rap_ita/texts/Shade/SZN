[Verse 1]
Aye, look...
I’m like lord please tell me why we had to grow up
Went from hoopin at the park, to pour that liq up in my cup
Back in highschool, they was scared to show a nigga love
But I’m buzzin now, you should see the way they hit my up
They like, “Hey, I just listened to all your music and I like it”
It’s like that’s cool and all, but if you’re fucking with me, you should by it
With the black girls to white girls, I’m never really biased
Momma told me boy you need to stop chillin with all them white kids

Otowns very own we coming they wouldn’t understand
Niggas getting lazy they settling for a couple bands
We dancing to the check, nah I ain’t talking no running man
He got a little money this nigga think he the Money Man
From to Groupies to Ghouls to Flowcaine, you choose
To this that Blue December I been working in the stu
I been in the cut grinding like I got nothing to lose
Momma said, “If you not going to college, what you finna do?”
Man I’m finna just rap while I get this money
If I ever drop hit the ground still running
If I ever stop then I’m not one hundred
If I ever stop then I’m not one hundred
They don’t wanna see me cause I’m like who want it
Point em out, point em out, who want it
You don’t want beef you just tryna hate on me
They was all sleep, but I’m like good morning

Cause this that...

[Verse 2]
Yeah they come in the city thinking shit sweet
Aye you not talking business you can miss me
Aye Shawty hit my phone she said she miss me
Aye now she getting loose for a retweet
