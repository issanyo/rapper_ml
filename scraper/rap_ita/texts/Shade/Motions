[Hook 1]
Hit a lick, I’m switchin lanes
West Orlando with the gang
Gotta switch up when it change
Want the money and the fame
I’m a go out with a bang
I just showed out when I came
I swear shit ain’t been the same
That’s the motions of the game

[Verse 1]
I got the power to put it in motion
24 hours the trap always open
I want designer I want Gucci loafers
Shawty gone ride with me till this shit over
She got the power, but too much emotions
Wave like the ocean we drinking and smoking
These niggas bogus I cannot stay focused
Act like you know this you boys never posted
You tryna shine in that light, but I took it
I watch my back cause I know that they lookin
Bitch from Miami I can’t leave her cooking
They want me in Cali I told they ass book me
Back to back, flip words like an acrobat
Cloud 9 as a matter fact
That non-stop hot box in that ‘03 Cadillac
Can’t breathe like an asthma attack
Look, I got high hope for my haters
Y’all ain't getting no paper
And they just waiting on me
I just make them keep waiting
I just put it in motion
Everybody go through they phases
But if a nigga try me I might just pull up I ain’t got no patience



[Hook 2] (2x)
Hit a lick I’m switchin lanes
West Orlando with the gang
Gotta switch up when it change
Want the money and the fame
I’m a go out with a bang
I just showed out when I came
I swear shit ain’t been the same
That’s the motions of the game
