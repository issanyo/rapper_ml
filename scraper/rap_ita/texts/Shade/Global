[Verse 1]
It’s a victory, tell them it’s a victory
We just tryna face the world, make a couple memories
Grew up as local boy and now I think they feeling me
Flex up on my enemies, pull up like I’m Mr. T
….All of these chains up on me
Crazy when they said they know me
Cause I always keep that shit lowkey
My niggas strapped like the police
So if you got problems come show me
Pinky ring shining like Kobe
I know you watch from the nosebleeds
Double up, where we at, tryna get paid witit
Crowd surf when I hit the stage
You stuck making minimum wage
I wanna crib with a lake
People got nothing to say
I know you in the same place
That’s where you made a mistake, damn

[Hook 1]
If its worldwide, then we gon try
Cause it won’t die
That’s on my list, we all rise
Cause we tryna go Global
Global, global
We tryna go Global
Global, global

[Verse 2]
Told my momma when I leave I’m a come back with that check
Gotta family to feed, I ain’t got no time to rest
She just tell me what she need, watch a player at his best
And that girl gone off Hennessy, ain’t no tellin what she’ll do next
This rap shit is just not what you know it’s who you know
Niggas politic’n way more than they in the studio
I just touched down, Super Bowl, I got two to go
You should know these niggas is acting like a movie role
You think you right, but I know you wrong
Life is short but the grind is long
I do a show they know all my songs
Best believe that is the SZN even when I’m gone

[Hook 2]
If its worldwide, then we gon try
Cause it won’t die
That’s on my list, we all rise
Cause we tryna go Global
Global, global
We tryna go Global
Global, global
