[Hook 1] (2x)
90’s baby can’t nothing phase me don’t know about it come see
I’m just tryna play Smash Bros with a little bad bih rollin my weed
Why she talkin bout we, girl I ain’t talkin bout we
Playing games with me, Nintendo with that Wii (hit it)

[Verse 1]
Shit I been playing games till the day’s gone
She been playing games with me since day one
Saving hoes put your cape on
All I know is never chase one
All we know is hands up, don’t shoot
Either way get your face blown
Yellin fuck 12 with my shades on
How you think we felt when they killed Trayvon
I been living in the moment getting money
I could never let a nigga interrupt
You been rappin rappin for a long time
And to be honest you just need to give it up
Got the squad with me you should know we
Deeper than the Jonas brothers when we pullin up
Be a grown ass man playing games
Still saying I don’t give a fuck, damn
You can smell the gas through the window
You can smell the gas when the wind blow
Games after games that Nintendo
Someone tell them keep up with the tempo
You ain’t got no squad where yo friends go
I know you a op Carl Winslow
Bad bitch with me like 10-4
Take it to the floor like limbo

[Verse 2]
Runnin shit I got the cardio, shrooms with me like I’m Mario
I ain’t really tryna waste your time
Never said that I was sorry though
Trippin cause I’m playing Donkey Kong
Girl I Beat it up just like I’m Donkey Kong
You should know that I’m a fool with it
Girl just plug it up and take them panites off
Is you tryna go, tell me yes or no
You ain’t gotta cheat, unprofessional
Ain’t no x and o’s, get my check and go
That boy flexin though, fresh from head to toe
You know I’m the same, I know you the same
That’s gon never change cause we playing games
