(We smoke we roll)

[Verse 1]
Money calling I just check the voicemail
Couple groupie bitches at the hotel
It’s the season better act like you know well
Yeah my niggas seen it but we won’t tell
Run that check up like Usian Bolt
And all you niggas hatin in the same boat
Shawty switching sides that’s the game tho
Oh that’s yo man tho, he a lame what you saying

Chopsticks with the sushi while she actin Bad and Boujee
Get yo mind right, fuck a swisher roll a doobie

Gardens, gardens, trap out the apartment

[TrapSav, Verse 3]
Pull up then I park it, trappin right out of the charger
Roll up then I spark, it got the gas right out the garden
Remember days when I was broke, it was nice when I was starvin
Need a mill for the meals, I’m in the field like a farmer
Can’t take no deductions cause I got this shit from nothing
If it ain’t about no paper why the fuck would I be fussin bitch
If you try to take it ain’t no waitin I’m a bust it
You ain't gang you can’t hang them ones that I came up with
I be making movies with the set like a director
If its problems we correct em, free my niggas in corrections
I suggest you shut the fuck up, I don’t need none of yo suggestions
