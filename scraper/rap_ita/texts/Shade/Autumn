[Hook 1]
Okay you met somebody, but I’m not worried bout it
Please, that nigga ain’t worth the problem
You was just tryna get around it
Otown they can't forget about me
Party until we can’t allow it (yeah, yeah)
Summer feelings you probably caught em
Summers over the leaves are falling
I think it’s Autumn

[Verse 1]
Ghost ride it (skrt, skrt)
Watch my partner ghost ride it (skrt, skrt, skrt)
Niggas think they got a option
They getting a little too excited
You know I’m lifted when I’m arriving
You probably thought this was perfect timing
Know you hurting, you tryna hide it
On my end, I can’t stop thinking bout it
I think it’s Autumn

[Bridge]
Nonsense, nonsense, why they on that nonsense
Boolin on some mob shit, get my mind up off this
Do this shit like every day, higher than a cockpit
I just know she always tryna hit me with the plot switch
Nonsense, nonsense, why they on that nonsense
Boolin on some mob shit get my mind up off this
Do this shit like every day, higher than a cockpit
I just know she always tryna hit me with the plot switch

[Hook 2]
Okay you met somebody, but I’m not worried bout it
Please, that nigga ain’t worth the problem

Otown they can't forget about me

Summer feelings you probably caught em
Summers over the leaves are falling
I think it’s Autumn

[Verse 2]
She said you blowin up, I said tell me something new
Know I’m off the Goose
Aye, I mix it with the juice
Had niggas mad at me cause I really didn’t keep them in the loop
Got women in my face getting loose, I was tryna be with you
If it ain’t loud homie what you smoking
My niggas take that cause we be on it
That pussy poppin, but girl you know it
And that’s problem, cause girl you know it
Let the leaves fall, let the leaves fall
When it’s all silent, let the leaves fall
In my own zone I don’t see yall
Bitches come and go, I never recall
I see the leaves falling, I see the leaves fall
When it’s all silent, let the leaves fall
In my own zone, I don’t see yall
Bitches come and go, it’s never me callin

[Hook 3]
Okay you met somebody, but I’m not worried bout it

Summers over the leaves are falling
I think it’s Autumn
