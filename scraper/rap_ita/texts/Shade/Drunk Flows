[Verse 1]
Okay I’m reloaded I gave them the preview
One for the party two for the people
Ain’t got no problems, but smoke like we need to
Said you don’t smoke okay girl let me teach you
Gang in the cut that’s a whole different story
She let me hit I was swimming like Dory
Fifth of this Henny got you looking gorgeous
I can’t remember how you look before this
Bitch I’m off the yak, damn I’m off the yak
So bring that ass back
All of us trappin we all bout a sack
But that shit that you smoke
Can’t get jiggy with that
Lil Otown I hit it with no strings attached
Say that you ballin we pull up them stats
And I know you lying we pull out them facts
I’m like fuck what they heard I don’t like to chat

[Pre-Chorus]
They already know, I got the time and the growth
I got the drink and the smoke
As you can see Marco just flow on the beat
No they not fucking with me
They already know, I got the time and the growth
Said that you drunk, girl I know
As you can see, no they not fucking with me
No they not fucking with me

[Hook 1]
Cause we got thugs in the cut, we got subs in the trunk
Ain’t no love we just fuck, ain’t no love you just drunk
We got thugs in the cut, we got subs in the trunk
Ain’t no love we just fuck, ain’t no love you just drunk
Drunk Flows


[Verse 2]
But I remain on that G shit
Drunk flows you know the whole team lit
Shawty all in her feelings I tell her keep it
Cause she switch niggas like month no T Swift
Please, don’t think I ain't notice
Marco you know this, I flow like a poet
Cheers to the season I feel like I’m chosen
Girl it’s a new year you still on that old shit, just chill
Friends be acting petty, really ain’t necessary
You more like a visionary, that’s cool
But you cannot see me like Wizard Kelly
Just met us there at the telly
Don’t pull up if they ain’t ready
And most of my niggas they gonna be ready
But I’m never trippin I keep it steady
They hittin my celly, ain’t shit they can't tell me

[Hook 2]
Cause we got thugs in the cut, we got subs in the trunk
Ain’t no love we just fuck, ain’t no love you just drunk
We got thugs in the cut, we got subs in the trunk
Ain’t no love we just fuck, ain’t no love you just drunk
Drunk Flows
