[Intro]
I'm gonna give what you want, want, want
I'm gonna give what you want, want, want

[Chorus]
Gonna give you what you, what you, what you, what you, what you want
And I'm never giving in, I'm never giving up
'Cause I love it when we kissing and I love it when we touch
Every morning, every night, I wanna give you, give you, give you, give you
Give you what you, what you, what you, what you, what you want
And I'm never giving up, I'm never giving up
Gonna give you what you, what you, what you, what you, what you want
Every morning, every night, I wanna give you, give you, give you, give you

[Verse 1]
And in the morning when you waking up
I'll give you loving when the sun comes up
And in the night, when we turn out the lights...
We'll be closer, babe, is that alright?
And when it's hot outside, I'll make you sweat
And when its cold, I'll warm you up again
Oh baby, this is how its got to be
So if you give it all to me...

[Chorus]
Gonna give you what you, what you, what you, what you, what you want
And I'm never giving in, I'm never giving up
'Cause I love it when we kissing and I love it when we touch
Every morning, every night, I wanna give you, give you, give you, give you
Give you what you, what you, what you, what you, what you want
And I'm never giving in, I'm never giving up
Gonna give you what you, what you, what you, what you, what you want
Every morning, every night, I wanna give you, give you, give you, give you

[Verse 2]
And when you're working, I'll call on the phone
And tell you, "Baby, I want you at home"
So tell the boss you're sick, you gotta leave
And baby make it quick, oh baby, please
Break the red lights, hurry, hurry now
Dont watch the stop signs, I can't wait no more
I know you want me, yeah, I want you too
So babe, soon as I see you...

[Chorus]
Gonna give you what you, what you, what you, what you, what you want
And I'm never giving in, I'm never giving up
'Cause I love it when we kissing and I love it when we touch
Every morning, every night, I wanna give you, give you, give you, give you
Give you what you, what you, what you, what you, what you want
And I'm never giving up, I'm never giving up
Gonna give you what you, what you, what you, what you, what you want
Every morning, every night, I wanna give you, give you, give you, give you

[Bridge]
Give you what you want everyday and every night
If it's cold or if its' hot, baby, wet or not
Gonna give you what you want everyday and every night
If your awake or asleep, babe, I'll never stop
Give you what you want everyday and every night
If it's cold or if its' hot, baby, wet or not
Gonna give you what you want everyday and every night
If your awake or asleep, babe, I'll never stop

[Chorus]
Gonna give you what you, what you, what you, what you, what you want
Never giving up, I'm never giving up
'Cause I love it when we kissing and I love it when we touch
Every morning, every night, I wanna give you, give you, give you, give you
Give you what you, what you, what you, what you, what you want
And I'm never giving up, I'm never giving up
Gonna give you what you, what you, what you, what you, what you want
Every morning, every night, I wanna give you, give you, give you, give you
