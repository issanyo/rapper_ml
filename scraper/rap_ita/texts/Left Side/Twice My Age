[Intro: Vybz Kartel]
She thinking about the dollar bill
Mi nuh love her still....
Dollar, dollar bill
Dollar, dollar, dollar
Dollar, dollar bill, bi-...

[Chorus: Gaza Kim (Vybz Kartel)]
I'm in love with a man, nearly twice my age
Don't know what it is, but its a (dollar!) from me youthful days
As I go my way, I don't care what people say
I'm in love with a man, nearly twice my age!

[Verse 1: Vybz Kartel (Gaza Kim)]
Come now!
She nuh waan no idle jube, jube
Idle jube
She nuh waan no idle jube, jube
Idle jube
She want a man fi go' her the money plenty
A Manley she waan! No ten, no twenty
She nuh waan no soso, 'honey', gi' her di money
She nuh waan no soso, 'honey', gi' her di money!
Tell dem!

Let mi tell you girls, in my youthful days (jube, jube, jube)
I used to talk to other boys my age
Then the Gaza don, he came along
Made me smile all the while, fi him money tall and it's so strong
And him love long, long

[Verse 2: Vybz Kartel (Gaza Kim)]
Young man have strength, but them don't have a cent
She want a man fi gi' her recompense
True!
She waan pay lightbill and rent, and
Change di hairstyle every weekend (dollar bill)
Do di finger and di toe dem
Show off pon her friend, when time she show dem

Stood up for me when no one cared (dollar bill, bill, bi-)
Stood up for me when other men wouldn't dare
Made me know a true man's love
Never made me feel disowned
Never gave me love that's cold
(She thinking about the dollar bill)

[Verse 3: Vybz Kartel ]
If she want a big man, mi nah go say that she wrong
Cau' she a deal wid a foundation
Hear me young bwoy, mi nah mash up your plan
But, woman want house and land (dollar bill)
A how much you think fi a good dive'end
Bed and setty cost more than a grand
Cyan go a coast with two empty hand
A washing machine, she no use wash pan
A.C. she want, a no standing fan
Gaza Kim, sing fi mi, black woman!

[Chorus: Gaza Kim (Vybz Kartel)]
I'm in love with a man, nearly twice my age
Don't know what it is, but its a (dollar!) from me youthful days
As I go my way, I don't care what people say
I'm in love with a man, nearly twice my age!
