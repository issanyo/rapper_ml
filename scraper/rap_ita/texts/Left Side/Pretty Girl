[Intro: Tiggs Da Author]
Falling falling for you
Falling for you
Falling for you

[Chorus: Tiggs Da Author]
Pretty girl, you're taking your time
Why you do me like this?
You know me loving your whine
Pretty girl, you're giving me signs
Then you tell me you don't want me
Can you make up you mind?
Pretty girl, you're taking your time
Why you do me like this?
You know me loving your whine
Pretty girl, you're giving me signs
Then you tell me you don't want me
Can you make up you mind?

[Verse 1: Stefflon Don]
Me a gwan tan tuddy pon di buddy
When mi deh a Greenwich Farm
Rema bawl fi di sumn weh mek man run inna storm
From nineteen how long him a pree mi
Pretty face, and me eye dem dreamy
Mi nuh deady deady pon di sumn when me ride it
Quint mi position pon di back and me nuh slide it
Never get a love inna him life weh did like this
(Love inna him life weh did like this)

[Pre-Chorus: Stefflon Don]
Love when you, love when you hold me
Baby, don't control me
Just know I run the town and all these bruddas wan' know me
Said they gon' do me but they never do me
Just copped the bust down
So make a brudda try fool me

[Chorus: Tiggs Da Author]
Pretty girl, you're taking your time
Why you do me like this?
You know me loving your whine
Pretty girl, you're giving me signs
Then you tell me you don't want me
Can you make up you mind?
Pretty girl, you're taking your time
Why you do me like this?
You know me loving your whine
Pretty girl, you're giving me signs
Then you tell me you don't want me
Can you make up you mind?

[Bridge: Tiggs Da Author]
Falling falling for you
Falling for you
Falling for you
Falling falling for you
Falling for you
Falling for you

[Verse 2: Stefflon Don]
Cry me a river, but I hope you don't drown
Better be careful what you say outta your mouth
You know it ain't never safe when I'm around
They said bad girls never do no good, good
Got got it, got it all
It's diamonds on me, let it fall
Slow down
Babe, I got racks up on racks up, they don't flow down

[Pre-Chorus: Stefflon Don]
Love when you, love when you hold me
Baby, don't control me
Just know I run the town and all these bruddas wan' know me
Said they gon' do me but they never do me
Just cut the boss down
So make a brudda try fool me

[Chorus: Tiggs Da Author]
Pretty girl, you're taking your time
Why you do me like this?
You know me loving your whine
Pretty girl, you're giving me signs
Then you tell me you don't want me
Can you make up you mind?
Pretty girl, you're taking your time
Why you do me like this?
You know me loving your whine
Pretty girl, you're giving me signs
Then you tell me you don't want me
Can you make up you mind?
Pretty girl, you're taking your time
Why you do me like this?
You know me loving your whine
Pretty girl, you're giving me signs
Then you tell me you don't want me
Can you make up you mind?
Pretty girl, you're taking your time
Why you do me like this?
You know me loving your whine
Pretty girl, you're giving me signs
Then you tell me you don't want me
Can you make up you mind?
