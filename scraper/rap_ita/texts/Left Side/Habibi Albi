[Intro]
Look around
Ready to make some babies
With the ladies
Leftside, Faydee
Ha-ha-ha-ha

[Bridge]
Habibi albi
Let me lo-lo-lo-lo-lo love you like you need
You deserve somebody
To treat you like a queen, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
When you come home
She’s standing there naked
She said, baby hurry up
Don’t keep me waiting
She makes you feel good
Yeah, that’s my baby
You got it good
So, don’t you waste it (Look around)
She could be your lover
She could be your friend
She give you what you want
Make you feel like a man
But you gotta be honest
Don’t tryina pretend
Don’t give her any reason
To never trust again

[Chorus 1]
Habibi albi
Let me lo-lo-lo-lo-lo love you like you need (I’ll give you what you need)
You deserve somebody
To treat you like a queen, oh-oh
Ana, ana, ana bahlan fiki ana
Habibi albi
Let me lo-lo-lo-lo-lo love you like you need
Oh-oh habibi

[Post-Chorus 1]
Toca loca loca
Oh-oh, habibi
Toca loca loca
Oh, Leftside
Oh-oh, habibi

[Verse 2]
It’s goin down from the bed to the ground street
Top one top one, girl you deserve a crown
I will make boom when you girl go top one
Get you deep another zone with deep
You feel what I mean when I hit your G spot
No lie between your legs full stream
You deserve better, let me start make you wet
When times get cooler, keep you warm like a supergirl
You deserve the best, no take less
You’re full of hopeness, you deserve happiness
Like birds in the tree, living in a happy nest
Fulfilling my dream with my queen

[Chorus 2]
Habibi albi
Let me lo-lo-lo-lo-lo love you like you need
You deserve somebody
To treat you like a queen (Li-li-like a queen)
Ana, ana, ana bahlan fiki ana
Habibi albi
Let me lo-lo-lo-lo-lo love you like you need (Baby girl)
Oh-oh habibi

[Post-Chorus 2]
Toca loca loca
Oh-oh habibi
Toca loca loca
Look around
Oh-oh habibi

[Outro]
Ana, ana bahlan fiki ana
Habibi ana, ya ayni ana
Oh-oh, habibi albi
Let me lo-lo-lo-lo-lo love you like you need
You deserve somebody
To treat you like a queen
Oh-oh habibi
