[Intro]
We keep the girls busy
You know it's Busy Signal and Tami
She can't get enough of me
Yo
Sing it!

[Chorus: Tami Chynn]
It's all because of you
I'm never sad and blue
You came my way
Now my life is like a sunny day
And I love you so
How much? You'll never know
Don't ever take your love from me
No, no, no

[Verse 1: Busy Signal]
Girl
A just your cuteness, your tightness
You know me really like it

Letters and poems me write and recite it
When me fling it give, fling it back, me nah go sight it

[Chorus 2: Tami Chynn]

[Verse 2: Busy Signal]
Mi gyal, you look prett-tt-tt-tt-tty

Skin smooth, you nuh spot-t-t-t-ty

But no chocolat-t-t-t-te

And I love you so

No, no, no
