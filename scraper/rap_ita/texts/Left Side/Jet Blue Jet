Oh oh oh oh what a pity
Be smoking and joking until I talk stupidity
I am so higher than the city
Be fly in the clouds, what a view, so pretty
I’m such a bad boy, P Diddy
We got them notorious like Biggie
You smoke, smoke like a chu chu train
This, I grace, coming through the brain
To the brain
To the brain
To the brain
To the brain

In the sky, above the clouds
With the birds, with the birds
Sky, above the clouds
With the birds, with the birds

(Bridge)
Can’t hide from me, me say me boy I’m to be high
I was born to be, born to climb
Can’t hide from me, me say me boy I’m to be high
I was born to be, born to climb
