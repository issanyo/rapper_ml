[Verse 1]
The tightness a your thing, one of your assets
Man a rush you, water a run like faucet
Baby boo, you're full of glue like Pattex

You have up the glimmity, the glammity
Make your man float like there is no gravity
Nah drink no bag juice fi give you no cavity
Hold up your sittin and grab it-it-it

[Verse 2]
Your needle eye, through deh the tread go!
Nuff man want fi give you dem bed flow

Waistline grip him, nuh have fi put your head low
Gyal, your face intact, tight and fat
Full of glammity when you bring that, when skin slap
No rash nuh pon you skin tag
Nuh lick fi him pop
Him try lef', and the sittin bring him back

[Chorus]
