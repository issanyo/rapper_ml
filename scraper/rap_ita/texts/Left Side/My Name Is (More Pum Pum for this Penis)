[Intro]
Space was cool...
Muahahahaha

I have a very evil plan, now see
Man to man - no
That's not something a dude should do to another dude
It's kinda creepy

You ready Mini Me?

[Verse 1]
My name is Dr. Evil
I'm trying to find a reason why
Should a next man lie with a guy whose name is Stephen?
I love pumpum, fat cacumcum
Black, brown, square or round
I will never like Trevor
I'll prefer wife-ing a heifer
I brought this AK, to spray on all gays
Including Outrage!
Who's fighting all our DJs
Gunshots for all you faggots
I really hate you maggots
All I really need is
More pumpum for this penis

[Chorus]
JA don't like it no, JA don't like it no
JA don't like it no, JA don't like it no
Nothing can stop me from ridding the earth of...
JA don't like it no, JA don't like it no
Battyboys, Chichis, Sodomites, Dykes
JA don't like it no, JA don't like it no

[Verse 2]
Yo
Pumpum, yes, it's the best thing
Next to the breast, the chest thing
We nuh investing
(So how some man inna tights of the wrestling?)
In pieces we'll leave them resting
*Brrring, click*
Hello, testing
If you're into child molesting
Gunshots will tear your intestines
Gay life we show no interest in

[Chorus]
JA don't like it no, JA don't like it no
JA don't like it no, JA don't like it no
We have a very evil plan
JA don't like it no, JA don't like it no
And nothing can stop me
JA don't like it no, JA don't like it no
