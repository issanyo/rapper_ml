[Intro]
Sick Luke, Sick Luke

[Ritornello: Sick Luke]
Comin' around me like a thot
These streets are cold and full of drugs
When you are all alone from home
It's easy to lose when you don't know where to go
Comin' around me like a thot
These streets are cold and full of drugs
When you are all alone from home
It's easy to lose when you don't know where to go

[Strofa 1: Duke Montana]
I grew up with nothing
With homies on corners drug smuggling
Trying to get out the ghetto, just hustling
The future wasn't bright
Growing up I wasn't born with the silver spoon
My dad didn't raise me, no, fool
My momma wanted me at school
But that was hard
Headed, headed in the wrong direction
The hood, could've that took me on the streets
Talent make injections
[?]
Make a wrong move and you fail
Just like my G that went to jail
He started smoking crack
He used rap but now he quit
He had a lot of talent but the drugs made him sick
He started fighting with his brother
His motherwould cry everyday, watching him deteriorate
The drugs took the smile off his face, he was living in hell
[?] he wasn't living well
My homie sorrow echoes in these cold streets
He feels slowly, the struggle is hard, shit is mad deep
Check it out!

[Strofa 2: Sick Luke]
Shine like a star
I grow with my dad
Just smoking clouds while I spit this bars
Always stay calm, always stay up
They want your energy, they want your sound
But I am strong, so fuck 'em
Big jungle, everybody's lost
