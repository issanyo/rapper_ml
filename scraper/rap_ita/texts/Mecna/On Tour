[Verse 1: LD]
Lurk with gang, I do it a lot
First it's Oz, man I drop that down
Treat that like the opps
Don't matter if you lack or not
Still get dropped, beat down and shot
Get gwop, get weapons
On site pagans, stay healthy, drop
Look, you don't run your postcodes
So they talk places you don't go
See the 44, slap three man
Still hitting notes like [?]
Don't wonder why I'm with man
You know the shit I did for my gang
All the opps know when L's about
It's never safe where they hang
I jumped out and they ran
They never see shit in my hands
They're filthy impostors, wastemen, tramps
I've got live corn for their batch
And this ain't leaving no scratch
We run riots in these flats
Six gang to the world and back

[Hook: LD & Liquez]
Jump out gang, we touring
In Germany or Italy, the UK gets boring
I don't know myself no more, I'm out here whoring
All these European hoes thought UK got boring
Take this warning
All this falling
I might start some foreign beef 'cause UK got boring
Jump out gang (ah)
Jump out gang (drilla)
Jump out gang (ah)
Jump out gang (drilla)
Jump out gang (ah)

[Verse 2: Monkey]
Roll up and smoke
Same way man drill him up
Just roll up and smoke
Hid guns in the opp block
Yeah them pussy boy know
Do a drill, do a drill
Come back sweating, thinking 'bout chro'
Mans took a tour on a opp block
Thinking where the fuck are these hoes?
Billboard and posters round South, niggas dem know
Do a drill in the afternoon, I ain't fucking at a show (Gang, gang!)
Skidding round with four man in that [?]
Sirens, man swerve that
Man ain't tryna eat from blue bowls
Jump out, jump out gang
We local, tryna take [?]
Them niggas just talking
Man's really mobbing [?]
Smoke man in a quick jiff
Then came back and said "Yo"
Never get it twisted
Been mashing work pon the road
About time the gang blow
Four figures for a show
On a back road with click clack
And that miss man, that's my bro
Had to rise the mash, let it blow
Then done a dash, ten toes

[Hook: LD & Liquez]
Jump out gang, we touring
In Germany or Italy, the UK gets boring
I don't know myself no more, I'm out here whoring
All these European hoes thought UK got boring
Take this warning
All this falling

Jump out gang (ah)
Jump out gang (drilla)
Jump out gang (ah)
Jump out gang (drilla)
Jump out gang (ah)

[Verse 3: Liquez]
He said "Lowe it", I said "Fuck that, na I ain't hearing a thing"
M got twenty-five in that MAC10
Just know we could tare it at them
Niggas face on the front page of the Sky News, like that's another murder again
There's real shit happening here when on the other side all they do is pretend
What's wrong with these fools and gems?
Don't you know we're posted on your own ends?
Didn't know we're coming with the big long skeng
And it holds six shots so you know who's dead
Rise that, mash up, bang at them
I don't give a fuck if he's friend of a friend
Just know that my shooting's ten out of ten
Na I won't miss nothing, I make sure he's dead
I'm mad and fucking vexed
Get a opp done then I'm like "Who the fuck's next?"
And I won't talk, you could get whacked in your head like I've got T-Rex
Then I got bagged, I done it on a mate's bait face so the case was mentz
But free [?], he got six years, yeah my [?]
67 fool, yeah we're still OG
All shutting down shows and skengman plays
Bare lights in my face when I'm up on the stage
Parked off then gone where the 50 stays
Come round your man, na we don't play games
Then I skurred from feds tryna lock me away
Then I hit my gaff then [?] bait
