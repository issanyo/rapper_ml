[Hook]
I can't even watch you bitch
I do my own thang, yea
I can't even watch you bitch
I do my own thang, yea
Pull up like casino slots
Swerve out both lanes, yea
I can't even watch you bitch
I do my own thang, yea
King of hill
With the Propane
Bitch
Smokin clean
Two gold chains
She catching feelings
I can't say I feel the same, yea
I can't even watch you bitch I do my own thang, yea

[Verse 1]
Ay, Okay
Too much sauce when I drip
Can't take a loss can't miss
Ray Charles to the risks
Got it lookin like a fuckin bake off
I done broke down a zip
Soda dirty like flint water
Nigga pop a seal i'm gettin lit
I done faced off with the good, bad, n ugly
Still I ain't quit
Seen my first money counter when met the plug
Been grinding ever since
Trash back full of bricks
Lookin like he on the stove cookin grits
I knew right there then i fell in love wit gettin money quick

[Hook]
I can't even watch you bitch
I do my own thang, yea
I can't even watch you bitch
I do my own thang, yea
Pull up like casino slots
Swerve out both lanes, yea
I can't even watch you bitch
I do my own thang, yea
King of hill
With the Propane
Bitch
Smokin clean
Two gold chains
She catching feelings
I can't say I feel the same, yea
I can't even watch you bitch I do my own thang, yea


[Verse 2]
Yeah
Don't pass me, no mid grade
What Imma do with that
Shit, that I'm on have you stuck in this bitch like a booby trap
She wanna act like she ain't with the shits but she know bout that life she ain't new to that
Players get chose don't come around with that thirsty shit nigga be cool with that
Feel like first round draft pick
First down , I work hard for every inch
I can't pay you attention
Name don't even get mentioned when I'm round this bitch
Pop out like a busted hip
Girls on a nigga like I hit a lick
I just do my own thang
She don't even know my name but she on my dick


[Hook]
I can't even watch you bitch
I do my own thang, yea
I can't even watch you bitch
I do my own thang, yea
Pull up like casino slots
Swerve out both lanes, yea
I can't even watch you bitch
I do my own thang, yea
King of hill
With the Propane
Bitch
Smokin clean
Two gold chains
She catching feelings
I can't say I feel the same, yea
I can't even watch you bitch I do my own thang, yea
