[Verse 1]
Yo, flew to Milan
Hella baggage in my hands
Didn't come here with the gang
I'm just flexing, that's the plan
I've been getting money on the low
Couple hating, that's just how it goes
Never planned it, I just let it flow
Banging bookings, I've been getting shows
It's me, the one that's so key
The trackie bottoms, I keep it so G
I'm out of your league, the drink is so lean
I'm 'bout to turn up with [?], my G
I took a risk, I took the gamble
Got gold on my wrist, don't flex with bangles
No B-Day cake, I blew my candles
I got the wave them man can't handle

[Hook]
Is that what you wa-want?
I been flexing everyday
Is that what you wa-want?
I'll be running to the cake
Is that what you wa-want?
Hella niggas on my case
Is that what you wa-want?
That's not what you wa-want

[Verse 2]
Uh, I do not smoke
But you know that I'm 'bout to blow
Been raining now I'm 'bout to snow
Ooh, flowing so cold
They wanna hang like it's suicide
I wanna chill, I don't play with fire
Studio everyday, that's my life
Going broke, come on now, that's a lie
I went missing like I'm Madison
Came back with the hit, the hammers in
Haters are riding the bandwagon
Just get off, I'll get you a Addison
B-O-A to the S-Y
I've got class, you ain't never gotta test I
Got the whole place whipped, no test ride
Uh, I've been tryna get a next height

[Hook]
Is that what you wa-want?
I been flexing everyday
Is that what you wa-want?
I'll be running to the cake
Is that what you wa-want?
Hella niggas on my case
Is that what you wa-want?
That's not what you wa-want
