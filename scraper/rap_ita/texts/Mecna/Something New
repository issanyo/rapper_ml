[Verse 1: SiR]
I found another life in London, it's true
I fell in love with the summer, fell in love with you
You shine your light in the winter, I'll miss the darkest view
Now it's the perfect season, to swim the deepest blue

[Chorus: SiR & Etta Bond]
And if everything else falls apart, I still have you
If I can't find my way back home, we'll make something new
Something new

[Verse 2: Etta Bond]
Now we off, one another, it's true
Something like no other
Tell me, what would you do if she was me?
Tell me, how would you move if we're afraid?

[Chorus: SiR & Etta Bond]
And if everything else falls apart, I still have you
If I can't find my way back home, we'll make something new
Something new
Something new
Something new
Something new

[Outro: Kate & SiR]
