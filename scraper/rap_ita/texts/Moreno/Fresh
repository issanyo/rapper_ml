Ask your girl if you wanna come thru
So you turned head right and you see me lookin' at you
I'm not sorry baby girl, cause I had to
You're the most gorgeous thing in the club right?
That's why I really had to make you coming my side
Aww you catch me see me watchin' you body
Act like we together grab my hand, show everybody
I know you want it too, that's why you passed my way
Baby girl you really nice I'd do it everyday
Yeah we really gotta do a second straight
