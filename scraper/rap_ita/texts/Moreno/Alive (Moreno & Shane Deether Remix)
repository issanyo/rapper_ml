[Verse 1]
Say you're going somewhere far away
Where sunshine lasts forever and a day
You say that suddenly skies are clear
It's time to disappear from here
Paradise, we're on our way, hey

[Chorus]
I wanna come with you baby right now
I'll take passenger seat, you drive
I wanna come with you baby right now
I don't care where you're going
Just glad I'm feeling alive
Alive, alive
Glad I'm feeling alive
Alive, alive

[Verse 2]
Top down, feel the wind in our face
Radio on, feeling the bass
Think I'm in love with your carelessness
What the hell, I feel a bit reckless
It feels good to get away, hey

[Chorus]
I wanna come with you baby, right now
I'll take passenger seat, you drive
I wanna come with you baby, right now
I don't care where you're going
Just glad I'm feeling alive
Alive, alive
Glad I'm feeling alive
Alive, alive

[Bridge]
Look up ahead, see the waves and the sand
Look up ahead, two bodies holding hands

[Chorus]
I wanna come with you baby, right now
I'll take passenger seat, you drive
I wanna come with you baby, right now
I don't care where you're going
Just glad I'm feeling alive
Alive, alive
Glad I'm feeling alive
Alive, alive

[Chorus]
I wanna come with you baby, right now
I'll take passenger seat, you drive
I wanna come with you baby, right now
I don't care where you're going
Just glad I'm feeling alive
Alive, alive
Glad I'm feeling alive
Alive, alive
Glad I'm feeling alive
Glad I'm feeling alive
I don't care where you're going
Just glad I'm feeling alive
