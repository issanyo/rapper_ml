[Intro]
Have you ever breathed?
(Breathed)
Have you ever breathed?
(Breathed)

[Hook]
(Have you ever breathed?)
How many go with no food to eat?
How many forced to roll the streets?
How many have much and still want more?
Yet so many dying poor
(Breathe)
How many work at nine to five, but then still find it hard to survive?
[?], while the rich getting rich of it sure
(Breathe)
How many sick and can't find no cure?
How many pray three hours or more?
How many can't get to say goodbye?
That's why in all things try to...

[Chorus]
Be grateful
For the things you have, be grateful
For the life you got, be grateful
What you take for granted now, somebody is wishing for so...
Be grateful
For the things you have, be grateful
For the life you got, be grateful
What you take for granted now, somebody is wishing for

[Verse 1]
(Breathe)
How many living in an crisis, lost in darkness and still searching for brightness?
(Breathe)
Some can't find joy to laughter
Horfan kids with no mother or no father
(Breathe)
How many living life lonely, no one to hold, no one to share them moments?
(Breathe)
When you face the facts, if you have life give thanks for what you got...

[Chorus]
Be grateful
For the things you have, be grateful
For the life you got, be grateful
What you take for granted now, somebody is wishing for so...
Be grateful
For the things you have, be grateful
For the life you got, be grateful
What you take for granted now, somebody is wishing for

What you take for granted now, somebody is wishing for
