[Chorus: Black Beat Movement]
Just show me the way
I feel so high
Overcomin' the bad vibes
I feel soul-satisfied

I'm weary coz it's really
Complicated to stop
Ain't easy look ahead and be wise
Be powerful!

[Verse 1: Black Beat Movement]
I'm ready to come back
I'm ready for that
Neck and neck with my past
Won't take long time for me to choose the best
Show me something I could go back for
Something I could go back for
Intoxicated by the days and facts that happened to me
Intoxicated by the days and things that happened to me

[Chorus: Black Beat Movement]
I'm weary coz it's really
Complicated to stop
Ain't easy look ahead and be wise
Be powerful!

[Verse 2: Tormento]
Just wanna be the next step soopafly
Flyin' higher your insane life
I'm connected with ma ancient ancestors
Ma descendants ancestral patterns
I'm sacred geometry not your ordinary binary matrix
Redesignin' biology livin' here now
In a universe non static empathic
Listen this is (sumthin') u been missing
Faith is just rememberin' how to healing illness
Loose all the chains u got
Play for the chance u got, Dawg!

[Chorus: Black Beat Movement]
Just show me the way
I feel so high
Overcomin' the bad vibes
I feel soul-satisfied
