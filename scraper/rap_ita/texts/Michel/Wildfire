[Verse 1]
Feel the calm before the storm
I'll be leaving in the morning
You were my sweet summer song
But the summer's gone and I can't keep your fire burning

[Pre-Chorus]
You're poison running through my veins
End it with a spark into a pool of gasoline

[Chorus]
Wildfire
Flames rising
Hit me like a bullet
Finger on the trigger, pull it, pull it
Wildfire, burn baby
Burn for me

[Verse 2]
Castles crash into the sand
As they're swept into the sea
I could never understand
How you're easy come easy go
As you please

[Pre-Chorus]
You're poison running through my veins
End it with a spark into a pool of gasoline

[Chorus]
Wildfire
Flames rising
Hit me like a bullet
Finger on the trigger, pull it, pull it
Wildfire, burn baby
Burn for me

Wildfire
Wildfire, wildfire
Wildfire, burn baby
Burn for me

[Bridge]
Let me go let me go
Let me go let me go
Let me go let me go
Let me go let me go

[Chorus]
Wildfire
Flames rising
Hit me like a bullet
Finger on the trigger, pull it, pull it
Wildfire, burn baby
Burn for me

[Outro]
Wildfire
Wildfire, wildfire
Wildfire, burn baby
