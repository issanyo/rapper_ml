[VERSE]:
Call me Benteke Benteke, cause what I wanna do I know I can make it
If there is a chance I will take it and show everyone I am who they been waiting on
Call me Benteke Benteke cause I'm someone a lot of people been hating on
Now they see how I do and man, I'm doing good so guess who is the one they have faith in now?
Call me Benteke cause whenever people got doubts, I prove 'em they're wrong
They said the game is not for me and they said the game is not where I belong
I'm showing the opposite and I ain't done, cause I'm still young yeah
Call me Benteke Benteke because Congo and Belgium is where I'm from
Lukaku Lukaku, even though I am not as large
But when I'm in charge, I go so hard I might need a massage
I'm open I like every kind of women, Miley Cyrus or Nicki Minaj
Benteke Benteke cause I want a villa with an Aston in the garage, vroom
Don't know where you at, I'm in the cap', I'm in my zone
Call me Benteke Benteke cause I'm with my team I never walk alone
I feel like a boss like I'm Kompany
I will be the boss of a company
Somebody tell money to come to me because you know it belong to me yeah
Bolasie Bolasie, call me Bolasie cause DRC is what I'm reppin'
They don't see the intentions of being the best ever, it's now or never
I'm way too clever, that's not what they said at school but whatever
Man F their opinion, look through the ceiling
Sir Axy Ferguson, he's in the building He's killing it, bang
Benteke, Benteke, Benteke, Benteke, Benteke, Benteke
Cause I do my best when I'm in
Never wanna lose, all I do is win
All I do is score, when I do I'm thanking the lord
And you can call me Eden Hazard, cause I'm shorter than you but I'm better by far
Yeah
