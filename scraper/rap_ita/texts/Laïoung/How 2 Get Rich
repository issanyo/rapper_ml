[Intro]
Laioung in your eardrum

[Hook]
How to get rich, rich, rich
All of my life yes I have to admit
How to be rich, rich, rich
Counting this racks, you know I'm getting rich
Counting this racks, you know I'm getting rich
I don't want problems, I'm just getting rich
How to be rich, rich, rich
Nobody gon' write a book 'bout that shit
How to be rich, rich, rich
Nobody gon' write a book 'bout that shit
How to be rich
Nobody gon' tell you how to do it
How to be rich, rich, rich
You gotta do it all by yourself
How to be rich
Count on yourself and on nobody else

[Verse]
Pockets on, pockets on swole
Twenties they are in my road
Fifties they are in my road
I got a hundred I got more
So many racks [?]
How do you [?] in the floor
If they rolling I just call em
Talking of millions yeah I want em
I don't like to get rich
Rather buy is so simple
Gotta think about my own
Never owe 'em, I'mma own
No, no, no more crying anymore
In the hood I got the love
Collect the mula [?]
Suddenly everything's real
Sometimes it doesn't feel real
But I feel every feel cause I know how we feel
(I know how we feel)
Italy we are the hardest
Have you ever been to Europe?
I was born and I was starving

[Hook]
How to get rich, rich, rich
All of my life yes I have to admit
How to be rich, rich, rich
Counting this racks, you know I'm getting rich
Counting this racks, you know I'm getting rich
I don't want problems, I'm just getting rich
How to be rich, rich, rich
Nobody gon' write a book 'bout that shit
How to be rich, rich, rich
Nobody gon' write a book 'bout that shit
How to be rich
Nobody gon' tell you how to do it
How to be rich, rich, rich
You gotta do it all by yourself
How to be rich
Count on yourself and on nobody else
