[Into: Laïoung]
Diamonds dance on my chest
(Laïoung in your eardrum)

[Hook: Alexander & Laïoung]
I'm fresh I don't need to impress
I don't need to impress
I'm fresh I don't need to impress
Diamonds dance on my chest
I'm rocking designer the best
True, only the best
I'm rocking designer the best (whooo)
Oh yeah
Iceberg, iceberg, ([?]) iceberg (see)
Iceberg, iceberg, ([?]) iceberg (fresh)
Aaahh, fresh, iceberg swag
Iceberg, iceberg, Aaah (yeah)

[Verse 1: Laïoung]
Why are you looking at me?
Cause you see I work night and day no stop, bitch
Why they be hating on me?
Iceberg floating so I’m never gone drop, bitch
Counting these euros yes I got too many
Frying plantains while you watch me on tele
Milano Rome
Gwap that I hold
But when it call never keep it on hold
Italy lit that call it litaly
I put this country on fire
She acting tough yeah cause she feeling me
I say the truth like the Messiah
Iceberg fresh
I stay fresh
Dj Khaled
We the best

[Bridge: Laïoung]
Hmmm
Counting and counting, these euros [?] and pounds
(Count it up, count it up)
Diamonds dance on my chest
I never need to impress
Buy a house and invest
Buy some new VVS

[Hook: Alexander & Laïoung]
I'm fresh I don't need to impress
I don't need to impress
I'm fresh I don't need to impress
Diamonds dance on my chest
I'm rocking designer the best
True, only the best
I'm rocking designer the best (whooo)
Oh yeah
Iceberg, iceberg, ([?]) iceberg (see)
Iceberg, iceberg, ([?]) iceberg (fresh)
Aaahh, fresh, iceberg swag
Iceberg, iceberg, Aaah (yeah)

[Verse 2: Alexander]
All I see now is future
I remember I was ruthless
But things changed for the better
And now I'm riding in a roofless (coupeee)
God bless, hallelujah
I have a dream, I have to prove it
To all of my people, my movement
Laioung recording, filmmaking, producing
Stacking them racks with the music
Underwater there's an iceberg
Life is short and fulla hard work
My wardrobe, it'll be full of clothes
Shooting them covers and catwalks
Across the ocean for commercials
And I only get the best roles
Fashion week and it's rehearsals (shows, shows)
Ice cold like the south pole
Only designer my payroll
Living the life that I chose
Got my advance on 'em contract
You cannot fuck me on commas
I'm just not reading your comments
Living my life staying honest

[Hook: Alexander & Laïoung]
I'm fresh I don't need to impress
I don't need to impress
I'm fresh I don't need to impress
Diamonds dance on my chest
I'm rocking designer the best
True, only the best
I'm rocking designer the best (whooo)
Oh yeah
Iceberg, iceberg, ([?]) iceberg (see)
Iceberg, iceberg, ([?]) iceberg (fresh)
Aaahh, fresh, iceberg swag
Iceberg, iceberg, Aaah (yeah)
