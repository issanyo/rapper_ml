Ohu woah
Ouu

(La√Øoung in your eardrum)
[Hook]
I know you're heartbroken
I try to do my best to bring where are you were
You know that I'm (deceased?)
Are you gonna do something 'bout it
I understand you, like nobody
I understand you, like nobody
I understand you, like nobody
So if I don't worry, you should worry

[Verse]
No, no, no you should worry
Baby, baby, baby you worried
Don't you worry
Don't you worry
(I just want to see your smile)
Don't (?) hate me
Don't (?) to love me
My soul is (?) for you, you're never lonely
Whatever you want
I will ride, I will get it
I will ride, I will get it
For us baby

[Hook]
I know you're heartbroken
I try to do my best to bring where are you were
You know that I'm (deceased?)

I understand you, like nobody
I understand you, like nobody (like nobody)
I understand you (understand you), like nobody (like nobody)
So if I don't worry, you should worry

[Verse]

If I don't worry than you should worry
If I don't worry than you should worry
