[Hook]
Ole Ole Ole Ole
Imma go and get some money
Ole Ole Ole Ole
I don't get tired of getting payed
I got Medusa on my face
I got Medusa on my waist
I gotta handle my business, and then I pull up on your face like
Ole Ole Ole Ole
Ole Ole Ole Ole
Ole Ole Ole Ole
Ole Ole Ole Ole
I'm just tryna see the money
I'm just tryna see the money
I'm just tryna see the money
I'm just tryna see the money

[Verse 1]
Twenty forty eighty hundred
Multiplying all the numbers
Multiplying all the numbers
Hide the money in a forest
I ain’t never had a bank
And I know so many people
I won’t ever see again
You can see me in a Foreign when I pull up with the clique
But to me it isn’t foreign, it’s a European whip
Got my European squad, money all in the garage
Can’t you see that we bossing: can’t you see that we flossing
Cause you know I’m a boss, only count on my wings
They gone do what it takes, cause they don’t wanna see you win
So if they want me to stay, bring the money to the table
Cause I’m still celebrating
In a different location

[Verse 2]
I ain’t saw the money, I ain’t looking at your face
Prices going up they ain’t never gonna fade
I know that my mamas birthday is in May
Pull up in the front of the store like “should I wait?!” Ok
At the front of the store of Versace
And I got rings on, Liberace
And I got no time I don’t party
When they call me I just go, that’s the hard me
I ain’t never worry, you know that imma go get more
They be like: ”where you go get it?” I get in inside store
I’m keeping my hands clean
You know that my pockets full
My hands used to be dirty
But I told em no more yeah
