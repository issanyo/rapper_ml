[Intro: Laïoung ]
Laioung
What you know what you know ah
What you know what you know ah

[Strofa 1: Laïoung]
What you know 'bout the streets just before I hit the top
I was born, I was broke, I was living on the block
With my mum, no food and no money in the crib
And I had to go and hustle, what you knew about what I did
What I do, who I am, always stand up never sit
When I want the gang to run up you can watch a marathon
In the zone, Do you know that we've been trappin' at the park
I got products in the boxes, many soldiers going hard
Real talk, water frizzy at least it, ain't sweet at all
We ain't talkin' 'bout this money we running straight to the ball
Never talk
We just posted in the hood feeding dogs
What you know about Paris I go there like every fall
Winter time
Saturday I'm steady flexing with the tools
I got jewels on the table, ready for the photoshoot
I just had to call jeweler 'cause he dripping off the juice
What you know
What you know 'cause I be speaking 'bout the truth
What you know (x2)
