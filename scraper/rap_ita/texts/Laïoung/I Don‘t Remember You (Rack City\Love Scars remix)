I was born poor
Never born a loser
If you wanna win
Then you gotta choose us
Serial killer flow
Now I’m killing rumours
Everybody woke, you cannot confuse us

I don’t remember you (x2)

Counted these racks now my hands tired
Move when I sleep move like a giant
Shop when I sleep wake up imma buy it
She so confused so she getting fired
Yeah
The private number phone stay blowing
The private jet gonna cross the ocean
You put them diamonds on that Ferragamo
You got that Louis Vuitton but you can’t buy the time
Cause all of that don’t mean anything
All your ice don’t mean anything
Forget the price and forget the rings
I was born poor
Never born a loser
If you wanna win
Then you gotta choose us
Serial killer flow
Now I’m killing rumours
Everybody woke, you cannot confuse us

I don't remember you (x2)

I cannot remember all the bad times cause I’m only focused on the good ones
Do better than my best yeah that’s every time
You know that Laioung he a good one
I travel overseas got my cash with me
I planted all these seed I come back with 3
Uhm, excuse me I come back with trees
I can’t follow anybody I follow my dreams
Don’t you ever stand next to me
Cause if you sleeping on your destiny
You cannot understand your enemy
