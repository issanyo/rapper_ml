[Intro: Laioung & Malcky G]
The Triple R Mob
The Triple R Mob
Yo, Malcky G, yeh
Triple R Mob
Love my Jordans (?)
Uptown
I just love my Jordans

[Ritornello: Malcky G]
I think at all my Jordans
I think at all my Jordans
I think I'm Michael Jordan
Cause all I do is scoring
All the girls love me
But I just love my Jordans
I just love my Jordans
I just love my Jordans
I just love my Jordans

[Strofa 1: Malcky G]
I've got so much carisma
They love my performances
I've got so many Jordans
I don't know where I can store 'em
My store is uptown
Rather far the old town
Oh white red blows
I've got Jordans for now
You are the smallest in the city
Now we're movin' over seas
And I came back from the Bronx, I've got a family with me
When I got new Jordans I make more euros
And I just love my Jordans cause I make new papers

[Bridge: Malcky G]
I just love my Jordans
I really love my Jordans
I just love my Jordans
I just love my Jordans

[Ritornello: Malcky G]
I think at all my Jordans
I think at all my Jordans
I think I'm Michael Jordan
Cause all I do is scoring
All the girls love me
But I just love my Jordans
I just love my Jordans
I just love my Jordans
I just love my Jordans

[Strofa 2: Laioung]
I wake up in the morning
I think I'm in love with my Jordans
I'm sorry I'm going (?) Florence
My little brother has to say that Jordans get importance
We (?) in the summer and (?) see we come in
Is too easy for some winners, you know how we started
I've got the 45, euros (?) my size
Don't get about the prize
See my Jordans (?) cause it's more than nice
See my Jordans (?) cause it's more than nice
It don't matter what you wear
It don't matter what you wear, it's how you wear it

[Bridge: Malcky G]
I just love my Jordans
I really love my Jordans
I just love my Jordans
I just love my Jordans

[Ritornello: Malcky G]
I think at all my Jordans
I think at all my Jordans
I think I'm Michael Jordan
Cause all I do is scoring
All the girls love me
But I just love my Jordans
I just love my Jordans
I just love my Jordans
I just love my Jordans

[Outro]
Laioung in your eardrum
