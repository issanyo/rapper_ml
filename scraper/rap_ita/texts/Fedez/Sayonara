[Chorus]
I could stay a little bit
I could stay a little bit more
But I just wanna take a breath
And keep it on the floor
Like a Sayonara to the world

[Verse 1]
Take this, take that, I am here
You don't know me, have a check, no fear
You don't here me when I attack I'm near
Me da paras, infect you with my poison for real
You da bettle, victim in da middle
This is how I fight, my words plus a beat on
Coming with that kinda flow that scores you a little
Yours that kinda face where I use to spit on
Mouth like a batsuka, terminator
I could be behind you, look at you radar
Me da nomad, no place where I stay ya!
Ain't visit the undergroud yet, stay high

[Pre-Chorus]
Break it out now, break it out now
Break it out now, break it out now
Moves like a tiger, living in the jungle
I'm a man in a struggle

[Chorus]
I could stay a little bit
I could stay a little bit more
(Take a breath now)
(Take a deep breath)
(Take a breath now)
(Take a deep breath)
But i just wanna take a breath
And keep it on the floor
Like a Sayonara to the world
I could stay a little bit
I could stay a little bit more
(Take a breath now)
(Take a deep breath)
(Take a breath now)
(Take a deep breath)
But i just wanna take a breath
And keep it on the floor
Like a Sayonara to the world

Sayonara alè!
Sayo!
Sayonara alè!

[Verse 2]
Take this, take that too
Here is the key, try to enter the room
Here is the flow, are you feeling the mood?
If you see me far try to push the zoom!
You da bettle, victim in da middle
This is how I fight, my words plus a beat on
Coming with that kinda flow that scores you a little
Yours that kinda face where I use to spit on

[Bridge]
Wanna take this one as the last
Feeling the air like I be da one blessed
It's like fire, rise up as a tower
You see me as an alien, but I'm not possessed

[Pre-Chorus]
Break it out now, break it out now
Break it out now, break it out now
Moves like a tiger, living in the jungle
I'm a man in a struggle

[Chorus]
I could stay a little bit
I could stay a little bit more
(Take a breath now)
(Take a deep breath)
(Take a breath now)
(Take a deep breath)
But i just wanna take a breath
And keep it on the floor
I could stay a little bit
I could stay a little bit more
(Take a breath now)
(Take a deep breath)
(Take a breath now)
(Take a deep breath)
But i just wanna take a breath
And keep it on the floor
Like a Sayonara to the world

Sayonara alè!
Sayo!
