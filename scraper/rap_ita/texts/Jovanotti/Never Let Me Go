I saw you one for your body
Two for your smile rockin' around the party
When the beat is wild an' when the ragamuffin'
Vibe is at the top get up an' sing yeoh
I say three for your attitude
Four for your face rockin' around the music
That the Deejay plays saw you rolling
Over me my baby sing yeoh
YOU GOT ME GIRL
GIRL NEVER LET ME GO
YOU GOT ME GIRL NEVER LET ME GO
Some of them were risin' up some of theme
Were goin' down you're a girl and you're fine
You're the best around I thank God' cause
I don't believe in wot I found sing yeoh
And now the city is like heaven
And the street is like a beach I'm rockin' over
Rolling over got no money but
I'm rich I fee, fee, fee, feel a vibration
Get up and sing yeoh YOU GOT ME GIRL
GIRL NEVER LET ME GO
YOU GOT ME GIRL NEVER LET ME GO
The day, the night
The dark and the light
The left and the right
I'm feeling all right
YOU GOT ME GIRL
GIRL NEVER LET ME GO YOU GOT ME GIRL
NEVER LET ME GO NEVER LET ME GO
I saw you one for your body
Two for your smile rockin' around the party
When the beat is wild an' when the ragamuffin'
Vibe is at the top get up an' sing yeoh
I say three for your attitude
Four for your face rockin' around the music
That the Deejay plays
Saw you rolling over me
My baby sing yeoh YOU GOT ME GIRL
GIRL NEVER LET ME GO
YOU GOT ME GIRL NEVER LET ME GO
Some of them were risin' up some of theme
Were goin' down you're a girl and you're fine
You're the best around
I thank God' cause I don't believe in wot
I found sing yeoh and now the city is like heaven
And the street is like a beach
I'm rockin' over, rolling over got no money
But I'm rich I fee, fee, fee, feel a vibration get up
And sing yeoh YOU GOT ME GIRL
GIRL NEVER LET ME GO YOU GOT ME
GIRL NEVER LET ME GO
The day, the night
The dark and the light
The left and the right
I'm feeling all right YOU GOT ME GIRL
GIRL NEVER LET ME GO
