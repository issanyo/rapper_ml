Hey you
Honeydew
I can not sleep
I don't know what to do
I'm lookin' for a girl to spend the night
Makin' dirty things 'till the early light
And when you wake up in the morning
And you see I'm gone
Check this out, cos' you're not alone
I love you, I'm waitin' like a dynamite
Baby come to me, cos' I need you tonight
I need you tonight, I want you tonight
I love you, I want you, I need you tonight
Hey love how do you feel
When I talk to you
I really feel so real
Cos' your voice is cool, is a special sound
So please my honey, please come around
Right down the club when I saw you last night
Your eyes were brown
But they were shinin' bright
You asked me that song, I told you yes
I think I'm in love baby, I must confess
I need you tonight...
Well baby you are so sweet
You make me dance
Like a special beat
I wanna dance with you, wanna make it right
I wanna do it all day and do it all night
Yes I know you're a child but I'm a child too
Take a ride baby I think I need you
Yes I know you're a child
But I'm a young boy too
Let's take a ride baby, I think I need you
Hey you what you gonna do
You're always on the phone
But your not alone
I got you, your mother
Your sister and your brother
Got the bills to pay gettin' bigger everyday
You are a son of a gun with no income
Just girls on your brain, you're drivin' me insane
I can't take no more
Of all these chores
Cos' it's telephone I'm workin' for
Hello! Hey you what you doin'now
Did you listen to me on the radio today
OK I've dedicated you a song baby
Bye bye
