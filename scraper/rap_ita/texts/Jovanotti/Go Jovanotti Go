JovanottI
Baby, baby, do you wanna drive my car?
Because I can't get the licence, I'm just a superstar
I got the black leather jacket and a baseball hat
I don't look at the words, I just care for the facts                                   I just wear 501's with a cut on my knee
Sometimes I get drunk then I dance to the beat
I wanna rock, I wanna funk, I wanna jack you up
Come on fly girls, homeboys don't stop
(Go, go, go...) He, he, he, he
I wanna see I wanna hear
He, he, he, he
I wanna see I wanna hear                               Jovanotti
Pump it up, pump it up get off the wall
80's are gone, it's the 90's y'all
So come on baby, baby stay on the line
My name is Jovanotti, gonna make you mine
Rock, rock y'all, you're body jam
Rockin' to the rhythm of the beat, bam bam
Here we go, let's rock, let's pump it up
Yo yo yo, don't stop
(Go, go, go, go, go, go!)
He, he, he, he
I wanna see I wanna hear
He, he, he, he
I wanna see I wanna hear                                Jovanotti
Four and three and two and one
If you're ready to party gonna have big fun
Pump it up, pump it up get off the wall
Tell your mama don't break my balls
Baby, baby get on my bike
My name is Jovanotti, gonna do it right
The number one rapper, the best DJ
Just gotta do just what I say                                   Open up your eyes and recognize my face
To the beat of the drum and the sound of the bass
Pump it up y'all, pump it up y'all, come on
My name is Jovanotti, king of the microphone
(Go, go, go, go, go, go!)
He, he, he, he
I wanna see I wanna hear
He, he, he, he
I wanna see I wanna hear                              Jovanotti!
