You got
Just, just, just, just, just walkin'
Just, just, just, just, just walkin'
Just, just, just, just, just walkin'
Just, just, just, just, just, my girl
Just, just, just
Just, just, just, just
Just, just, just
Just, just
Walk, walk, walk
Pump up the volume...
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Walkin' down, walkin' down
Walkin' down, walkin' down
Well
Walkin', I'm walkin' down
I've made a lotta people
Feel like a game of fun, oh yes
All together up and down
I wonder what's the way
To find a better place
Baby, take the step
Turnin’ to the left
I can have a big fun from movin'
Then I chase my mind
Turnin’ to the right
We have to keep in touch
I'm lookin' for you baby, baby
Well, hi everybody
I wanna spend my time
I'm gonna turn you on
I'm gonna make you mine
My name is Joe, I rock the mike
So listen to the show
I'm gonna make you say
One for the treble, two for the bass
C'mon to me, let's rock this place
I wanna, I'm gonna turn on the light
To the rhythm of my heart
I'm gonna take you right
Sit up, party people
She got the beat
My voice is a bomb
Make you feel you’ve never been
When you get up, make it lottie dottie
We don’t cause trouble, we don’t bother nobody
So listen close baby, don't you miss
Here we go with a special sound like this
I'm the number one rapper
You're the best deejay
Everybody's got to give up
Do what we say
We're the new generation of deejays
Turntable
Everywhere I'm gonna say
It's gonna turn you on
C'mon, party people in the house say aw
Say one, two, three, four
Comin' up now
Boogin’ it, people
Beat, bang, bang
And clap your hands
Let me see you jam
Get on y'all, boogie
You never stop
C'mon party people
Gimme wot you got
I'm a funkin' MC
I get on the mike
Just walkin' to the left
Walkin' to the right
That's my brand new record
The first I've done
Walk, walk, walk, walkin'
To get some fun
I hope you like it
I hope you dance
I hope the deejay will be my last chance
Please Mr deejay, put the record on
I got a family man, I gotta turn ‘em on
Walkin', I'm walkin'down
Oh, have a good time baby
Walkin', I'm walkin' down
That's right
