Yo babe
You wanna come to party?
Come on yo...alright
I am the party president
If you wanna get up
You don't pay the rent
I am the boss of feeling good
I got the key to your good mood
So come on you participate
It's now the time to celebrate
Par par party check up this beat
Now boys and girls get on your feet

I am the president of the noise
I got the power in my voice
Let me know "baby intelligent"
Hold on to the party president

You can stop the drummer
You can stop the bass
Five, six, seven, eight get into the race
You can stop the sequencer
You can stop the move
Five, six, seven, eight get into the groove

Yo yo babe
Pump it up the noise
Leave your parents out
Drive me crazy

Funky

I'm the party president
If you wanna get up
You don't pay the rent
I'm the boss of feeling good
I got the key to your good mood
I'm the president of the noise
I got the power in my voice
Let me know "baby intelligent"
Hold on to the party president

You can stop the drummer
You can stop the bass
Five, six, seven, eight get into the race
You can stop the sequencer
You can stop the move
Five, six, seven, eight get into the groove

I am the number one
Make me feel good
Drive my crazy
Turn me on, man
Jovanotti for president

Everybody around the country
It is now the time to break the speakers join the party
Let's get down to the bass vibration
No melody, no more melody
Just noise
I wanna you to sweat
To keep the jacket in club
No more ties in the disco
No more melody, no more melody
Bring the noise

One, two, get down
Yo brothers and sisters
You gotta say wo oh oh
You gotta say yo oh oh

I got to know, are you ready for a dynamite show
Tonight we're gonna party like there's no tomorrow
Open up your eyes
Recognize my face
To the beat of the drum
And the sound of the bass
Pump it up yo, pump it up yo, come on
Are you ready to party tum the radio on
