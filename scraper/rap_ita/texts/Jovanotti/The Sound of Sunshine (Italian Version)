One two three, uhuh

I wake up in the morning its six o'clock
They say there may be rain but the sun is hot
I wish i had some time just to kill today
And i wish i had a dime for every bill i've got to pay
Some days you lose you win
And the water's as high as the times your in
So i just back in there where i learned to swim
Try to keep my head above it the best i can
That's why

Here i am, waiting for this storm to pass my by
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down

One two three, uhuh

I saw my friend bobby i said "what's up man"
You got a little work or twenty to lend
I opened up my hand he said "i'm glad to see
They can take away my job but not my friends"

Here i am, waiting for the storm to pass my by
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down

I wanna go where the summer never ends
With my guitar on the beach there with all my friends
The suns so hot and the waves in motion
And everything smells like sun tan lotion
The ocean, and the girls so sweet
So kick off your shoes and relax your feet
They say that miracles are never seizing
And every single soul needs a little releasing
The sterio bumpin till the sun goes down
And i only wanna hear that sound

That's the sound of sunshine coming down
That's the sound of sunshine coming down

I said you're the one i wanna be with
When the sun goes down
I said you're the one i wanna be with
When the sun goes down
Singin you're the one i wanna be with
When the sun goes down

That's the sound of sunshine coming down
That's the sound of sunshine coming down
