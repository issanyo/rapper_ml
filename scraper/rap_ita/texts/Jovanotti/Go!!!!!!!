Baby baby di you wanna drive my car
Cause i can't get the licence i'm just a superstar
I got the black leather jacket an a basaball hat
I don't look at the words i just care for the facts

I just wear 501's with a cut on my knee
Sometimes i get drunk then i dance to the beat
I wanna rock I wanna funk wanna jack you up
Come on fly girls home boys don't stop

He he he he
I wanna see I wanna hear...

Pump it up pump it up get off the wall
80's are you gone it's the 90's y'all
So com'n baby baby stay on the line
My name is Jovanotti gonna make you mine

Rock rock y'all you're body jam
Rocking to the rhythm o' the beat bam bam
Here we go let's rock let's pump it up
Yo yo yo... don't stop

He he he he
I wanna see I wanna hear...

Four and three and two and one
If you're ready to party gonna have big fun
Pump it up pump it up get off the wall
Tell your mama don't break my balls
Baby baby get on my bike
My name is Jovanotti gonna do it right
The number 1 rapper the best DJ
Just got to do just what i say

Open your eyes and recognize my face
To the beat o' the drum and the sound of the bass
Pump it up y'all pump it up y'all come on
My name is Jovanotti king o' the microphone

He he he he
I wanna see I wanna hear...
He he he he
I wanna see I wanna hear...
