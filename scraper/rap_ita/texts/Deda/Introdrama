[Strofa: Sean]
So many glances are staring at me no many chances
I'm fooling again in any kind of bad circumstances
I jump out of my skin
And fall out through the ceiling
I watch my body land on the floor my nose is bleeding
But I try to control this pain from growing insane
My eyes at the back of my head I see my brain
I swear I'm cold as ice
I hope my breath can stop
My body from shivering not scared to death
I hear somebody calling me from another dimension
I open the door, blood on the floor, flesh on the walls
Across there was the door
Before it's too late
I hear somebody tellin' me
I cannot change my fate
So I turn around and see the devil stand right in front of me
He's got my heart in his white hand, he's laughing at me
"Yo Sean, the show is over now I come to take your soul"
I say "what?"
"there's no looking back, be ready to go"
I start screaming
That's when I wake up in my bed sheets
When I thank the Lord I'm not dead, I was just dreaming
I rush into the bathroom, I wash my face, look in the mirror
Open my mouth and see my theet all out of place
I lose balance, collapse unconcious on the floor
I knock my chin against the base, now I break my jaw
I won't back again, that's the end and what else can I tell
There's no return I think I fell in the hell

[Ritornello](x2)
I'm sick hell, smashed tough I can't get out alive
I can't breathe
I sang into the other side
I fell dead
Straight in hell, I can't move
I crash into a pond of blood
I'm paralyzed
