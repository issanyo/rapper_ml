[Verse 1: Skits Vicious]
Is this the real life? Or is it fantasy?
I’m just a poor boy I need no sympathy
Easy come easy go
Little high little low
Cutting edge style of this machete flow
We about to blow like somebody left the gas on
Killed the front row with a GoPro strapped on
Bad Taste got my tongue numb rub gums
We keep rappers' in a cage, Get the stun guns
It’s time to separate the [?]
Leatherface, Sicker than the case of Ebola
You don’t know you will never ever
Stick my tongue out, Bad Taste, [?]

[Verse 2: Dopey Rotten]
Things me and my crew do you might find disgraceful
Pins dolls voodoo we always keep it tasteful
China shop raging bull bound easy break through
Think you’re sick as fuck, But what you got is common flu
Hell you’ll have to go through
You can come join us
Everybody dies at the end, That’s a spoiler
Everything destroyer, I’m coming right for you
You should’ve known death is right around the corner
Now here we go again Rotten knows better
Always stuck together it’s still rain of terror
It’s not a cup of tea it’s whatever (whatever)
So fuck what you think I’ll have bad taste forever

[Hook]
Tears don’t effect me, Disrespect me
Fuck being friendly
You wanna talk shit but machete’s don’t tweet
Bleed bitch bleed!

[Verse 3: Jay Reaper]
Ey yo I came for the budder, Hang for your mother
My energy I drain cause Mary Jane is my lover
Cane covered the brain the pain fades
Smother niggas up in my lane I maintain cover
Yeah I’m coming with them X’s, extra for my ex’s
Popping X I’m restless
Choke that bitch with her own neckless
Yeah I’m disrespectful
Ya niggas getting tested
All that money you invested, I reset it in a second
I just go-go with no breaks
Coco with no taste
Popo getting blazed
Then we dope-dope everyday
Just like Toto let it rain
In this game I know you disbelieve us
This shit I piss and breath it

[Hook]
Tears don’t effect me, Disrespect me
Fuck being friendly
You wanna talk shit but machete’s don’t tweet
Bleed bitch bleed!

[Verse 4: Nitro]
Puoi chiamarmi Paranoid
Parla Freud nei mattatoi
Basta una barra boy e ti salta la faccia come in Arkanoid
Del senno di poi son piene le fosse
Starei meglio forse se nelle fosse ci foste voi
Cosa cazzo vuoi, tu e la tua crew, di non so chi?
Faccio bù e ti accorcio il film e piangi più che in Dawson Creek
Sto coi Dope D.O.D, wigga flow you talk shit
I’m the black sheep who can’t kill the wolf of Wall Street
Sayonara, truce come Mario Bava
Fanno a gara mentre cambio bara
Ti abbraccio poi salto in aria
La vita è amara, quindi impara a far la lucha o muori
La mia penna spara e ammazza, Mara Salvatrucha homie
La tua salma cuoce in acqua calda dentro un boiler
Conosciamo la tua fine atroce senza spoiler
You disappoint the way I got my crew back
I keep my bad taste cause been ugly is the new black

[Outro]
Questa vita è splatter, Peter Jackson bad taste
La mia banda suona l'hardcore, Machete bad brains
Phyl The Payne
Fuck the rap game
Tears don’t effect me, Disrespect me
Fuck being friendly
You wanna talk shit but machete’s don’t tweet
Bleed bitch bleed!
