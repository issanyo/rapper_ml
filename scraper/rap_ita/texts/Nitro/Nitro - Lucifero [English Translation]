[Verse 1]
With me you get distracted when you know you are not all right?(yeah)
I never talk, only if you let me drink
I got no flags, neither barriers
Dad isn't a cop neither a banker
Knowledge is lie in Babel
If you don't love comment as much as be silent
Ok, who reassure me?
It's hard, be in trend is my culture
For the hypocrisy that increase the fear
They create the epidemy for selling you the cure
I'm not sitting, better thug than slave
There's more life in your screen than inside you
Not living forever, but I think the sky is too small for me

[Bridge]
I would like to be free
But I lack of oxygen
People that think for me
I don't need a king
For them I'm Lucifer
I look like what the others say about me
But they don't belive me
The only slave that now is king

[Chorus]
How much costs to be free?
Sometimes, to feel better, I must say: "No"
They will look above if I fall
Sometimes, to feel better, I must say

[Verse 2]
I can't control myself(uuh)
Between the wheels stray dogs with new collars
Evil acts in the frontal lobe
Scapegoat of the global hate
Until I will not look normal to these(ah)
It's all about balance, bad and good between my voids, they are filling them, oh
It's all relative, I'm not that bad but this is how they draw me
Because I haven't got claims to power since disobey is my duty
Banned from the God's Kingdom if I want one outside His will
But I'm better than this, better than this, yes, that I'm better than this(yes)
How many fails I can grant to me?
I must proceed now
I see sheeps repeat "Sheeps" to other sheeps
It's hard for me to belive
That at the end of all, we will be more equal to eachothers
Not more humans, but piles of ash
I will leave these vipers wait on the shores of the Tiber(ehi)
Don't cry for me because I can defend myself
From the abyss that is between psyche and darkness
I got too much to say for stop
Now I can understand my demon
I want to subvert the rules
Die to belive
Suffer to grow
I hoped in an end like this
Remember me(remember me, remember me, remember me)

[Bridge]
I would like to be free
But I lack of oxygen
People that think for me
I don't need a king
For them I'm Lucifer
I look like what the others say about me
But they don't belive me
The only slave that now is king

[Chorus]
How much costs to be free?
Sometimes, to feel better, I must say: "No"
They will look above if I fall
Sometimes, to feel better, I must say: "No"
