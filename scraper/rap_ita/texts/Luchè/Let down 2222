[Verse 1]
If you hold me right
I'll let you know
If you hold me right, I
If you let me ride
Would you stay calm ?
If you let me ride, I
Don't let me down
Or hide me below
Could you love me right ?, I

[Chorus]
Don't let me down
Or i'll be going (Or i'll be going)
(low)
Don't let me down
(low) (low) (low)
(Don't let me down)

[Verse 2]
If you let me dry
I won't grow high
If you let me dry, I
Please let me try
I won's stay long
Please let me try, I
If you let me down
I will be crawling
Don't let me down
'cause i'd die for you (i'd die for you)

[Verse 3]
Cryin' for you and i know it
Cryin' for you and i show it
I'm here for you
'cause i know you need me
But you never want me
Never need me
(I'd die for you)
I will meet you and i know when
We will meet soon and i know it
Promise we will, promise it well, promise it right, i wish you well
(I wish you well)

Promise we will, promise we will
(Promise it well)
Promise we will, promise we will
Promise it well, promise it well
I will meet you and i know when
(Promise we'll meet, i knwo we will)*2
